A method was developed for the headspace vapor of tobacco was
developed. Helium gas was passed through a column of Tenax GC. The
volatile components were adsorbed on an OV-101 column cooled to -30° C. Temper-
ature programs were prepared in such a way that all compounds could be eluted.
The method was applied to several varieties of tobacco and the results show
that the headspace analysis is very reproducible, character-
istic volatile components can be identified. Considerable information
can be obtained from this type of analysis. The quantitative data are valuable information
for identifying specific types of tobacco. A correlation exists between the amount of
other chemicals present. It is possible to distinguish between tobacco grades on the basis
of headspace composition. 17 different compounds in the flue-cured tobacco

If there is not sufficient data for
identifying each constituent,

of several U.S. varieties were identified with this method.

SECTION II – HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS INFORMATION

Identity:
Magtoxin Spot Fumigant, Fumi-Cel®, Fumi-Strip®. Magnesium Phosphide, Mg₃P₂. Reacts with water to produce phosphine, hydrogen
phosphide, PH₃ as shown in Equation 1. Magtoxin is formulated with 60% magnesium phosphide and also contains ammonium
carbamate and inert ingredients. Ammonium carbamate releases ammonia and carbon dioxide as shown in Equation 2.

1) Mg₃P₂ + 6H₂O → 3Mg(OH)₂ + 2PH₃   2) NH₄COONH₄ → 2NH₃ + CO₂
                                                 NH₄COONH₄ CAS No. 1111-78-0

Magtoxin is available in porous blister packs called the Magtoxin Spot Fumigant. Fumi-Cel is produced by impregnating
magnesium phosphide into a polymer end-of-tube, and it is formed by attaching, through an adhesive, magnesium phosphide to the Fumi-
Strip is formed by attaching, end-to-end, the coil of the Fumi-Cel plates. Fumi-Cel® and Fumi-Strip® contain carbon dioxide
and ammonia. All metal phosphides produce poison in gas-tight containers.

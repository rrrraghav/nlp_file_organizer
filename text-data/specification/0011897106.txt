1 Finished product specifications are based on B&W standard R&D analytical methods as of 2/1/93.

2 Control interval is defined as 40,000 lbs. of production.

3 This target reflects the new B&W method which specifically measures fructose, glucose, and sucrose,
not total sugars. This is NOT a change from the previous specification of 4.0-8%, as measured by
the Alpekem chemistry. Subject to revision with additional historical history.

4 Moisture should be charted and controlled by 40,000 lbs. intervals, but has the additional restriction
that no product may exceed the 13% limit.

NOTES:

Basis weight, air permeability and caliper limits apply to the average of ten samples tested at random from
a pallet or strip cords representing a pallet.

To obtain valid test results, when samples are obtained from vendor sample cards, one strip will be selected
from each different sample card position; if less than ten positions are available, each position
will be sampled at least once and no more than twice per test.

To obtain valid test results, samples must be conditioned/tested using TAPPI T402M.

Stated values are based on Philip Morris Richmond Q.A. instruments.

NOTES:
* Critical - Accept/reject criteria.
* Typical - Monitored for trends, could result in a rejection as a result of machinability problems.
* Limits apply to averages of 10 samples tested at random from a pallet or strip cards representing a pallet for; basis weight, caliper, porosity, tensile, elongation, and opacity.
* To obtain valid test results, when samples are obtained from vendor sample cards, one strip will be selected from each of ten different sample card positions. At least three positions are available, each position will be sampled at least once and no more than twice per test.
* Limits apply to averages of 10 refills tested at random from the lot for citrate, CaCO3 and edge tear.
* To obtain valid test results, samples must be conditioned/tested using TAPPI T402M.
* Stated values are based on Philip Morris Procedure IQ instruments.
* Determination of X-Ray fluorescence, Richmund to be QA'd at later date.

The Interview

(1) Q: Why is Merit sponsoring THE MERIT REPORT?

A: Merit cigarettes decided to sponsor THE MERIT REPORT
as a public service project with two objectives in mind.

First, to offer a forum -- both on a regional and national
level -- for Americans to express their opinion on important
news issues and events in their lives.

Secondly, to relay that broad-based opinion consensus to the
media.

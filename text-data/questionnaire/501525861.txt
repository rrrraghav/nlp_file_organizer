ANSWERS TO POSSIBLE QUESTIONS ON
CASING MATERIALS AND FLAVORANTS

Q: ACCOUNTS OF SMOKING PRODUCT MANUFACTURE DESCRIBE THE USE OF SEVERAL TYPES OF
ADDITIVES, NAMELY, CASING MATERIALS AND FLAVORANTS. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THESE MATERIALS?

A: IN GENERAL, CASING MATERIALS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF USE ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS.
THEY INCLUDE SUCH MATERIALS AS SUGAR, LICORICE, COCOA, AND GLYCEROL. THEIR
USE ORIGINATED IN THE MID-1800S WITH CHEWING TOBACCO, WAS CONTINUED INTO THE
ERA OF PIPE TOBACCO, AND NOW THEY ARE USED ON CIGARETTE TOBACCOS.

SUGAR IN SMOKING PRODUCTS WAS FOUND TO CONTROL SMOKE pH BY LOWERING IT, THUS
MAKING THE SMOKE EASIER TO INHALE. DURING THE SMOKING PROCESS, SUGARS CON-
TRIBUITE ACIDIC COMPONENTS TO THE SMOKE WHICH OFFSET OR "CANCEL OUT" THE EFFECT
OF SOME OF THE BASES IN THE SMOKE. LICORICE IMPARTS A CERTAN SWEETNESS AND
WOODY NOTE WHICH ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE SMOKE; COCOA PROVIDES A DESIRABLE
FLAVOR; GLYCEROL - SINCE IT IS HYGROSCOPIC, i.e., WILL TAKE UP WATER - PREVENTS
AN OPEN PACK OF CIGARETTES FROM DRYING OUT. GLYCEROL IS ALSO A MANUFACTURING
AID TO FACILITATE THE CUTTING OF TOBACCO INTO THE SHRED SIZE USED IN CIGARETTE
FILLER.

FLAVORANTS ARE USUALLY HIGHLY FLAVORED MATERIALS FOUND EITHER IN TOBACCO AND/OR
SMOKE OR ON A GOVERNMENT APPROVED LIST OF FLAVORANTS, THE SO-CALLED GRAS LIST
(GRAS = GENERALLY REGARDED AS SAFE).

THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASING MATERIALS AND FLAVORANTS INSOFAR AS USE ON
CIGARETTE TOBACCO IS CONCERNED IS THAT A FEW PERCENT BY WEIGHT OF THE FORMER MAY
BE APPLIED TO THE TOBACCO WHEREAS THE LATTER, THE FLAVORANTS, ARE GENERALLY
USED AT LEVELS IN THE PARTS PER MILLION RANGE, i.e., AT LEVELS OF A FEW
TEN-THOUSANDS OF A PERCENT BY WEIGHT. ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS USE

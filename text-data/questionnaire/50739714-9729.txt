FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES...



The Department of Environmental Hygiene has during the last
decade pursued research concerning the effects of different
environmental factors on the individual’s health. This
questionnaire is a part in the research program.

From the scientific point of view, it is of greatest importance
that all co-operate.

Please answer all the questions as carefully as possible and
then read through the questionnaire once more to check that
no question has been left blank.

The enclosed envelope does not need any stamps. All that is
necessary is to drop the envelope in the nearest mailbox.

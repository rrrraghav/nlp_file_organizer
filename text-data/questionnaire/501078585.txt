DORAL CONTINUOUS AWARENESS STUDY

MRD # 9-2-201
EMR # 11-900

On both versions (white and blue) of the questionnaire, a question was
omitted. That is, when a respondent says Doral is his/her usual brand, we
want to know what the previous usual brand was.

Therefore, the following instructions apply to question 2:

IF USUAL BRAND GIVEN IS DORAL, ASK

2e. "What was your usual brand just before you started smoking Doral?"
f. “Is that a filter, or a non-filter cigarette?”

IF FILTER, ASK

g. “Is that the extra-long, 100mm size or not?”
h. “Is that a menthol cigarette or not?”

Record this information at the bottom of the first page.

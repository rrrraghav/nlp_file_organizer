SECTION SELF

INT : All I want you to do is to take a look at that, fantasize
and tell me a story about it.
INT : It looks to me like the guy is from the city and
he has a kind of pressured job. Possibly fast-moving and has made
it into a time where he can relax. Get his thoughts together. I
notice he’s smoking. Generally speaking, taking in all these things
that he's not used to taking in on a weekly, monthly type basis.
Just getting away from it all. Putting a lot of thoughts together.
Trying to get a lot of loose ends tied together and trying to get
them back into perspective again.
INT : What do you mean city?
INT : It looks to me like this scene is a very desolate,
peaceful area and I am talking about the way he is dressed, his hair,
looks to me like he would be in an office position - White collar.
INT : What about the way he is dressed, does it go together?
If you were there, would you dress that way?
INT : Yes. Sweaters, slacks... looks like hush puppies. It
looks right.
INT : Do you think he is alone?
INT : I think he is very alone, capturing a lot of things he
has missed out for quite a while, looks like.
INT : Is he content doing that right now?
INT : I think so.

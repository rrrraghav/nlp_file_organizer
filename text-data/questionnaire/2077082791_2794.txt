QUESTION FOR DAVID OGDEN

Do you agree that the health risks associated with smoking have been known and widely publicized for decades? Indeed, weren’t those risks spelled out more than 35 years ago in the 1964 Surgeon General's report, which was issued months before Congress enacted Medicare?

Do you agree that the Congress could have excluded smoking-related illnesses from the Medicare program if it had wanted to? Instead, it chose to continue to provide billions of dollars of federal money in treating diseases that the federal government itself had concluded were attributable to smoking?

And now, 35 years later, the President proposes to sue the tobacco industry to recover these expenditures. Does that raise any concerns in your mind?

Dear Panelist:

With this ballot I am sending you ten packs of cigarettes coded as follows: K2 - 3 packs,
E4 - 3 packs, R8 - 4 packs. Remember, you do not have to smoke all of the cigarettes –
only as many as you need to complete the questionnaire.

When this questionnaire is completely filled out, please return it to me in the enclosed
postage-paid envelope. Thank you very much – your cooperation in this test is most
helpful.

Panel Leader

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BALLOT BEFORE STARTING TEST

PART I

First smoke some of the cigarettes marked K2 and then the cigarettes marked E4.
Then compare the two cigarettes with each other and complete the questions below:



     K2   E4   Both    Neither
1. The smoke was too strong or too harsh. -------------------------------------
2. It was a satisfying, pleasurable smoke. ------------------------------------
3. The smoke was too hot. -------------------------------------
4. The smoke was flavorful and fresh-tasting. -----------------------------------
5. It was too weak a cigarette. -------------------------------------
6. The smoke of the cigarette smelled bad. -------------------------------------

Now, all things considered, which do you prefer?
(circle one) K2   E4  No Preference



PART II

Now smoke the cigarettes marked R8. Smoke only as many as you need in order to
make this judgment. If you need to refresh your memory, go back and smoke some
of the K2 and E4 cigarettes. Be sure to circle one or the other, even if you are
uncertain.

R8 is more like K2 or E4 (circle one)

VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

This is an appeal to you to cooperate in a scientific
study which will contribute valuable information of great im-
portance to public health.

The rapid decrease in the use of tobacco in recent
years has created considerable interest and questions re-
garding the possible effects on health. The evidence
available does not provide definite answers, and it is
essential whether or not the use of tobacco is a reason-
able factor in determining life expectancy. We are ask-
ing you to assist us in this study by answering honestly
in order to obtain a dependable answer.

Consequently the Veteran Administration is cooperat-
ing with the National Heart Institute in a survey of
this question by distributing this questionnaire.

Only a few minutes of your time will be required to
complete it and your contribution makes you a partner
in an important effort. Your cooperation is earnestly
solicited, as you are helping the government make this valuable research study.

With many thanks for your cooperation, I am

Sincerely yours,

(Signed)
Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs

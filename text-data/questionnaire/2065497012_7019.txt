April, 1999

Dear Participant in the 1999 Strategic Learning conference:

Please fill out this questionnaire and bring it to the Conference Board workshop. These questions represent your opinions about the organization in which you work. If you are a consultant, you can answer them with regard to any single unit within which you are working. It is more accurate to answer these questions for a single unit in the organization rather than the organization as a whole. For example, you might look at a work team or a single department or division within a company. For a validated organization-wide result, you would need a larger organizational sample.

We will be collecting this questionnaire on March 29, and using the results in the last session to discuss the instrument’s use in diagnosing areas of strength and weakness around strategic learning. We do not ask you to put your name on the questionnaire, and we will not use names in reporting out results. Thank you for joining us in this activity.

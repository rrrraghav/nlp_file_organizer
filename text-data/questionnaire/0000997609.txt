PANELIST QUESTIONNAIRE

INSTRUCTIONS: After you have smoked least one pack of the test cigarettes, fill out this questionnaire.

Each question has three parts: The first part asks about the best cigarette; the second part asks about the brand you smoke most often; and the third part asks about an ideal cigarette for you.
Be sure to read each set of questions carefully and circle the answer that best describes how you feel about the cigarettes.

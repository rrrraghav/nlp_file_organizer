VICEROY VERBATIM COMMENTS TO:

7b. What do you believe was the main idea in the (SPECITY BRAND PRO QU. 5 OR QU. 6) advertising? I mean, what are the main things they are trying to tell you?

Qu.
No.

00717 Like I said, it’s lower in tar than other.

00786 It isn't as strong as a Winston.

00665 To keep the name in front of the public.

00808 Oh, just that people on the move, sport type, smoke.

01312 That Viceroy is enjoyable.

01187 If a well known person endorses it, it might impress some people.

00295 To be a winner, smoke Viceroy.

00940 #1 - a competitive type commercial.

01981 Masculinity – no question in any of these commercials. A race car driver.

01985 They (sportsmen) smoke Viceroy. I don’t pay attention to main idea.

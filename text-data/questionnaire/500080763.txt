SMOKING AND HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE

Dear Parent or Guardian:

The School Authorities have permitted this questionnaire to be given to you. All replies are confidential. Your cooperation in helping us learn about the health habits of your children may we ask that you take a moment to fill out this important questionnaire. The replies that you give will help health officials form objective opinions about the cigarette and tobacco problem. All data will be used for research purposes only, and all answers will be kept confidential. Your young child should not see the questionnaire. Each parent or guardian should fill out a separate questionnaire. If you have more than one child in the same elementary school (grades 1-6 only) you need only fill out one set returning these to school with your oldest child. Thank you for your help and cooperation.

Sincerely,

William A. Packel, Supervisor
Smoking & Health Research Project

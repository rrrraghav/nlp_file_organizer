INTERVIEWER: I’m going to show you some things. Use your imagination
and tell me a little story about him.

: I like the way he's dressed. I can’t tell you a story...
A government building of some kind, maybe a lawyer.

INT : What do you think he’s thinking about?
: Who knows? You can never tell what a man is thinking
about…(laughs)…He’s very aloof, I have no idea.

INT : Does he look content to you, happy or sad?
: He looks like he is brooding about something. Something
serious that is on his mind. There's no smile in the eyes, no smile
in the face. Sober.

INT : How successful do you think he is?
: He’s arrived where he wants to be. If he is a lawyer
maybe he wants to be a very good lawyer and do his job good. Maybe
he's thinking about one of his cases. He’s cut one now and wants to
win it and that’s why he is in deep thought.

INT : What do you think about his personal relationships?
: He would have many girlfriends.

INT : Do you think he has a lot of friends in general?
: No. He's very select with his friends. He reminds
me of someone I used to know years ago and he was a jerk.

INT : Someone you knew well?
: I knew him well. As well as he would let anyone know.

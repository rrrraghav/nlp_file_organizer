Reporter is writing a story on "penguins and pop culture" and wants to include information on Brown & Williamson’s KOOL penguin. He wants the story to be “light and non-controversial” and filed the following questions:

Q1 When was the original penguin selected for KOOL? Why was it used as symbolism for the brand? Please provide any historical information you may have.

Willie the Penguin started with KOOL when the brand was introduced in 1933. He was featured in KOOL magazine and billboard advertising from the brand’s beginning, helping make KOOL an instant success.

Willie was a very hot KOOL penguin. He was on salt and pepper shakers, key chains and jewelry. Radio advertising started in 1946.

In the early 1960s, Willie retired from advertising when KOOL’s packaging was redesigned. Willie is still very popular today. Our consumers and cigarette memorabilia collectors contact us frequently for information about Willie.

Q2 What can you tell me about the new penguin?

The new penguin spokes-symbol is a younger cousin of Willie. He has been unwilling to release his name publicly saying he wants to hold down tail and offers of marriage.

I can say he is an updated, somewhat irreverent version of Willie and is part of one market test to broaden KOOL’s appeal with young adult smokers and update consumer perceptions of the product.

10. Okay, I’d like to leave 5 packs of cigarettes with you. First let me check them to
be sure they're the right type. (LOOK AT THE CODE NUMBER ON THE BOTTOM OF ALL
FIVE PACKS.) IF ANY OF THE PACKS ARE NOT MARKED 70360, DO NOT HAND THEM OUT AND
RETURN THE CIGARETTES WITH THIS QUESTIONNAIRE TO YOUR SUPERVISOR. IF ALL FIVE PACKS
ARE 70360, AND YOU HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY ARE THE CORRECT TYPE, GIVE THE FIVE
packs of these cigarettes and say not to smoke other brands while you're smoking
these. I’d like to come back soon to see how you’re doing and giving you
some more cigarettes. I’d like to come back as possible to the time
you’ve started smoking the cigarettes. Be sure you think you’ll have smoked
these five packs?

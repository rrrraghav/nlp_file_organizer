(22) asked of every other respondent. 1

023 NOW, I'M GOING TO READ YOU SOME STATEMENTS THAT MAY DESCRIBE YOUR OWN
BEHAVIOR OR OPINIONS AND FEELINGS. I’D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME HOW WELL
EACH STATEMENT DESCRIBES YOU. TO DO THIS, PLEASE USE A SCALE FROM 1
TO 10, WHERE 1 MEANS THE STATEMENT DOES NOT DESCRIBE YOU AT ALL, AND
10 MEANS THAT IT DESCRIBES YOU EXTREMELY WELL. OF COURSE, YOU MAY USE ANY
NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 10. (Repeat scale as necessary.)

THE FIRST/NEXT STATEMENT IS [insert statement]. HOW WELL DOES THIS
STATEMENT DESCRIBE YOU?

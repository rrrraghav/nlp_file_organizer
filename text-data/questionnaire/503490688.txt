QUESTIONNAIRE OUTLINE

1. Initial screening

2. Ask respondent to look at ads as would normally spending
as much time as he likes.

3. Ask main idea (for entire campaign).

4. User imagery questions - something like a 5-point scale.
"Based on this ad, would you say the kind of person who
smokes VANTAGE is . ."

   • mainstream, not snobbish?
   • equally likely to be male or female?
   • mature (not very young, not very old
     e.g., in 25-49 target)
   • knows now/likes to enjoy life

5. Product perceptions - based on the ads and what you may
already know about the cigarette:

   • tar • taste • smoothness • how enjoyable

(use same type scale as for FRET test)

6. (For VANTAGE Pleasures and VANTAGE Point cells only).

Smokers tell us that there are certain times they
really enjoy a cigarette, and other times when they
don’t really enjoy smoking that much. Looking at
these ads would you say:

The smokers are enjoying very much their cigarette,
somewhat, etc. (5 point scale).

7. (For VANTAGE Pleasures only, looking at the individual
executions).

For a moment I would like for you to think of yourself
as being in this picture, and tell me if:

   • This is a place you would like to return to,
     or how much you would like to be there, etc.
   • How appropriate this particular situation is
     for smoking
   • How good you think a cigarette would taste
     to you in this situation

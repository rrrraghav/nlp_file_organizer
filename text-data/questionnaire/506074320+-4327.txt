Hello, my name is _______________. We appreciate your coming in to help us today.

1. Now, I would like to review some of the information that we obtained when we talked to you earlier on the telephone.

(REFER TO Q.1 ON SCREENER)

Do you still smoke (USUAL BRAND) as your usual brand?

(IF SAME BRAND, RECORD BELOW AT Q.2A AND CONTINUE WITH Q.2. IF BRAND CHANGE, CORRECT
SCREENER AND PROBE FOR FULL STYLE INFORMATION. ENTER NEW BRAND NAME AT Q.2A AND
CONTINUE.)

2. As you know, cigarettes come in different styles such as menthol and non-menthol and
light and ultra lights, as well as different sizes.  These differences may or may not
have several particular styles. My next question refers only to brand name not
particular styles or sizes of the brand.

Think for a minute about all the cigarette brands that are currently on the market.
Besides (USUAL BRAND) what other two cigarette brands do you like best?
(RECORD ON GRID BELOW AT Q.2B AND Q.2.C.)



(USE FOLLOWING IF RESPONDENT CANNOT NAME 3 BRANDS.)

Let me explain a little more about what we’re trying to do...

Even though you may only smoke one brand regularly, there are probably other
brands on the market that you like. It's not necessary that you buy these
other brands as well as your usual brand, but that you believe you would like
them better than the other brands on the market. This may include brands you
have tried but never purchased for your own use.

Now, besides the brand(s) you’ve just mentioned, what other brand(s) do you like?
(RECORD ON GRID BELOW AT Q.2B/2.C IN ORDER MENTIONED. IF RESPONDENT REFUSES TO
LIST OTHER BRANDS 2 AND 3, SKIP TO Q.4.)

2a. Usual Brand _______________

2b. Second Choice _______________

2c. Third Choice _______________

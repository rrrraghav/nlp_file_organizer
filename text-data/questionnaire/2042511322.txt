TO BE ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED SMOKING ALL OF THE “N”
LITTLE CIGARS AND BEFORE YOU START SMOKING THE LITTLE CIGARS.

1. Now that you have tried the “N” Little Cigars, we would like to tell us how you think they compare
with what you usually smoke.

Please use the scorecard below -- here it done:

If the cigars are not as good as what you usually smoke, put an "X" in one of the boxes on the
left-hand side of the scorecard. The more dislike them, the closer the “X” should be to
the left-hand side.

If they are about the same as what you usually smoke, put an "X" in a box near the middle.

If they are better than what you usually smoke, put an "X" in one of the boxes on the right-hand side
of the scorecard. The more you like them, the closer the “L” should be to the right-hand sides.

This last part is somewhat different. One of the advertisments you saw
earlier in this issue is doing something new in trying to understand
how people feel about it.  Please read all the
OPEN MAGAZINE to RALEIGH AD.

Would you please read this ad again all the way through.

ALLOW UP TO 20 SECONDS FOR EACH MAGAZINE.

1. Please read this along with me and then "X" the one box for each
line that best describes your feeling about Raleigh cigarettes.

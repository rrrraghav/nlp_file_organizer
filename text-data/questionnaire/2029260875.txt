This questionnaire was prepared by the above mentioned lung cancer study group
at the Bremen Institute for Prevention Research and Social Medicine (BIPS). It
was translated in the course of a concerted action of the European Community
which was coordinated by D. Hemm and M. Goldberg, INSERM, Paris. It is a fur-
ther development of our questionnaire publ lished in:

Bolm-Audorff U, Ahrens W, Jöckel K.H., Mollik B, Gresius T, Timm A, Weihrauch H & Wetzelwitz, Experience with
supplementary questionnaires in a lung cancer case-referent study. In Hemm D, Goldberg M, eds. Proceedings of the
European concerted action on occupational exposures and health risks. Luxembourg: Office of the Official Publications of the European Communities,
1986; 117-120.

The questionnaire section on passive smoking was developed in collaboration with
the international study on lung cancer in non-smokers, coordinated by the IARC,
Lyon. It represents an early version of that questionnaire, which has since been
further developed.

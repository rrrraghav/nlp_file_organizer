INTERNSHIP FEEDBACK SURVEY

How has the Philip Morris experience compared to your expectations?

✓ Exceeded Expectations Met Expectations Below Expectations

I was very lucky to have had an experience that went far above any expectation I could have ever possibly hoped for. To have been able to take part in this Summer’s RECALL was a tremendously positive experience. The crazy nature of the “recall summer” exposed me to sides of business I could never have expected to view first hand. It may be safe to say that this summer's interns were the one’s to receive the most benefit from this incident.

What would have made the experience more meaningfully to you?
- I would have liked to spend more time working one-on-one with UMS and DM.
- I often felt I wasn’t learning as much as I could have been due to the fact that most of my work was done away from management's eyes.

- I would like to have been able to tap into the knowledge and skill of the managers (especially Dan Yoemans) but, instead, found myself learning completely through my own trial and error experiences.
What was the most interesting activity you were involved in?

The only area I became involved in was Recall, but within Recall, I would point to dealing with the retailers as the most interesting and enlightening activity I was involved in.

What was the most interesting activity you were involved in?
Believe it or not, the least interesting activity I was involved in was working in the field with a TSM.
Lucky for me, it was only two days. It is scary to think that I expected that to be my most interesting activity and on area I was considering as a career option."

WILLIAM F LORENZ JR

This is an appeal to you to participate in a scientific study which will certainly yield results of great importance to medicine and public health.

The rapid increase in the use of tobacco in recent years has caused much discussion in medical circles concerning its effects on health. It has not yet been possible to establish definitely whether or not the use of tobacco is a serious hazard, but it is essential to gather data from a large number of persons in order to obtain a dependable answer. Consequently the Veterans Administration is cooperating with the United States Public Health Service in a study of this question by distributing the enclosed questionnaire.

Only a few minutes of your time will be required to complete and return this questionnaire. It is entirely confidential, and no information which you supply will attract attention to yourself or be used for any purpose other than that specified in the introduction.

With many thanks for your cooperation, I am



Minister of Veteran Affairs

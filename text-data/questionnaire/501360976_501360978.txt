Hello, I am from .................................. and we’re getting
information about various products that people use.

A. Have you, yourself smoked any cigarettes in the past seven days or not?

(IF NO, GO TO QUESTION 1B. IF YES, GO TO QUESTION 1C.)

B. In there anyone there now 21 years of age or older who smokes cigarettes or not?

(IF NO ONE 21 OR OLDER WHO SMOKES, TERMINATE AND DO NOT USE FOR QUOTA.
IF YES, ASK TO SPEAK TO THAT PERSON AND REPEAT QUESTION 1A.)

C. How many cigarettes do you usually
smoke per day?
1-5.....................1
16-23.................2
24 or more...........3
Don’t know............9
Refused...............8

(IF PERSON SMOKES LESS THAN ONE CIGARETTE PER DAY OR DOES NOT KNOW, TERMINATE
AND DO NOT RECORD OR ENGAGE IN QUOTA.)

2A. Now, taking everything into account, I would like you to tell me how much
you like smoking. If you like smoking very much, you would give it a 9 or 10. If
you don’t like smoking at all, you would give it a 1 or 2. If you are
somewhere in between, you can give it any other number from 1-10. In other
words, the more you like smoking, the higher the number you would give it.
Now, what number from 1 to 10 best describes how much you personally like
smoking at the present time?

2B. Now I would like you to think about your feelings about the possible hazards
of smoking. We’ll use the same system of numbers: If you are absolutely
certain that there is no hazard, you would rate it a 1 or 2. If you have
no concern at all, you would give it a 3 or 4. If you would rate it a 5 or 6,
you are somewhat worried about the possible hazards. If you would rate it a 7, 8, 9,
or 10, you are very much concerned about the possible hazards of smoking.
What number from 1 to 10 best describes your feelings?

3. With you in mind, do you think there is any
benefit for the average cigarette smoker?
Yes.................1 No.................2
Don’t know............9 Refused...............8

4.  Do you ever feel guilty or regret over
smoking cigarettes?
Yes.................1 No.................2
Don’t know............9 Refused...............8

5.  Considering the cost, the effect on your
health, and any other factors, do you think
that smoking is worth while?
Yes.................1 No.................2
Don’t know............9 Refused...............8

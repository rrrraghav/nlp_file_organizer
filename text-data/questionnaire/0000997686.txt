PANELIST QUESTIONNAIRE

INSTRUCTIONS: After you have smoked at least one pack of the test cigarettes, fill out this questionnaire.

Each question has three parts: The first part asks about the taste of cigarettes, the second part asks about your most often used cigarette, and the third part asks about an ideal cigarette for you.

Be sure to read each set of questions carefully and circle the answer that best describes how you feel about the cigarettes.

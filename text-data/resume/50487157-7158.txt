RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

1. 1991-Present: Postdoc Fellow in Dr Dennis McCance’s Lab, University of Rochester.
Currently working on the replication and its regulation of Human Papillomaviruses
Type 6B, 11, 16, 18 and 31, focusing on the roles of two of the major open reading
frames products E1 and E2, using molecular biology techniques including cloning,
gene structure analysis, in vivo gene expression and DNA-protein interactions.

2. 1990-1991: Postdoc fellow in Dr. Ian Macara’s lab, University of Rochester.
Following work was carried out: High expression and purification of rab3A, a GTP-
binding protein as a potential cellular signal transducer; In E. coli development of
antibody to rab3A; oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of rab3A cDNA to change
codon 134 in order to decrease its GTP-binding ability; expression of wild-type and
mutagenized forms of rab3A in PC12 and NIH3T3 cells respectively; functional
analysis of rab3A in the signal transduction and its effects on cell differentiation.

3. 1985-1989 PhD student in the National Lab of Cell Biology in Beijing Normal
University. PhD thesis included: 1> Antissense RNA of Human c-Ha-ras1 decreased
endogenous p21ras expression level in human stomach cancer cell line NIH 3T3-823;
2> Calmodulin overexpression induced transformation of normal NIH3T3 cells; 3>
Establishment of cell line inducibly expressing v-Ha-ras oncogene.

Working Background

From 1962 to 1972 I worked for major corporations (Unilever,
Nestle, Gallagher and Glaxo) mainly on the international
side. I was responsible for conducting qualitative and
quantitative studies in the United Kingdom, Europe and the
United States.

While at art college, I ran my own qualitative research
company conducting studies for advertising agencies (e.g.
Ogilvy & Mather, D’Arcy McManus and J. Walter Thompson) and
corporations (e.g. H.J. Heinz and Unilever affiliates).

During this time I developed various projective techniques
for use in qualitative research based on my work in sociology
and the fine arts. In particular, the use of visual
stimulac, drawing and color.

In 1980 I came to the United States and worked for a number
of large research houses in New York before starting Trinette
Francis, Qualitative Research.

PERSONAL STATEMENT
My research interests focus on the molecular mechanisms of viral RNA replication and pathogenesis. I have developed a unique expertise in structural biology, biochemistry, and virology to address these questions. My long-term goal is to develop novel antiviral therapies that target essential viral processes.

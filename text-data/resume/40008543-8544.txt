DISCOVERIES (chronological):
1) Two novel kinds of blood-group active antigens discovered. 2) Proof that mitomycin C group A [STEA] stimulates lymphocyte viability in tissue culture.
2) First to show, experimentally, that antigen (D) is a glistening B-glycoprotein molecule complexed with a portion of an IgE molecule & possessing a special β-lytic affinity and ability to transfer to other cells; earlier than & independent of 3.
3) First to demonstrate, in vitro, synergistic action of insulin & cortisone: acceleration of deoxycorticosterone synthesis. 4) First to discover & characterize “blood-group T” antigen, a hitherto unknown human blood group antigen. 5) Discovery of the “blood-group Z” antigen. 6) Demonstration that certain tumors produce antibodies against their own surface antigens. 7) Discovery of a new class of antibody: "T-helper-associated antibody." 8) First to demonstrate that lymphocytes can be induced to synthesize interferon in vitro. 9) Discovery of a novel mechanism for the transfer of genetic information from cell to cell via extracellular RNA. 10) Demonstration that certain tumors produce antibodies against their own surface antigens. 11) Discovery of a new class of antibody: "T-helper-associated antibody." 12) First to demonstrate that lymphocytes can be induced to synthesize interferon in vitro. 13) Discovery of a novel mechanism for the transfer of genetic information from cell to cell via extracellular RNA.

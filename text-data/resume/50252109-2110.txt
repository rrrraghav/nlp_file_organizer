PERSONAL STATEMENT
I am a dedicated researcher with extensive experience in the field of thrombosis and hemostasis. My research has focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying thrombus formation and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders. I am committed to training the next generation of scientists and to advancing our understanding of this important area of biomedical science.

OBJECTIVES: To study the role of NF-KB in regulation of gene expression.
8/85-2/90: I studied the effects of various stimuli on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation and its subsequent effect on gene expression.
8/90-7/93: I investigated the role of NF-kB in TNF-induced signaling pathways.
7/93-pres.: I am currently studying the molecular mechanisms regulating NF-kB activation and function.

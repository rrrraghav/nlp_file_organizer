PERSONAL STATEMENT

I am an Associate Research Oncologist at Rhode Island Hospital and an Associate Professor of Medicine and Pathology at Brown University. My research is focused on the role of glycoconjugates in cancer biology. I have been working in this area for over 20 years, and I have made significant contributions to our understanding of how glycans influence tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion.

I am particularly interested in developing new therapies that target glycans on cancer cells. I believe that these therapies have the potential to be highly effective against a wide range of cancers.

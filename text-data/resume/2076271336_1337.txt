FACULTY BIOGRAPHIES

Mark A. McHugh

Dr. Mark A. McHugh joined the Department of Chemical Engineering
at the University of Notre Dame in January, 1981. His research interests
are directed toward experimental studies of high pressure fluid phase
behavior of mixtures. Currently three types of mixtures are being
studied: hydrocarbon solid-supercritical fluid (SCF) mixtures, solid
polymer-SCF mixtures, and polymer solution-SCF mixtures. Also, he is
investigating the possibility of using an SCF as a solvent media for
reacting mixtures. Prior to coming to Notre Dame, Dr. McHugh was at
FMC Corporation from May, 1975 to August, 1976, and then at the
University of Delaware from September, 1976, to January, 1981, where
he obtained his Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the area of high
pressure phase behavior.

Philip Davidson

Philip Davidson is Product Manager for the high-pressure equipment
(superpressure) product line of Newport Scientific, Inc. Mr. Davidson is a
longstanding member of the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), and recently became
a member of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). He is
presently chairman of the AIChE High Pressure Committee and also
serving on the ASTM Committees G-4 on the Compatibility and Sensitivity
of Materials in Oxygen-Enriched Atmospheres and T70.04 on Hydrogen
Embrittlement. He is co-editor of Chemical Engineering at Supercritical
Fluid Conditions published in 1983. Mr. Davidson holds a BS in Chemical
Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, and
has more than 25 years of experience in the engineering, application and
sale of high-pressure apparatus.

PERSONAL STATEMENT:

My research interests are in the area of coordination chemistry with emphasis on the synthesis and properties of platinum complexes. These complexes have been shown to be effective antitumor agents and I am interested in understanding the mechanism by which they exert their cytotoxic effects.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.
INTER - OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
100 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017

To: Mr. E.M. Schaaf Date: December 6, 1972
From: R.B. Seligman
Subject: Parliament History

Pursuant to our conversation, you will find attached several pages of a report issued by the Research Center concerned with major changes in the Parliament brand since the early 1960’s. Please check this information and let me know if there are errors or deficiencies.

As we noted in our conversation, interest is centered on changes which would be obvious to a consumer; for example, recess vs. no recess, changes in tipping length or filter construction, single vs. dual filters and length of filters.

Most important would be to supply information prior to 1961 which, I trust, will be in the Manufacturing Department’s files.

Finally, a reminder that I have a deadline of December 13 to have the information in my hands.

Jow:

It is difficult for me to
describe this account.

I am in favor of allowing
it to use the balance remaining
in this account as of June 30, 1975
for the purpose of a salary payment
& providing that we get a swallow
check 3/1 that we got a refund of
the amount paid prior.

The grant from April 6, 1975 to
March 31, 1975 was # 8544 - amount
$16,875.47 a letter $1,000 supplement.
School in ‘74, last no moved to the medical
school in ‘75. The balance of this grant
is applied to with the preparation, but
the medical of last called paid for refund
& we are not sure what is done.
ordered accounting by day. However, it
was a mistake & now we have to do it.
Discovery on our 31st and a new authority
to be able to use this money as April.

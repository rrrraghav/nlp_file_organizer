Topline data from the Yenkelovich study of the cigarette market
have been received.

There are three primary objectives of the study.

1. To form the best possible description of Behavior segments
of cigarette smokers

2. To measure the size of each segment

3. To obtain share of market data within each segment

Five distinct non-demographic segments in the market were isolated.
(The names given to the segments are, to a limited extent, self-
explanatory. A review of the previous report will provide a more
complete definition.)

The segments and their size are as follows:

% of All Smokers

Profiler Segment 41

Consciously Dependent-Unconcerned 24
Consciously Dependent-Concerned 13

Motor Segment 14

Susceptible 6

Unclassifiable 2

It will be noted that further analysis provided by this study
permitted a refinement of the segments reported earlier.

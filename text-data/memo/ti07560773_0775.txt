MEMORANDUM

TO: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.
FR: Peter G. Sparber

On April 15, Sorell Schwartz proposed an April-December 1987
budget for his program. The following week I requested
clarification of several points, and yesterday received a
satisfactory response from him.

Based on my examination of the scientific witness budget, actual
expenditures and projected costs*, I observe and recommend the
following:

o The hourly rates appear to be reasonable.

The hourly rates ($150 per hour) charged by Schwartz and
his colleagues compare favorably with rates charged by
our other consultants, and are $25-$50 less than is
charged their other clients.

The rates are calculated in roughly the same manner as
are those charged by legal counsel and public relations
agencies. The rate not only compensates the individual
scientists (about $73) & secretarial support, office space
and equipment.
*but also includes overhead.

o The overall nine-month budget may be reduced slightly.

According to Schwartz, a large portion of the
administrative hours shown in the budget cover the cost
of maintaining the scientists’ awareness of the status of
ETs science, conveying our criticisms of individual
performances, and weekly conferences with and reports to
institute staff and counsel.

Schwartz says that he has already reduced the
administrative budget below a realistic point. Apart
from arbitrarily reducing it by say, 10 per cent, there
does not appear to be one item that can be eliminated
or reduced.

However, there are items within the scientific budget
that can be eliminated or reduced. Participation in
scientific meeting ($26,000) might be eliminated; IAPAG
meetings might be reduced by $10,000.

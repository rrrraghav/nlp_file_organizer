MEMORANDUM October 10, 1978

TO : Dr. A. W. Spears

FROM : Dr. C. I. Lewis, c&p
        Director, Quality Control

SUBJECT: TCRC Analytical Methods Committee

I do not feel we should sit idly by and let this committee avoid solving the analytical problems that exist in our industry. As a professional chemist, I feel obligated to make a strong presentation at the next meeting to challenge this committee to make assignments that will lead to solutions to some of our analytical problems and give greater value to TCRC presentations.

I was able to sell them on the idea of the g.c. nicotine collaborative study and I believe we can sell them on the idea of making assignments in some other areas: if I have your support.

The attached list is potential areas of analytical concern. Please review the list and indicate a few of these or others which you feel we should get definite assignments. I will prepare myself and make a sell for these specific assignments.

From C. T. Guss
Assistant Controller - Financial Services

Sub PRODUCT PRICING/CONTRIBUTION

Messrs. D. S. Johnston, C. C. Kern, Jr., and T. P. Kriz have requested that one procedure be determined in establishing new product pricing or review of current brand contribution analyses. The following procedures are recommended:

Brand Contribution Analyses

Requests for actual brand/country financial information should be directed to either myself or Mike McCarthy (Supervisor, Forecasting and Planning).

Brand contribution projections involving only changes in volume, price assumptions, marketing spending, or use of existing manufactured cigarette leaf blends should be directed to me. Requests involving packaging, leaf blend or cigarette length changes on existing brands should follow procedures below on “New Product Pricing.”

Product Pricing/Cost

Projects involving new brands/styles, changes in existing brand packaging, leaf blend or cigarette length should be initially brought to my attention. The determination of pricing/cost for new customer export and contract manufacturing shipments should also follow these procedures.

Product Managers (Domestic, Export, Contract Manufacturing) should:

discuss packaging specifications and manufacturing concerns with Ron
Leisure (Manufacturing Manager - New Products);

discuss leaf blend (if new) with Dick Chumney, Jr., (Vice President -
Research) at R&QA;

discuss with me all volume, pricing, timing, and marketing assumptions to
be used in the pricing/contribution analyses.

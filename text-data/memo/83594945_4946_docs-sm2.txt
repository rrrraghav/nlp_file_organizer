Re: Test Methodology Panel - PM Slides

We understand that the companies generally are eager
to continue the work of the recently formed Test Methodology
Panel (“Panel”). To that end, enclosed are the slides from
PM’s presentation at the April 1, 1998 Panel meeting. The
presentation merely outlines one testing approach for possible
presentation to the government at some point in the future.
The presentation also may serve as an outline for a paper to
be published by the industry.

At its April 1st meeting, the Panel agreed that the
companies would evaluate PM’s presentation, then take the
following steps in preparation for another meeting to be held
in May 1998:

•	Determine the extent to which each company is willing
to share its testing approaches with other Panel
members or the members of the yet-to-be-formed expert
panel. Also consider how such presentations would be
made (e.g., written papers versus oral briefings).
These presentations presumably would be made at the
May 19th meeting.

•	Identify those assays that, in the opinion of each
company, are not appropriate for testing ingredients.

•	Provide thoughts regarding the composition and role of
the expert panel. Drs. Frawley and Squire, and
possibly Doull, already have been suggested as panel
members.

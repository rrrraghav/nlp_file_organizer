We are currently in the process of disposing of all obsolete records stored in Lancaster. In addition, arrangements will be made to dispose of obsolete records kept in the storage areas of Greensboro, Louisville, Danville, and New York. Until all of this is accomplished and an appropriate Records Center selected, it is important that no additional records be sent to Lancaster. Please make your people aware of this request. We will make every effort to make this transition period as short as possible.

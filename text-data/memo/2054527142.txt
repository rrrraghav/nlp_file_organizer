RE: Document Disposal Suspension Notice

Litigation has been filed which requires us to retain certain records, many, if not all, of which are already subject to Disposal Suspension under the Philip Morris Records Management Program. (Documents subject to Disposal Suspension are listed in Appendix A to the Records Management Manual). If you have not already done so, please make certain that disposal of all records relating to the nicotine content of tobacco, tobacco products (cigarettes, filler, reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, etc.) and cigarette smoke is suspended.

All records and other materials concerning these topics should be retained, regardless of media or type, whether in paper, electronic or other form and including, but not limited to, drafts, copies, handwritten notes, message slips, raw data, electronic data compilation, E-mail, and diaries. In addition, the recycling of computer backup tapes that contain any such information also should be suspended.

Please make certain you share this information with all those for whose records you have responsibility.

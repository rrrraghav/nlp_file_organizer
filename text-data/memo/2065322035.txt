PHILIP MORRIS CORPORATE SERVICES INC.
INTRA-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
WORLDWIDE REGULATORY AFFAIRS
ASIA / AUSTRALIA / JAPAN

To : Donald Harris / Roger Whidden Date : 9 December, 1997
From : Mark P. Friedman
Subject : THAILAND INGREDIENTS

I enclose for your information an article, dated May 30, 1995, which I found posted on the “Malaysian Drug and Poison Net” web site. Among other things, the article discusses ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes. Many of the ingredients specifically identified in this article are also discussed in the information paper that was presented to the Thai Cabinet in May 1996.

With best regards,

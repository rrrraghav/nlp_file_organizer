Subject: Remarks on Office Action on Helff. 582-518, PM #472

The bentonite in the present specification is not described
as "calcined" and is not intended to be, but is the naturally
occurring finely divided or substantially colloidal form.
Kauffman specifies and claims repeatedly calcined bentonite
as the carrier for medicaments or vaporizable smoke-treating
agents, and describes the calcined bentonite as having “few, if
any, of the distinguishing characteristics by which bentonites
are commonly identified and that it is a substantially different
substance from the starting or non-calcined bentonite," (pp. 3,
col. 2, ll. 4). The calcined product is said to be no longer
colloidal. The agglomeration which is responsible for this means
that the product would not have the characteristics itemized on
p. 7, l. 12, of the present specification, since there would be
considerable pores and fissures and the particles could absorb
nicotine (at least in the sense of taking the liquid into the
pores). The molded form of Kauffman would be even less applicable.

The calcined bentonite is said to be a selective adsorbent
for nicotine. This would make it unsuitable for choice as a
carrier intended to release nicotine to the smoke; that is, it
could hardly be characterized as a "weak adsorbent," by the
definition of our specification. As was remarked in regard to
the first Office Action, our requirement for weak adsorbents for
nicotine rules out those, as in Irby, et al., and Kauffman,
having a strong affinity for it. Because they do not teach the
use of weak adsorbents, those references do not, even when
taken with Bavley, et al., make obvious the present invention.

It is admittedly unfortunate that one or two of our weak
adsorbents (silica gel, zeolite) have the same name as adsorbents

MEMORANDUM

April 7, 1976

TO: George Telford

FROM: Larry DuLude

RE: TRUE “QUIT” CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

I have prepared the following analysis based on the Gallup and Robinson data for True "Quit" ad as tested to date, a total of 15 observations. The ads tested ran during May, 1975 and February, 1976, and included the original Tip-in test of the campaign. Although this analysis covers male smokers only, female data is also available if you find this type of report to be useful.

This memo will:

1) Track effectiveness over time, and 2) attempt to isolate the reasons for success or failure.

Listed below is a re-cap of each G & R observation of a True "Quit" ad. Also listed are average smoker scores for all cigarettes (including True) run in the test issues, and average smoker scores for all Super Hi-Fi brands (excluding True) run in the test issues.

Initial true scores were above the average for all cigarettes but fell below average in the third observation. The next 8 observations scored below average, while recent ads have scored much higher. However, the True "Quit" ad has consistently outperformed the average competitive Super Hi-Fi ads throughout the campaign.

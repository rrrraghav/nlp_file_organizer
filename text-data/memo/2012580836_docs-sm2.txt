From: Paul D. Smith
Subject:

Mr. Hetsko of American spoke to me Monday, August 3. He
advised that the company had taken a position with respect to the
Kolodny - Beatty luncheon matter.

I told him I did not know what he was talking about.

He explained Mr. Kolodny had asked for a luncheon meet-
ing which was attended by:

Messrs. Bartle of U. S. Tobacco
Bowling of Philip Morris
Judge of Lordillard
McAllister and Provost of
Mooney & Byers
Moneyett of American and
Wade of Reynolds.

He stated that no Brown & Williamson representative was present.

He stated that he was calling all companies to tell them
that American’s position was that they would go along with the pro-
posal subject to conditions as follows:

1. All of the other principal manufacturers
(six companies) agreed.

2. Everything was approved by the General
Counsel of each of the six companies.

I asked him how we, the General Counsel, would know what
was being done. He said that he had no answer.

I iterated that I knew nothing of the matter. I further
stated that you and I would not be able to talk until this week.

I gathered that there is some proposal, in writing, which
was distributed at the luncheon.



Paul D. Smith

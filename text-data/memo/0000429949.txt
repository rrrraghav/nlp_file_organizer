SUBJECT: SENSORY EVALUATION OF ALUMINUM SULFATE ON DRY TOBACCO

Results from Panel have subsequently compared two BRACLET CS
blends containing varying levels of aluminum sulfate to a control
blend contaning 153-117 tobacco treated with 3% aluminum sulfate.
The panel found the blends containing aluminum sulfate to be less harsh
under scrutiny. Specifically, this additive reduces the amount of
tobacco flavor and provides a smoother sensation. A slight
smoothing of irritation was noted.

Subject: CIGARETTES FOR ANALYTICAL SIDESTREAM RESEARCH

Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical Research, and Cigarette technology personnel, several cigarette models were designed specifically for research on sidestream smoke composition. The objective for the upcoming studies is to investigate the effect of cigarette circumference and MG (OH)2 wrapper. In order to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes were made at three different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24.8 mm) each with a standard commercial wrapper (Kimberly-Clark 156) and with an MG (OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from the same batch of tobacco in a nonfiltered 100 mm filtered configuration.

The selected blend was the current project TRIM blend with standard production components. DBC Bright, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RUTC and RD 150B was used. It contained no stems or expanded tobaccos, so that better looking ultra slim cigarettes could be produced. All samples had the same casing and cut-out system.

The Hauni lab mix was used for all three circumferences. Cellulose acetate filters were made with widths varying officiencies in an effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries within reasonable levels. The tables attached to this memo give analytical data for each of the models. As can be seen in Table 1, the 17 mm configuration gave extremely high RTD’s for nonfiltered cigarettes. This could have an effect on mainstream puffing to a greater extent than for an standard circumference cigarette. Ultra slim prototypes typically have RTD's above 6° water for 45 - 55 filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for the slim cigarettes.

Tables II and III give the calculated differences in data for each circumstance with the commercial and the low sidestream wrappers at standard circumference as controls.

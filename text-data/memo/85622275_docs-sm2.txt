MEMORANDUM

TO: State Activities Policy Committee

Mr. K.V.R. Dey, Jr. Arthur J. Stevens, Esquire,
Ernest Pepples, Esquire Mr. Charles A. Tucker
Mr. Shepard P. Pollack

FROM: John D. Kelly X

For your information the attached memorandum from Minneapolis
City Attorney examines the constitutional arguments made by
our attorneys in opposition to an amendment expanding the
Minneapolis sampling ordinance. Unfortunately city attorneys
in other cities have taken a different view. Happily the city
attorney’s memorandum has caused Alderman Dziedzic to withdraw
his amendment.

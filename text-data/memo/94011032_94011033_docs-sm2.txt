MEMORANDUM

TO: The Members of the Executive Committee

FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

Administrative Law Judge Vitonne yesterday presided over the opening day of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) scheduled week hearings on the proposed indoor air quality standard. OSHA staff testified in the morning; the balance of the day was consumed by a cross-examination period.

Dr. Michael Silverstein, OSHA's director of policy, expressed the Agency’s intent to use the information obtained at the hearing to “ensure that the final rule is effective.” Noting that ETS issues had received a disproportionate amount of pre-hearing attention, Silverstein stressed that tobacco is only one of many airborne "hazards" OSHA would address in the final rule. He denied any political motivation for the rulemaking.

John Martonik, acting director of health standards programs for OSHA, stressed that the regulation would not ban smoking, but only restrict smoking to separately exhausted smoking areas under negative pressure so that non-smokers are “protected” from the adverse health effects of ETS. Martonik estimated that 4.4 million buildings and 70.7 million workers would be affected by the rule. Compliance with the IAQ standard is estimated at $8.1 billion.

Following the opening statements, nearly a dozen individuals acknowledged their intent to cross-examine OSHA staffers. The questions primarily from tobacco industry representatives, sought to clarify matters raised from the scope of the action to the research the Agency cited to support the proposed rule. Following one lengthy exchange, Agency staffers stated that the rule ban was written does not preempt state and local laws banning/restricting smoking.

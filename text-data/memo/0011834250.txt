SUBJECT: BETA INTERNAL SAMPLES/267

To take advantage of available tobaccos from the STETSON and AMELIA
CPT products, plan to make ten BETA internal samples in Macon. These
samples will permit assessments of additional blends and designs as
potential BETA candidates, as well as allow us more experience running
the BETA fabrication equipment.

Tobaccos we will be using are: STETSON XLF-662T with XFP-357, XFP-375
and unflavored, and AMELIA XLF-680G unflavored. It is imperative that
the unflavored tobaccos be well blended.

Two filters will be required, 3.3 x 15,000 @ 16" p.d. and 4.3 x 37,000
@ 12.4” p.d. Both will use 65HL plug wrap. Three cigarette papers
will be required, E-753 (or S-521), S-609, and S-656. Laser perfor-
ated tipping has been ordered and should arrive in Macon within the
next few days. Please see that all materials will be available in
Macon by March 25.

The official program for the opening of the Philip Morris Europe/Marlboro-sponsored
exhibition, “The Far West”, is as follows:

11.00 a.m. Press conference held by Dr. L. Wijsenbeek, Director of the HG.
12.00 – approx. VIP Opening Reception in auditorium of the H.G. for
1.30 p.m. approximately 250 invited guests.

1. De Wijsenbeek will introduce the exhibition.
2. Dr. Chris van Dam, Museum of Education, will give a
historical explanation of the exhibition.
3. M. Kingdon Gould, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to the
Netherlands will officially open the exhibition.
4. Guests will tour the exhibition.
5. Guests will be offered drinks and snacks by the Burgomaster
of The Hague.

B. de Vries (PM Holland) informed me late yesterday that he mailed invitations to the
opening reception, on March 2 to the attached list prepared by PM Holland. The
official invitation from the Burgomaster was accompanied by a PMH letter (see
attachment).

I also discussed with Mr. de Vries his possibility that you would attend the opening.
Before officially asking you to attend, Mr. de Vries would like to review the
situation with Leo Lentz so unnecessary demands are not made on your time. It is
my understanding that Dr. Lentz is scheduled to meet with you on 9 March and
will discuss it with you at that time.

I will keep you informed.

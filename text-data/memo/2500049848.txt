PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017

TO: James Charles DATE: May 5, 1986

FROM: Lee Pollak

SUBJECT: Cigarette Ingredients

In anticipation that the cigarette ingredients list filed
with the DHHS might become public and receive publicity in
Europe, we submitted the March 27 Covington & Burling
memorandum on public relations strategy to Helmut Gaisch for
his review.

We specifically requested his review of the questions and
answers, suggesting that, if appropriate, he reword the
answers so that they might be more appropriate in the
European environment. We also asked that he prepare
additional answers for questions that might be raised in
Europe.

I have attached his proposed answers and I would be
interested in your comments. After we have a chance to talk
about this in general, it then may be appropriate for you to
discuss the questions and answers in detail with Helmut.

Obviously, in Europe, the issue will be looked at somewhat
differently both because the regulations there are different
and because many of the products are made with fewer, or
without, ingredients. At the same time, our posture in
Europe must be completely consistent with the approach that
we are taking here in the States.

I am sending this to you because you worked with C and B and
others in preparing the proposed U.S. response.

I look forward to hearing from you.

W. D. Daniels to J. P. Feigh:
The Garden State Milk Store chain in Hawthorne, N.J., last week set up its first display of Philip Morris cigarettes. It is a very attractive display and the store personnel are doing an excellent job of merchandising. The top row holds 16 cartons; second row 12 cartons; third row 8 cartons; fourth row 4 cartons holding a total of 40 packages. (Picture to Mr. Stone, Mr. Simmons (1) and Mr. Christensen (1).)

J. R. Johnson - L.B. Kansas City:
In British C.S., we made an offer to purchase the cigarette Division of L&M; deal is off due to price. Details will be available. This into from a good source.

G. W. Miller to J. P. Feigh:
Philip Morris is offering to customers a complete breakdown on all merchandising aids. (This booklet gives a good summary of all Philip Morris wrappers, floor and counter displays, etc., for the benefit of our retail men.) - (J.A.)

J. B. Lewman to J. P. Feigh:
“Now we compare sales with a year ago.” These audits were very stupid selling men are not aware of what they are doing. It is imperative that it should be mandatory that a vendor give complete store front for each location. We have been working on this for some time and I believe the results will justify the effort. (Picture to Mr. Stone, Mr. Simmons (1) and Mr. Christensen (1).)

P. A. Elder to J. P. Feigh:
I am very happy with the progress we are making in our merchandising program. We have a lot of good men working for us.

J. L. Henderson to J. P. Feigh:
(A man and boy at a counter) There is a new display at Johnson’s Store in Auburn, N.Y. A very attractive display.

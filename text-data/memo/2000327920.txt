INTER - OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

To: Mark Van Maisen Date: January 8, 1988

From: D. L. Faustini

Subject: Ageless® (iron oxide) Update

Enclosed please find copies of the transparencies used for the Ageless®
(iron oxide) presentation which was given in November, 1987. At the meeting
R&D agreed to continue to gather data on the insert atmosphere system so that
we may pursue APHIS approval and to investigate simultaneously, iron oxide
as an alternative method for treating export tobacco. In review, I would
like to mention that R&D Entomology has just completed a draft proposal on
the use of Ageless®. Upon approval of this document studies will be under-
taken to evaluate iron oxide as a control tool for the cigarette beetle,
Lasioderma serricorne. When these studies are complete we will review the
benefit of this form of treatment, and thus be in a better position to make
a recommendation for implementation.

If I may be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.

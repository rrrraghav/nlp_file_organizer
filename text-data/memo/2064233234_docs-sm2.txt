PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A.

INTER - OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

To: Dr. C. L. Ellis Date: November 21, 1997
From: A. I. Goldsmlth

Subject: Specific examples of overseas research

Attached you will find a table of American companies and foreign countries in which they have research and development facilities (as of Nov. 17). The information comes from the D&B - INTERNATIONAL DUN’S MARKET IDENTIFIERS (DIALOG File 518) database, and the particular locations were identified by selecting entries whose primary or secondary Standard Industrial Classification Code is included: 8731 (Commercial physical research), 8732 (Industrial nonphysical research), or 8733 (Noncommercial research organization), with an ultimate parent company in United States. The tabular format was chosen since it is a convenient method of answering the specific question of where U.S. companies conduct research. It should be noted that D&B’s street uses to define and index locations keep certain facilities off the list; for instance, the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory is not found in this particular database. However, the appearance of Philip Morris in the list demonstrates that this strategy is valid for obtaining comparative examples. If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to call me at ext. 5352.

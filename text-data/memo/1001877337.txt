Subject: Evaluation of #1556 Filter Plugs (RBS #927)

Filters from cigarettes coded 1556 were evaluated by the synthetic mixture - IR technique. The results of these evaluations show that these filter plugs are quite comparable in activity with the M-12 and 1010 filter plugs evaluated previously. The average gas phase reductions for these three samples are given in the following table.

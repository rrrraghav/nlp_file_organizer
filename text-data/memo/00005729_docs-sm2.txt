MEMORANDUM

TO: Committee of Counsel
FROM: Fred Panzer

Horace has asked me to send you the attached copy of the Kennedy Bill
as marked up yesterday, August 17, by his Subcommittee on Health and
Scientific Research.

It was unanimously approved and will go to the full committee where
its chances are equally favorable.

Note the bill number has been changed from 3115 to 3116. Eliminated
are all of those elements of Title IV dealing with smoking which would
require sequential referral to other Senate committees. These omissions
include the “toxic unit tax”, the restriction of smoking in government
buildings and the “Swedish style” multiple warnings. What remains is
the deterrent of smoking among children and the section that calls for
an HEW study of tobacco smoke and additives. The section that deals
with tobacco is now Title III, beginning on page 28.

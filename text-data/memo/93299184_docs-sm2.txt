MEMORANDUM

September 2, 1993

TO: J. Tamburello

FROM: G. Telford

RE: OVERNIGHT SHIPMENT OF HARLEY-DAVIDSON CARTON-ENDS

--------------------------------------------------
This authorizes the overnight shipment to shipping point 410 of 200 sheets of Harley-Davidson carton-ends in the following quantities:

 - Lofi Kings 100 sheets
 - Lofi Box 50 sheets
 - Lights 50 sheets

Carton ends will arrive at the warehouse on 9/1 and should be shipped on 9/2.

The request comes from the Cleveland Division manager handling a key account in the Pittsburgh Test Market. The Giant/Eagle account has asked for the Low Price carton flags to be removed from Harley-Davidson cartons, to avoid confusion at retail now that the product is sold at the "new standard price".

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

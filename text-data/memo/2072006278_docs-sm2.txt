MEMORANDUM

TO: Brendan McCormick, Philip Morris USA
FROM: Hinda Mitchell, Cochran Public Relations
RE: WCTU Study
DATE: April 2, 1997

Remember a long time ago when I was going to send this to you? Lo and behold, here it is.

I think you’ll see some very interesting information in here. I found it fascinating and the comparisons are evident.

Of particular note is the fact that the information was compiled from the Anti-Saloon League Museum right here in Westerville – a suburb of Columbus. Also, Oberlin College in northern Ohio maintains a comprehensive collection of historical documents related to the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.

As I mentioned, David Laufer and Chan had discussed this angle for possible media activity a while back and that's when Jim Underwood (who works for us as a researcher for projects) initially began his search.

Please review and let me know your thoughts. I still think this has excellent story potential on a local and national basis.

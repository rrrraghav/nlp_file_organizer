As discussed with you yesterday on the telephone, we would like to have
two cartons of the new Bravo cigarettes made with lettuce and supposedly
improved in taste. Also I requested that you send us some Benson cig-
arettes made by Rothman’s in Canada. We would like to have five cartons
of these. I also requested several additional cartons of Select cigars
that are made in Europe and understand that these have been
shipped from Europe and should be in the laboratory toward the end of
this week.

An afterthought, Mr. Dugan also had said that he would send some Benson
cigarettes to the laboratory. You might check with him to see if he
has already ordered these cigarettes.

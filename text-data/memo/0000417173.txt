SUBJECT:  “Turkey” Production – Preliminary Report

We have materially curtailed the volume of “Turkey” in connection
with our recent survey and are now submitting a preliminary report
on the production of “Turkey” in the area.

The major goal of this work was to determine the effects of the various
practices on produce quality.  A detailed study of the effect of
different methods of feeding, housing, and care has been made. We made
only limited observations as to the cost of production.

The following producers are listed below, specifications and equipment
are omitted:

153061 “Bureaus” Burley, "Turkey" Turkish, 91271)
153062 “Bureaus” Burley, "Turkey" Turkish, 91271)
153063 “Bureaus” Burley, "Turkey" Turkish, 91271)
153064 “Bureaus” Burley, "Turkey" Turkish, 91271)

All of the samples are from the area of  S. E.  and the practices and
equipment used were generally similar. The basic produce
is from the same source and is of a uniform quality.  The feed
used was primarily corn and oats, with some bran added.  The turkeys
were housed in pens and given access to pasture. In the process of production, Affiliates
are made to the “Turkey” by hand.

Following is a detailed listing of the producers who are involved in
the operation: A. L. Smith, 10 acres; J. W.  Smith, 10 acres; and
W. H. Smith, 10 acres.

Subject: Virginia Slims Filter and Menthol – Female Sampling Program

Virginia Slims, the first cigarette designed exclusively for women, responded exceedingly well to special sampling activities in the
San Francisco test market area. As a result, we have decided to include
female samplers as a part of the national introduction of this exciting
new brand. Cities and number of samplers for your Region are as follows:

CITY NUMBER SAMPLERS
Philadelphia 5
Washington, D.C. 3
Pittsburgh 2
Cleveland 2
Baltimore 2
Cincinnati 1

These samplers will carry out a comprehensive, high-quality person-to-person sampling effort beginning Monday, October 14, and concluding
Friday, November 22.

Recruitment

Begin immediately to recruit female samplers for the indicated cities.
Those employed should be slightly above average height, slender, attractive,
well groomed, and good conversationalists, preferably with modeling exper-
ience. They will be representing Virginia Slims, a product that has elegance
and style. Their personalities should reflect these features as well.

Salaries for female samplers will be $150 per week, plus expenses of 10c
per mile for the use of her personal car. Due to the nature of the job,
samplers must have automobiles. The salary offered for these samplers
is designed to permit you to be highly selective when recruiting and inter-
viewing applicants. These girls may be recruited from any source that you
find convenient. Please avoid hiring directly through modeling or employ-
ment agencies, since the girl’s total salary of $150 per week would be
reduced significantly. Use model agency for leads only.

each sampler:

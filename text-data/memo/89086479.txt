TO: Mr. P. R. Great, Vice President, General Counsel

FROM: Mr. W. D. Obarson

SUBJECT: Patent, Alfred Andreas, Application No. 667955

I have read over the above application which you forwarded
to me and find that in many respects it resembles the air filtration
system we use on TRUE cigarettes and which is also used on Carlton
cigarettes.

The big drawback to Mr. Andreas’ solid segment with channels
is the difficulty of manufacturing such a segment. This would have to
be molded in two pieces, possibly even three. Our past experience with
this type apparatus indicates that the cost is prohibitive, plus the
fact that the filtering efficiency is no better than can be obtained
with normal filters.

I, of course, would not expect you to use all these reasons
in your answer to the gentleman, but wanted to give you some of the
background for my opinion that this is of no value.

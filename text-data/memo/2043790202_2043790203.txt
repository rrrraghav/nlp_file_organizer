C. E. Evarkiou, San Diego Section

ORIGINAL ARIZONA TEST MARKET

Five weeks into retail intro. Players shows strong movement with outstanding trial and repeat sales... Retail audits indicate 1.75 - 2.0% share of market, split evenly between 85’s and 100’s… Retailers extremely receptive with none of usual objections regarding increased inventory to accommodate two new brand packings... Immediate positive consumer response... Trial exceptional in convenience stores where Players featured in permanent up-front Plan B location; well above that of previous new brand intros. High percentage of trial coming from 25-30 year olds, with about half of business coming from PM brands (Marlboro Red Lights, 100’s and various B&H 100’s packings)... Retail distribution about 9% for both 85’s and 100’s... Visibility and depth of inventory excellent, with few out-of-stocks encountered… Retailers reordering on regular basis.

SAN DIEGO EXPANSION MARKET

After two weeks of retail coverage, results comparable to same stage of Arizona intro.

ENTIRE SECTION – MANAGEMENT SELL-IN

Two weeks prior to national intro., sell-in going smoothly...

SEQUENTIAL PROGRAM

Tower Displays (Arizona and San Diego). Emptied out in one to two days… lasted less than a day in many high volume outlets... appearance and stability very good - no problem encountered.

Two for one Displays (Arizona). Encountered excellent response from both retailers and consumers... Several reports from sales force indicated 48-unit display somewhat flimsy in view of number of packings it needs to support.

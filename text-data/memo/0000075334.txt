SUBJECT: POTENTIAL PROCESS MODIFICATIONS/599

In order to assist us in the development of new products, we need to obtain an estimate of the impact that various process modifications may have on the Macon plant. New process and product technology is developing in several areas including the use of a CTO process, implementation of additives to tobacco, development of a longer lasting cigarette, new blends and materials which are more brand specific. These projects span the entire range from new product developments to needed improvements on current brands. Our needs in these areas are obviously immediate from an overall corporate viewpoint. However, we also recognize the realities of the impacts changes to our process and materials will have in manufacturing.

What we need then is an ability to rationalize these objectives and short term constraints. In order to accomplish this rationalization, we will need your input from the viewpoint of the degree of difficulty of implementation.

More specifically, we need estimates for each of our considered modifications addressing items such as cost, timing, degree of difficulty, resource needs, etc. We can then utilize this data to both guide our development efforts as well as reconcile any differences in time frames and priorities.

A list of some of the modifications we are currently considering is attached. Relative to the information we need, we are not looking for "to-the-penny" estimates. A quicker response is more important than a fine-tuned estimate. At the same time, recognize that our programs will be impacted and a degree of accuracy is essential.

FROM: Marketing Information & Analysis/Deborah Potter

SUBJECT: Next De-Nic Tampa (10/07)

Summary

Retail audit data estimate overall market share to be
0.9 for weeks 17-20.

Comparing De-Nic in Tampa with the earlier De-Nic
markets, retail audit share is still somewhat higher
than in the four original test markets.

Though in-store retail promotion was negligible,
current shares are supported by direct mail offers: a
free carton and two free packs.

Likely as a result of these coupon offers, shares in
carton stores improved. At the same time, shares in
pack outlets continued to decline.

Overall market distribution is 73% reflecting an
increase of +1% compared to the previous period. This
increase is largely due to a decline in outlets with
previously reported temporary OOS conditions.

Recent data indicate Next De-Nic Kings have been
declining at a more rapid rate while the 100’s are
demonstrating some degree of stability.

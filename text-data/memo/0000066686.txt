SUBJECT: BRAND SUMMARY OF DUPONT PANELISTS/311

I have attached a brand-by-brand tally of usable (21-59 years old)
Dupont panelists. This information was from early June.

The system is consistently updated with brand changes of current
panelists. Recently, 200 panelists per month have been added to the
system.

Another tally will be available late-September.

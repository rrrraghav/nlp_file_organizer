SUBJECT: ARJAY G-13 MEETING ON FREON

Present from Philip Morris:

H. Wakeham

R. D. Carpenter
W. G. Lloyd

Four people from R. J. Reynolds Company visited us to discuss the question of Freon residues in their expanded tobacco products:

Mr. Hayward Smith, representing ARJAY Company
Dr. Murray Senkus, Director of Research for
R.J. Reynolds
Dr. Allan Rodgman, Manager of Tobacco Chemistry
Research
Mr. Grant Stewart, in charge of G-13 Process Develop-
ment, one of the original patent holders

Dr. Rodgman made a very extensive presentation of their literature and experimental studies on Freon 11. He reviewed the literature with respect to toxic effects, threshold limit values as related to continuous exposure, and showed that the existing tolerance levels of 1,000 ppm for continuous exposure are far below the 50,000 ppm levels at which observable toxic effects begin. He stated that the maximum levels of Freon in 100% expanded tobacco product in the package would be below 5 micrograms/cigarette, and showed that converting this to smoke at the 18% transfer level would give safety factors of several thousand. Cigarettes packaged with higher levels of Freon very rapidly lose their excess Freon to below the 5 micrograms/cigarette level. The 5 microgram/cigarette value is to be compared with the regulation tolerance of exposure for an eight-hour day, or a total of 16 grams.

After this review Dr. Rodgman reported in detail on five experimental studies in their own laboratory and on contract to outside laboratories on the following topics:

Study No. 1 - Material balance of Freon in the cigarette and in the smoke;

Study No. 2 - Determination of acute respiratory toxicity effects by
means of the R.J. Reynolds inhalation machine;

PRIVATE MEMO

FILAMENT WELDED FIBER TEST
208-135-147
June 1975



Background

The possibility considered was produced tensile loads on Vertilex, Politex,
and Fiberite. The consideration of these materials were based on the belief
that they would provide a more homogeneous material. 
It was also felt that if the materials could be welded together, it
would be possible to produce a composite structure with improved properties.

The complete test setup was authorized to determine the relative
strength of Vertilex, Politex, and Fiberite. The results of this test
will be compared with those obtained from experimental composites.

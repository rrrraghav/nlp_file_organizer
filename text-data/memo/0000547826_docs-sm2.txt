RALCO’s overall creative strategy is to establish a positive awareness
of our product and brand name within the target market. Our media
strategy has been to concentrate on publications that reach our prime
targeted prospects by allocating budget to those publications and needs this than
to spread it thinly across many others. We have also allocated funds for 40 screen billboards.
RALCO’s 1978 plans we instructed the agency to wait on activating
the “American Heritage” campaign until we could determine if the "Home of the
Americana" campaign could be successfully promoted to 30 markets in the exclusive
territory. We have been advised that this is not possible and with your concurrence we will proceed to implement this portion of our plan, paying
to begin on January 1st, 1979.

The copy we plan to use is the same as that reviewed with you during your
RALCO orientation. Several many plans were presented in the morning but, Although
the “Barber” execution is the best result to date.

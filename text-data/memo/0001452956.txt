SUBJECT: SALEM LIGHTS - JAPAN

The attached note was pulled from our "greens" circulation and refers to product development of SALEM Lights for Japan. In particular, reference
was made to the desirability of a 100 mm – 20’s Slim Box and an 84 mm –
10’s Box for this product.

Our present Project Design parameters for the transfer of Export to Macon
do not include packaging equipment for either of these two styles.
Consequently, should you desire to pursue these two products, it is
important that we know as early as possible.

MEMORANDUM

TO: C. E. SMOOT

FROM: D. E. SPANGLER

DATE: August 17, 1979

SUBJECT: Lites/Brigade

Charlie, I apologize for the time it has taken me to get back on
Ray Allen’s suggestions for Lites and Brigade as potential new
brand entries.

We easily found that Philip Morris had us blocked from using
Brigade as a brand. It took us longer to determine that there
are three different "Lites" variations which would block our
usage as a brand name.

Although the brands cannot be used, I have asked one of the
creative groups to determine if the Lites concept makes sense
from a creative standpoint using a brand that has rub-off value.
If this has merit, I’ll let you know.

DATE: December 4, 1978

SUBJECT: BELAIR Coupon Safety Feature

Jerry, as you are already aware, the DELAIR Brand Group is investigating alternatives to the existing B&W coupon. One of these candidates does not incorporate a safety feature.

During the development of this creative, I have checked with a variety of people/departments to ensure that the elimination of the safety feature is acceptable to the Corporation. I think that I have been in contact with all responsible departments, but would like to double check.

Jerry, would you please send me a list of the people/departments that I should contact to obtain agreement to the possibility of dropping the coupon safety feature. I will combine your recommendations with my list.

I will keep you posted of the status of this project.

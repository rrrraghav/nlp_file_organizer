Subject: BASIC

Attached is a strategy statement for this product proposition, taking into account where the brand is in the USA.

Given that you have not yet had a packaging brief, I think the section entitled "Application to Europe" will give you a reasonable feel for what the packaging should or shouldn't include.

Could we discuss this upon your return.

Regards,

John Hogan

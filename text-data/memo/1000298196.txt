We are having a lot of trouble with your friend, Hickey, in obtaining
from him a manuscript useful in our volume on the proceedings from
the St. Maarten conference. Here is an example of Mr. Hickey’s
latest revision. It wanders all over the biological map with all kinds
of innuendos and hypotheses. Much of the material is irrelevant to
the conclusions. It is taken for granted that an author like Hickey has
read the literature, and it is not necessary for him to spend 15 pages
demonstrating this point.

Our problem is to get him to write a paper half the length of this one,
leading to the hypotheses stated in his conclusion. I don’t know how
we can accomplish this without sitting down with him at an "in camera"
session and rewriting the paper on the spot.

This man's meandering is holding up the volume. It may be that is what
some people want; namely, that it should be held up so long it will never
be published but, if the industry is to get any return on its investment in
this conference, we’d better get this book published.

Do you have any ideas for the solution of this problem?

Regards.

H.Wake

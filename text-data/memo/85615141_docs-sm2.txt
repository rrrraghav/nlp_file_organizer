OFFICE OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SALES

June 1, 1961

TO: All Field Sales Personnel
FROM: R. H. Orcutt
SUBJECT: SAMPLING

As you know, Lorillard sampling is conducted in accordance with a standard procedure calculated to promote our products and to avoid distribution to those under 21; distribution within three blocks of schools, playgrounds or other places of youthful activity; distribution within three blocks of any state, county or city legislative building; distribution to those in motor vehicles; distribution which blocks pedestrian traffic; or distribution which generates litter.

Lorillard and all of the other major cigarette manufacturers have recently agreed to conform their sampling to a uniform sampling Code (see attached) which contains most of the elements of the Lorillard procedure. This has been done in order to avoid legislation which might terminate our right to sample.

If it should come to your attention that any sampling of Lorillard or of competitive products does not conform to the code, we will appreciate being advised. Please direct your information to Mr. Joseph Tatulli of our Sales Promotion Department in the New York Office.

Subject: Gas Phase Comparison Analyses of Reduced Sidestream
1379-91 100mm Filter Cigarettes to Old Gold 100mm Filter

Introduction

A carton of each Sample and Control was submitted by Product
Development for gas phase analyzer. All samples were conditioned
for 42 hours in the Smoking Lab conditioning room and weight
selected by the Smoking Lab prior to analysis.

Four cigarettes from each group were then selected and analyzed
using a Bowman smoking machine coupled directly to a Varian
3600 GC. A Cambridge pad on the smoking machine removes the
particulate matter from the puff smoke passing only the gas phase
to the gas chromatograph. Whole puffs to the sample puff are
vented. The sample puff selected is taken on the next puff after
the burn line has passed a point 35mm from the tipping paper.

The gas phase column effluent is split into two detectors. The
NPD detector is most selective to organic compounds containing
nitrogen and the total area relates to the total concentration of
all these compounds detected in the gas phase. The other detector
is a FID which detects most organic compounds and the total FID
area relates to the total concentration of all these compounds.
Experimental conditions are presented in Table 1.

Reduced Sidestream 1379-91 100mm Filter Cigarette

1379-91 100mm filter cigarettes with reduced sidestream were
tested as compared to Old Gold filter controls. Table 3
exhibits the areas and area percents of selected compounds in the
Old Gold control and the means for four analyses. Table 4
reports the same selected compound data for the 1379-91 reduced
sidestream cigarettes and the mean of the four analyses. The last

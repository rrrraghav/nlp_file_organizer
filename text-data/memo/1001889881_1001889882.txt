Subject: Final Report - No Flavor "A" Commander Test
 Project 331 - Commander with Flavor "A" vs
 332 - Commander without Flavor "A"
 Preliminary issued February 4

CONFIDENTIAL

A sample of Commander smokers and a sample of non filter smokers tested
Commander cigarettes made with and without a substance known to us as Flavor “A”.
Laboratory analysis showed that the #331 cigarette contained about 53 micrograms
of Flavor “A”, delivered about 5% less TPM and about 6% less nicotine, with
a 0.3” harder draw. In effect, the two blends were equal, except that one had
flavor "A" while the other did not.

RESULTS

1. Among Commander smokers, the preference vote was 53% for Flavor “A”
47% for no “A”, which was not a significant difference. Among the other
non filter brand smokers, the preference was 30% = 30%.

2. The full reports give an indication of a possible difference in taste
which was not reported in our preliminary examination of data from this
test. The differences are not novel, clear cut and they do not appear
to have affected the over-all preference votes.

DATA

The preference votes of 53% for Flavor “A” among Commander smokers and
50% for Flavor "A" among other non filter smokers was not significant. The 21
point rating scale which ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) showed equal ratings
of 52 points for both cigarettes among smokers of non filter brands in general.
Commander smokers rated the cigarettes 59 to 55 in favor of Flavor “A”.

We always ask smokers to give the one word that describes the taste
of the test brand. Both groups of smokers indicated more votes for "sweet"
attributed to the cigarette with Flavor “A”, and more votes for "bitter" among
smokers associated with the cigarette without Flavor “A”. This was significant being
Commander smokers.

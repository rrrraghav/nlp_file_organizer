RE: Document Disposal Suspension Notice

As previously advised, litigation has been filed which requires us to retain certain records, most of all which are already subject to disposal suspension under the Philip Morris Records Management Program. (Documents subject to disposal suspension are identified in the Appendix entitled “Topics Subject to Disposal Suspension” to the Records Management Manual and in prior disposal suspension notices). The two most recent disposal suspension notices dealt with retaining their original form-regardless of the medium, including electronic mail—documents relating to (1) the manufacturing, testing and composition of tobacco products, paper, filter or any other material contained in, relating to or used in the manufacture testing and composition of tobacco products or (2) the nicotine content of tobacco, tobacco products [cigarettes, filler, reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, etc.] and cigarette smoke.

Philip Morris International should retain records relating to (1) and (2) above only as they relate to tobacco products intended for sale in the United States. This limitation does not apply, however, to records subject to the Appendix entitled “Topics Subject to Disposal Suspension.”

This notice is a reminder that E-Mail and other electronic documents in the categories referred to above must be retained. Although usual retention practice for electronic records subject to the Appendix entitled "Topics Subject to Disposal Suspension" has been to print and retain a paper copy, please ensure that a copy is also retained in electronic form. Retain “on line” all E-Mail messages that fall within the above categories. If you have any questions about how to retain E-Mail electronically, please consult your Information Systems Department.

MEMORANDUM

Strategy Letter: Maverick 3rd Quarter 1999 Workplan Materials
Program #: 99-003M

Objective: Provide targeted impactful point-of-sale materials that support Maverick’s 1999 creative campaign.

Maverick's “Real Deal” creative campaign will continue for 3rd Quarter workplan materials.

Overall Strategy: Provide a consistent and cohesive family appearance to all workplan point-of-sale pieces that are placed both in and outside the store. As we begin to build Maverick’s long-term brand identity, all workplan pieces will feature Maverick's signature Black and Gold colors via:

•	Black backgrounds instead of a combination of black and grey backgrounds.
•	Maverick’s gold signature icon (either “Maverick” brand name alone or coupled with the triangular logo and falcon).

Where room permits, "The Real Deal" headline will be used. The supporting tagline, “Real Taste, Great Deal”, however, will no longer be used. When this tagline was previous quarters' workplans, it connoted mostly a price or value positioning. Without using the tagline, however, allows consumers to draw their own conclusions about the brand, like a great quality product or ‘a brand of cigarettes that’s for me”.

Additionally, photos of Maverick packs will be featured on all pieces that are intended for placement away from the display (i.e., 2x2 panel holders) to help confirm that Maverick is a brand of cigarettes.

Tactics:

•	All old quarterly workplan pieces must be removed and replaced with new 3rd quarter workplan materials.

•	The 4, 6 and 8-wide riser strips that incorporate pricing areas must be used in conjunction with all 4, 6 and 8-wide riser cards.

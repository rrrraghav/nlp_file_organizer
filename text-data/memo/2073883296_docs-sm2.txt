PHILIP MORRIS MANAGEMENT CORP. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

TO: Distribution CF
DATE: July 17, 1998
FROM: Colleen O. Flinn
SUBJECT: The Am Law 100

The American Lawyer has published its Am Law 100 which lists the
financial information for the top 100 firms in the country. I thought you
might be interested in how some of our major firms fared last year
according to the survey; attached is a chart outlining the profits per partner.
If anyone is interested in the survey in its entirety, I have a copy in my
office.

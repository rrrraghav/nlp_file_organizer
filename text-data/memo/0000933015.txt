This is to confirm our discussion concerning these TRAMPS 110's giveaway items for use in the Oklahoma City Region.

B&W salesmen will hold set sales in retail outlets which normally sell cigarettes by cartons. Either a Bike Flag, Tote Bag, or Frisbee will be given to the consumer with the purchase of a carton of TRAMPS cigarettes. Any remaining quantities of items remaining at the end of the sale period will be left with the retailer in a box which will have a poster advising the consumer of the offer.

Book matches will be left in retail outlets for giveaway as the salesmen make their normal calls.

Should you have any further questions on the above, please let me know.

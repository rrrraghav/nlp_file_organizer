from: F. Resnik
Subject: Conversation with Ted Briskin - Sutton Research Corp.

Mr. Briskin called today to check on our evaluation of his three samples received on 2/16/72. He informed him that we did not have enough material (3.7 grams) to properly evaluate his samples. I requested that he supply us additional non-tobacco material. He was concerned that we were evaluating his non-tobacco material at the 100% level. He felt we should blend it at the 20% level with tobacco since his materials had no flavor or casing. I assured him we could evaluate materials at the 100% level if they were significant improvements over current technology.

He went on to say that he had considerable losses in the stock market and needs finances to support his Ph.D.’s. He stated that Galleher (subsidiary of American) had agreed to pay him $10,000 for his earlier samples since they were concerned about ICI. He didn’t accept because he is interested in working with Philip Morris.

Reynolds wanted the worldwide rights to his material and after smoking his recent 50/50 sheet have requested his 100% non-tobacco material. This is why he is pushing us for an evaluation since he would prefer working with Philip Morris.

I requested 40-50 grams of his non-tobacco material and he felt he might be able to supply 10-15 grams. He claims he has developed a binder which has absolutely no contribution to the smoke.

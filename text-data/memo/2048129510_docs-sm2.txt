Subject: Cigarette Brand Shares - July 1980

July’s industry sales were off 4.3% versus 1979 (-6.3% calendar adjusted) due to a price increase last year. Likewise, reflecting the price increase, year-to-date industry figures were 1.1% below 1979 levels and 1.4% behind when calendar adjusted. Year-to-date comparisons through August are expected to be more representative of the industry’s performance.

Philip Morris (30.9) recorded a slight decline for the month, as did Brown & Williamson (13.6). R.J. Reynolds (32.7), affected by the combination of the discontinuation of Winston Menthol 100's, Salem Box, Marl and Tempo, and the national introduction of Salem Ultras, had a small increase. American (10.7) and Lorillard (9.8) also gained some share. Liggett & Myers (2.3) remained unchanged.

Among the leading brands, Marlboro (17.7) retreated from last month’s high. Declines were also evident in Winston (13.2) and Kool (9.9). Salem (9.1) enjoyed the largest increase due to the launch of Salem Ultras (0.6). Other gainers included Merit (4.3), Kent (5.0) and Camel (4.3). B & H 100’s (4.4), Pall Mall (5.2) and Vantage (3.7) held steady.

The Low Tar category tar level groups (Chart 6) have been revised from 0-8mg, 6-9mg, to 0-6mg, 7-11mg respectively, to include Vantage Ultra Lights (6mg.) and Salem Ultras (6mg. Kings, 6mg. 100’s).

The Low Tar category (41.5) surged, aided by the launch of Salem Ultras.
Low Tar 80/85's (24.3), now known as “Non-Menthol Low Tar” (24.1), all registered share increases. The New Non-Menthol Low Tar series is unbranded. Among the recent new brands, Vantage Cambridge and Vogue 100’s are showing the strongest performance.

Of the other major categories, menthol share (29.8) gained 0.3 (1.1%) while smokers cigarettes (16.4) declined slightly.

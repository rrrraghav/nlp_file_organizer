SUBJECT: INSTRUMENTATION FOR VISA/278

We already have the capability in Technical Services to measure Tar/Nic/CO, circumference, open/sealed pressure drop, ends stability,
and ventilation of the VISA cigarettes. However, additional and/or
modified equipment will be needed for the Development Center and
Factories. Also, our firmness and coal retention units are not
applicable to this product.

Therefore, the future needs in instrumentation are as follows:

*   AWM/WD instrument modified for the Development Center and
    Factories.

*   Automatic Tape Gauge (ATG) modified for the Development
    Center and Factories.

If firmness and coal retention are needed, some comparative
methods would have to be developed by the Analytical Division.

If you have any question, please contact the writer.

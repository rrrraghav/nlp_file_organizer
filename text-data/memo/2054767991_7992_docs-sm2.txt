Subject: 5A01-Project Tomorrow Development Qrly

This memo summarizes the efforts of the Development Team for the first quarter 1994. The attached spreadsheet and graphs will summarize the current estimated manpower allocation and budget status.

Process Engineering and Material Testing
• Replaced nylon tracks and modified metal shims to eliminate dripping on MOD. Machine runnability was greatly improved during a performance run conducted on 3/17/94.
• Munising IV trials were conducted 3/17/94 to 3/23/94. Twenty-five banded papers were produced. Papers made of 0% CMC had processing problems. The matrix was run with models containing Avicel with 4% and 8% CMC. Cigarettes made from these papers are in support of the cigarette design model.
• MOD trials were conducted on 4/5/94 to 4/7/94 (outside end of first quarter but included by default). The slurries consisted of 15 Eucalyptus and 2 Aspen wood pulps. A third Aspen paper was not produced due to slurry refinement problems. Cigarettes made from these papers are in support of the cigarette design model.
• KC has indicated that they are considering 3% CMC, 6% PVOH, 3% Na Alginate, and 3% Na Alginate plus Acid as their industry samples for banded papers using the groove process. KC shipped bobbins on 13 April. The papers and cigarettes will begin evaluation/fabrication starting May.

Worked diligently to get RC on board with project management. Both parties have agreed to a monthly format. RC’s manpower allocations continue to be a major concern. The goals and objectives of this project will be greatly jeopardized if these resources are not in place by April 22, 1994.

Measurements and Methods Development
• Trials on the rewinder table indicate that band inspection results are largely independent of rewinding speeds (67 to 395 m/min). However, banded paper in which the slurry contained 20% calcium carbonate showed increased difficulty in band detection. DCS Corp. is working to optimize the sign to noise ratio. PM will also continue to evaluate additional banded paper configuration/design options.
• The Fibus built PM 470 (used annotations) permeability of cigarette papers from .5 to .50 s-1 (Coresia) is working well. This instrument is currently used to verify paper permeability during and after milling. A measurement with RC is planned to QA results from the equipment.

I talked with R. Frear on September 4th concerning reconstituted
tobacco. Mr. Frear has arranged a meeting in Spotswood, NJ on
September 26th. Attending for Kimberly-Clark will be Mr. Azeez,
Mr. Frear, Dr. Cartwright, Mr. Matina and Mr. Moskal. Currently B&W
will be represented by Dr. Chakraborty, Dr. Litzinger, Mr. Strubel, and
myself. The topics for the meeting are:

1. Further improvements in EBR.

2. Quality control of reconstituted tobaccos.

Mr. R. Frear told me that the Kimberly-Clark plant will have a report
available for us at the meeting on improving EBR uniformity by
changing or better controlling process parameters.

I reminded Mr. Frear that we had not as yet received the minutes from
our first research program on reconstituted tobacco. Mr. Frear stated
he had seen a draft and he believed that the draft was being reviewed
by Dr. H. Todd. We can expect the draft minutes shortly.

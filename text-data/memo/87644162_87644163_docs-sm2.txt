MEMORANDUM October 1, 1975

TO: Mr. C. L. Tucker

FROM: A. M. Ihrig Permanent Gas

SUBJECT: Vapor Phase Analysis on Recently Submitted Samples

The organic vapor phase, HCN, and permanent gas analysis are complete for Fact, 4092, 4093, MAX, L. T. Brown, and Saratoga. Fact is a 85 mm cigarette being test marketed by Brown and Williamson. The cigarette has a specially constructed filter containing a smoke filtering resin (probably Duolite A-2), manufactured by Diamond Shamrock. Samples 4092 and 4093 are the prototype of the Kent Golden Lights. The remaining samples are commercially available cigarettes. The results of this study are given in the attached table.

The only parameter that is substantially different for Fact, as compared to other 85 mm cigarettes, is HCN. The resinous filter additive apparently removes approximately 50 percent of the HCN.

The permanent gas analysis indicates approximately 40 percent air dilution for Samples 4092 and 4093. Undoubtedly, 4092 and 4093 should have very low tar and nicotine levels.

The striking similarity in the organic vapor phase for 85 mm and 120 mm cigarettes is probably due to a fortuitous combination of circumstances, such as similar tobacco weights, longer burn time, and more air dilution for 120 mm cigarettes. The effect of air dilution on CO/N2 and CO2/N2 ratios becomes very apparent in the comparison of permanent gas data.

FROM : Harvey R. Pearman, Jr.

SUBJECT: Grade Sample No. 358

We have completed our analysis of a sample of 70-mm. non-filter cigarettes identified by Mr. Welborn as Grade Sample No. 358. The tobacco employed in making this sample was Grade VGE 1963.

It is our understanding that this grade is to be considered as a replacement in the KENT, OLD GOLD, YORK, and OLD GOLD FILTER blends for Grade VGE 1962 (Grade Sample No. 328).

The mean results of smoking tests and a comparison with the grade to be replaced are listed below:

Weight Draw Tars Nicotine
(328) Previous Grade
VGE 1962 1.040 0.36 20.0 1.47

(358) Replacement Grade
VGE 1963 0.922 0.52 21.7 1.96

The mean firmness of these cigarettes as received by the laboratory was 28.

CONFIDENTIAL:
MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION

April 3, 1972

MEMORANDUM

TO: Kitty Golden
FROM: William Kloepher, Jr.

Based on the decision of the Executive Committee to have
audience tests conducted for our movie and for the
Communications Committee’s proposed advertising, I
think it best for you to include single room requests
at the Homestead for Mr. Warren Donahue and Mr. Valentine
Appel both of New York, for the nights of Mary 24 and 25.

SUBJECT: Marlboro Promotion Programs Qualitative Report

Attached is the moderator’s report on the recently conducted series of focus groups on Marlboro promotion ideas developed by Young & Rubicam. Key findings include:

* “Marlboro Country” offers opportunities to broaden and contemporize the brand's image through connections to both environmentalism and adventure.

* The concept of "The Marlboro Foundation" which would purchase open land for preservation offered particularly strong imagery and made consumers feel good about choosing Marlboro. However, there was also considerable cynicism as to the company’s motives which made any retail tie-in suspect.

* The “Marlboro Adventure Team” concept (as executed by Y&R) offered greater potential for promotional programs but was limited in its appeal. While some men relished the idea of an all out adventure in Marlboro Country, most were somewhat intimidated. They would prefer weekend hiking or fishing trips rather than more strenuous "adventures."

* Some of the later groups combined the ideas and were excited by the concept of a Marlboro Environmental SWAT Team that would perform “heroic” clean-ups and respond to natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew. There appeared to be strong appeal to the idea of modern-day Marlboro Men publicly performing strenuous "good deeds."

Subject: Flavor Development Weekly Summary - Week of August 14, 1989

PROJECT ART:

A low pressure trial was run at the Bermuda Hundred Factory. Four (4) loops of filler were extracted at 2400 psi, 140 °F and 150 M/M. Extraction efficiency will be requested in the low-ultra-, K9/100mm and regular and menthol versions.

Bermuda Hundred Modules IIA and IIB achieved targeted extraction efficiency. Models were made and subjected to sensory evaluation from both. Subjective approval was given for both Module IIA and IIB for production of BERM, CIG 8 and CTC 8M filler.

A large-scale casing trial using 89C-392 pilot plant filler has been completed in semi-works with new casing formulation (8611-78-1). Cigarettes have been requested with aftercut (4mg) for comparisons to the current casings and without aftercut (0, 11, and 15mg) for further laboratory evaluation of new aftercut systems.

All of the filter modification models have been made and are in analytical for physical testing. Subjective evaluation of the models has been initiated. Evaluations continue with alkaline treatment of filler and filters in an effort to increase overall response of ART cigarette smoke.

The large-scale portion of the nicotine add-back study is complete. The nicotine add-back for small-scale has been rescheduled for early September.

Subjective screening has been completed of 244 RL’s (Marilboro configuration) from Park 500 with 24 and 41 Bermuda stem. The Rl 4 level again was clearly different. Evaluation of combinations of these Rl's with test SCF’s (11 and 16 Bermuda stem) at normal levels in Marlboro are in progress to select models for PSU tests. PSU SS tests done on approx. ten blends each, using both Park 500 and semi-works cigarettes have shown encouraging subjective results with HH OB and Ca(OH)2 treatments. Analytical and subjective tests are in progress to establish specifications for Louisville ZS production trials.

AMBOUFIA:

Biochemistry and analytical data indicate that amounts of 215 Vanillin (Ligustice Aetall) are reported 200 times higher than those found in control blends. The levels of 215 Vanillin are being investigated to determine the source.

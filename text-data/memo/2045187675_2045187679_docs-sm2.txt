FROM: Joann J. Cunningham DATE: December 11, 1987

SUBJECT: Elan Displays

Lou,

We need samples of displays by as early next week as
possible. I know you provided some of these but since the Elan
packs are thinner (like Capri) you recommended resizing them.
Also we need displays for incentive offers, I just wanted you to
know what is still to come.

- Two for one bins, 20 and 40 deals only. The use of 80
has been discontinued.

- Set sell displays (slanted) for 20 horizontal and 20 and
30 vertical.

- Two with Incentive - Incentive will be a carded lighter
with packs of Elan. I don’t have the final lighter yet
but will early next week. Offer will be available in two
sizes, 20 and 40 deal.

- A-1 On-Carton - No final incentive here either, but
should be done next week. This will be a 20 deal display
only.

Based on cost input from you and Lee Payne, we are taking
another look at the stationery and pre-booking form. We will
have those back to you in a few weeks.

Please call if you have any questions.

JJC/ss

MEMORANDUM

May 11, 1976

TO: Mr. E. W. O’Neill

FROM: C. L. Tucker

SUBJECT: Taste Evaluation of Menthol Samples

Preliminary taste evaluations have been made on menthol samples received from UHC Co. and Mannheimer.
A copy of the report is attached.

Although neither sample was rated quite equivalent
to the current production Brazilian in taste character-
istics, they are both probably within the range of
acceptability. The UHC Brazilian was preferred over
the Mannheimer Penguin brand. The latter sample was
designated as being formosan but the ratio of neo-
menthol to neoisomenthol indicates that the menthol
is from plants grown in Brazil.

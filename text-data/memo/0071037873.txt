Laboratory Test No. 1979-5A - CARLTON Filter 100’s Control versus CARLTON Filter 100's
Blend (Dual Filter)

Nineteen "low-tar" and expert smokers located at the Department of Research and
Development were each given coded samples of the above samples and asked for a
preference and comments. The results are:

Control 8
Dual Filter 7
No Choice 4

Preference is a standoff. Panelists’ comments indicate the Control was considered to
have a better taste and draw with the Dual Filter's draw being too easy

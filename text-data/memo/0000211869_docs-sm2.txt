SUBJECT: YANKELOVITCH MONITOR NO. 7 - SMOKER VS. NON-SMOKER ANALYSIS

Background
Sandy Hoffman of Yankelovich, Skelly and White, Inc. has sent us smoker/non-smoker breakdowns for the trends measured in the Monitor No. 7. The smoker/non-smoker categories result from positive/negative answers to the question: "Do you smoke at least one pack of cigarettes per week?" I can make this raw data available to you upon request.

Conclusions
• The following five trends showed meaningful differences between the smokers and non-smokers:

1. Social Pluralism - acceptance of many life-styles.
2. New Romanticism - desire to restore romance, mystery, and adventure to life.
3. Away From Self-Improvement - rejection of the Protestant Ethic.

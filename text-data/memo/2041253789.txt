SUBJECT: 1994 V Wear QualiVue -- Final Report

Attached are the findings from the QualiVue study recently completed on the 1994 V Wear mailing. Overall, the objective of the study was to understand consumer response to the 1994 V Wear program and to provide input for order quantities. Specific areas of interest were as follows: the relative appeal of various items included in the collection, the brand and smoker imagery projected by the Catalog, and a comparison of the 1994 and 1993 V Wear Catalogs. We also examined consumer awareness and involvement with the Virginia Slims Club concept.

Methodology
Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted among 179 female smokers who were aware of receiving the 1994 V Wear Catalog mailing. The sample was drawn from the Philip Morris Direct Mail Database and was representative of the mailing’s demographic profile: all were female smokers, with 30% aged 21-34, 30% aged 35-44 and 40% aged 45-64; in terms of regular brand usage, 65% smoke Virginia Slims and the remaining 35% competitive 100’s/120’s cigarettes. We also made sure that we spoke to at least 30 women who had responded to the 1993 Catalog.

This analysis is a synthesis of both closed-ended tabulations and open-ended responses.

Summary of Findings
As indicated in the Topline, overall response to the 1994 Catalog was very favorable. The 1994 V Wear Catalog was very effective in generating attention and involvement, with readership and interest in ordering significantly higher for the 1994 Catalog than for its 1993 counterpart. The Catalog also served to reinforce smokers’ already positive perceptions of Virginia Slims imagery -- as a brand for sociable, modern, active, and stylish young adult women. These perceptions of the brand's orientation are consistent with what we hear expressed about the Catalog’s image during qualitative research.

When rating the 1993 and 1994 Catalogs on a series of attributes, the one big difference between the two is that the 1994 Catalog is viewed as more upscale than the 1993 version. This is because the 1994 Catalog’s unique styling and presentation -- the “packaging” was described as classy, professional and tasteful, and thereby worthy of someone to read it (and potentially do business with). The photography is beautiful, a very good use of space, the design is well-executed and the overall look is sophisticated.

We also noted significant consistency in attitudes toward the V Wear program.

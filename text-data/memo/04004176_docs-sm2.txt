MEMORANDUM

1961

DATE: May 28, 1987
TO: William R. Treisler, Regional Vice President
FROM: Harry L. Kelley, Executive Director
SUBJECT: DuPage County Policy Proposal

On Wednesday, May 27, I attended the meeting of the Special Committee of the
DuPage County Board on a smoking policy procedure. The following were in
attendance: Ed Weibel, Chairman; John Case, Rich Carlson, and Gene Cole.
The following board members were absent: Floyd Sanford and Connie Zimmerman.
Also attending were Debbie Hess, staff member; Sandy Young, DuPage County
Employees Benefit Committee; Jack Tomlinson, Director of Human Resources.

Enclosed is a copy of the Resolution that they will sent out to all elected
officials and department heads.

As connected with me last again on Tuesday, June 17, in the Public Safety
Center at 1:00 P.M., Roger Co. I plan to attend this meeting at which time
they’ll have a good-back from the elected officials and department heads
on the proposed policy, which as for county buildings only, and it is
anticipated they will submit the proposal to the County Board for their
approval on June 23 or 24. I am to receive another copy of the proposal
with some additional changes which I will forward to you.

What they are doing is in essence going along with our voluntary compliance
program and setting up a smoking policy for the county employees only. I
can see this becoming an advantage to us since this is the largest county
in the state next to Cook County and a state organization might not be needed
in the future.

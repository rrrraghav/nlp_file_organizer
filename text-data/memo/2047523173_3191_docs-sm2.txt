FROM: Doron Stern
SUBJECT: Marlboro Alternate Volume Profiles

The attached tables seek to identify the non-Marlboro subgroups who contribute more than their fair share to Marlboro volume on an alternate basis (Inflow), as well as the Marlboro subgroups who contribute less than their fair share to competitive brands on an alternate basis (Outflow). The objective is to provide insights into the geo-demographic groups that are critical to the Marlboro franchise in determining key offensive and defensive strategic initiatives.

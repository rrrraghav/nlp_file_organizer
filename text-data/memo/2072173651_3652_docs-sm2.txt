PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017

TO: Rhud Houminer DATE: March 3, 1986

FROM: Victor Timucu

SUBJECT: Sale of "Rothmans" brands by Philip Morris under license in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean.

As you know, Philip Morris Incorporated has a license from Rembrandt Group Limited, whereby Philip Morris may exploit certain cigarette brands in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean.

For calendar year 1985, the sales results for all those licensed brands have been:

U.S.A. 162,179,720
U.S.A. Duty - Free 102,740,400
Export to Latin America/Caribbean 67,610,000
TOTAL 332,530,120

The cigarettes have been made for Philip Morris on a contract manufacture basis by Rothmans Canada, Rothmans International and Liggett Group. The marginal contribution after contract manufacture, but before any expenses, is approximately $9 per 1000 cigarettes i.e. almost $3 million. The royalty owed to "Rembrandt" on such cigarette sales is $86,337.14 for calendar 1985.

There is also the smoking tobacco sublicence from Philip Morris to Lane Limited. On these sales, Philip Morris Incorporated retains $80,907 in royalty income, while a royalty of $45,453.50 has been paid to Rembrandt Group's U.S.A. subsidiary Larus & brother Company.

New License from Swiss company
There has been some concern about Philip Morris Incorporated’s continued participation as the maker and distributor of these cigarette brands. A suggestion has been made to substitute a new licensee (i.e. a Swiss company). This option has been examined, but appears extremely complicated and impractical. The only feasible way to arrange this license from a Swiss Company would be via a New Agreement. A new license agreement from a Swiss company would have the following effects:

Pro
No continuing license or distribution relationship with a South African company.

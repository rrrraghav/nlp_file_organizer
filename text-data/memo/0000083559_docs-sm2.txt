SUBJECT: Menthol And Triacetin Loss From Arctic Lights Filter-Rods

SUMMARY

Louisville Branch Department has conducted four separate tests to determine the rates of menthol and triacetin loss from Arctic Lights filter rods under various storage conditions.
Analyses have been conducted by both R&D and Branch Technical Service. The results of these tests indicate no significant loss of menthol or triacetin regardless of storage conditions.
A recommendation is presented that Arctic Lights filter rods be handled and stored using normal procedures with no special protective measures being taken to control menthol loss.

INTRODUCTION

During the early development work for Arctic Lights it was recognized that some special precautions might be required to prevent loss of menthol from filter rods. Dr. Hultkamp obtained samples from two trays of filter rods over a 5 day period and reported a substantial loss of menthol (Dr. N. B. Hultkamp to D. V. Cantrell, April 17, 1978). Dr. Hultkamp’s report indicated only a very slight loss of triacetin.

Two possible methods were devised for preventing menthol loss from Arctic Lights filter rods. The first was a specially constructed filter rod tray which was totally enclosed on the top and all four sides. The bottom fit flush with the shelf of a tray trolley to form a nearly air tight container. The top cover made was a sealed tray trolley with plywood sides, top and bottom. Doors were fitted to the trolley with metal frames and felt gaskets.

A series of tests was designed to evaluate the various methods of holding Arctic Lights filter rods.

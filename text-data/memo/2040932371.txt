Re: Merit Blind Challenge 1990

This is our research plan for the Merit Blind Challenge '90.

We will conduct unidentified mail research among participants in the program. Measures will include SOS, SOP, and attitudes towards the brand.

We expect to mail to 16,000 participants (3,200 per cell) the cells will break down as follows:

Cell 1: Database - test creative
Cell 2: Database - control creative
Cell 3: Media (Cosmo/Rolling Stone) - test creative
Cell 4: Media (Cosmo/Rolling Stone) - control creative
Cell 5: Media (People) - test creative

Within each delivery vehicle, we will balance the sample on sex, age, brand and brand characteristics.

The research will be fielded in July. Elliot and Jennie, we will need a tape of responders by the end of June/beginning of July. The tape should include whether the respondent came from Media '80's BRD if possible or the database and the respondent’s sex, age, brand name, tar, length, flavor, creative type (test vs. control), and media source (magazine). The supplier will be Datatab.

Additionally, we will be issuing overall response profiles reports.

If you have any questions, please direct them to Karen (X3599) or Rachel (X4076).

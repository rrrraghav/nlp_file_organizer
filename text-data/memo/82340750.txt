To: Distribution
From: JoAnn Paradiso
Date: February 1, 1995
Subject: Direct Marketing Project - Status

The following documents outline progress made since the last status was distributed in early
December of 1994. The business model for the Direct Marketing pilot is being built with the
current Kent and True promotions. If necessary, MIS will modify the model based on feedback
from the Market Planning and Brand Management members of the project team. Upon
acceptance of the model by the project team, activities to incorporate all of the Epsilon data will
begin.

Cognos PowerPlay training has been scheduled for March 29th and 30th, in the 14th floor
training room. "Teach Yourself Windows" computer based training has been installed on the
Marketing LAN and is accessible by the Direct Marketing project team. This self training
course can be used to help Marketing and Brand Management become more comfortable with
the Windows environment. Refer to the attached training schedule for more details.

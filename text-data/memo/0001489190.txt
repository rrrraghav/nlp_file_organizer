LON STAR MERCHANDISING

1. Review proposed use of $250,000 for photography of initial
campaign.  Client feels that this is not the proper way to use develop-
ment schedule and would rather see program product research instead
of photography at this time.

2. It was Brand Group’s belief that Moore should be searched for a
company who could handle all advertising and the burning product pro-
duction, as well as film production.  Moore is in contact.

3. It was Brand Group's view that more impact and more affinity should be
developed with the consumer.  They feel that this can be done through
promise of a more satisfying experience.

4. Brand Group will seek availability of the name "Brand". Agency will
submit other names for consideration.

NEXT STEP: In addition to these directions, Agency will prepare much adver-
tising executions of additional directions as discussed, for review
at next meeting scheduled for January 9.

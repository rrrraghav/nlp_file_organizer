INTER - OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

                       Richmond, Virginia

To: Dr. A. C. Lilly Date: February 13, 1990

From: Dr. G. J. Patskan

Subject: Operational Plans for the Lowered Biological Activity Program -
         1990

I. OBJECTIVE

To decrease the activity of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) by 90%,
relative to 2RI CSC, as determined by multiple in vitro assays.

II. STRATEGIES

1. Bioassay Development: Establish in vitro bioassays which can
   differentiate among CSCS from various model cigarettes.

2. Model Development: Prepare model cigarettes designed to reduce
   biological activity.

3. Model Evaluation: Test CSC from new model cigarettes.

4. Model Optimization: Improve the subjectives of a low activity
   model.

5. Information Survey: Gather information from the outside scien-
   tific community relevant to biological activity.

III. TACTICS AND TIMETABLE

A. BIOASSAY DEVELOPMENT

1. Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Binding Assay

    a. Status: Arachidonic acid metabolism does not appear to
       be involved in the reduction of EGF binding caused by
       CSC. Preliminary experiments investigating the effect
       of down regulation of protein kinase C on the response
       to CSC were conducted. The chromatographic removal of
       catechol from CSC was determined to be too non-selec-
       tive.

    b. Plans:

        1. Complete experiments evaluating the effects of down
           regulation of protein kinase C on the response to
           CSC (1st Quarter, 1990).

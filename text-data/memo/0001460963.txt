Dear Rob,

The need for on-going information exchange among key BAT
companies was agreed at the "Best Practices" Product Testing
Conference in Louisville earlier this year.

The attached document outlines a suggested format for starting
this exchange. Periodic updates would follow semi-annually (or
more frequently if the group feels appropriate).

Please send your information directly to me. I will compile and
distribute to the group.

Thanks very much for your cooperation. Although considerable
effort will be required to compile the information requested,
hopefully we will all benefit from sharing ideas, insights, and
approaches.

When you receive your complete report, if any of the subjects
spark a particular interest, feel free to contact the
originator for more details.

Finally, a note about security requirements for this subject
matter appears to be appropriate.

Please note that copies of documents pertaining to this
subject will be marked "SECRET" and will be numbered.

Please keep this information confidential, and do not make
copies.

Please confirm that you have received your copy upon
receipt.

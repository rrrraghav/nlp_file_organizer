MEMORANDUM

July 16, 1993

TO: Dr. A. W. Spears

SUBJECT: Harley-Davidson Milds/Japan



Subsequent to our discussions of July 14, I have reviewed the Tobacco Institute of Japan (TIOJ) regulations and our T&N data. The TIOJ tolerances require that verification values be within ± 2% of the printed values on the package.

We notified PBI in March (copy attached) that our initial values were 1 mg “tar” and 0.1 mg nicotine lower than our printed values; PBI recently advised R. Hammer that TIOJ’s data confirmed our results. The data for our May/June runs (attached) correspond exactly to our printed values.

Based on the above, no modifications to our existing printed materials are required.

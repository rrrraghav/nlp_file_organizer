MEMORANDUM

TO: James J. Morgan

FROM: Albert BIssemeyer, III

SUBJECT: The Target Audience for Project TIMER

This memo will serve to present a point of view on
the subject of the market segment expected to be the target for
TIMER, and therefore, what population of smokers should be drawn
for product test purposes. The conclusion is that TIMER should
be aimed at all smokers of 80-85 mm. filter (non-menthol and
menthol) cigarettes, and Marketing Research has been advised to
proceed accordingly.

As a product delivering very low tar, TIMER obviously
will have appeal to all smokers who wish to smoke or are cur-
rently smoking low tar delivery brands. Our Tracking Study Report
shows that in 1975 the low tar category (cigarettes delivering
15 mgs. of "tar" or less) accounted for 12% of all smokers, a
number that has increased by 71% since 1970:

Low Tar Smokers

1970   7%
1971   8%
1972   8%
1973   9%
1974   9%
1975  12%

The growth and importance of this segment of the market
can be seen by the growth in volume shown by important brands
of this type as reported by Maxwell. (Volume in billions.)

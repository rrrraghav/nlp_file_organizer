RE: Merit Maxi Campaign K. Takasugi

This memo summarizes our point of view regarding the recently developed Merit "Maxi" campaign, as described in the attached documents.

Merit in Europe

It seems to me that the “Maxi” campaign was developed in the context of Merit’s current market position in Italy, Switzerland, France and other European countries. The “Formula 1 of the sea” concept is, in my view, a logical and appropriate extension of the current promotion-driven brand communication in Italy for several reasons.

First, it builds on an existing sailing-related brand image and focuses on the specialized area of maxi yachts, the "Formula 1 of the Sea". Given the tremendous popularity and understanding, and extensive media coverage of competitive sailing in Europe, this campaign associates Merit with the dimension of sailing that most spectators are interested in; the high action, technology, challenge and risk.

Second, in the context of the legal media and creative restrictions in several European markets, this campaign seems to work best without light-up and smoking shots; high action and smoking are often not compatible.

Thirdly, through its high energy/high action execution, the campaign communicates “flavor”, rather than lightness. Assuming that Merit already has a firm reputation as a low tar brand, this change in communication may widen the brand’s appeal, especially among younger male smokers.

To: Mr. W. B. Crildin date: April 1, 1971
From: C. B. Hoelzel
Subject: Sodium Chlorate Hazards

With respect to our recent discussion on this subject, I have
requested the Technical Information Facility (Cynthia O’Donohue)
to examine the literature in two aspects:

1. Permissible limits of admixture with regard to fire
and explosion hazard.

2. Human toxicity.

MEMORANDUM

The American Tobacco Company

DATE December 3, 1968

TO Mr. Robert K. Heimann
Executive Vice President

FROM Henry W. Bahrenburg
Product Manager

SUBJECT

This is to report the findings of the “taste panel” regarding test cigarettes designated -

11/12/68

TAREYTON Cigarettes with
Special Charcoal Filter

Of the fifteen responses that were obtained, eight indicated no difference between the test model and our current product. Seven respondents noted at least a slight difference (5 – milder, 1 – harsher, 1 – artificial taste).

Regular TAREYTON smokers noted less of a difference than non-TAREYTON smokers; of the seven TAREYTON smokers on the panel, five could not distinguish between the two cigarettes, two thought the test model to be milder.

Based on the above, I believe the taste of the test model would be acceptable to TAREYTON smokers. While the next step in developing this product might logically be market-testing (in a warehouse area, for example), I do not recommend that such a test be conducted at this time. The charcoal in the test product is considerably more costly than at present ($640.00 more per year by one preliminary estimate) and the New Products Division believes that cost reduction is possible. In view of the potential cost reduction, and in view of lack’s inability to show growth with a product of comparable filtering qualities, I believe that New products should be given more time to work on the cost aspect of this project.

SUBJECT: HHD II EFFECT ON SMOKE DELIVERIES OF CONTEMPORIZED KOOL 100’S

The work reported in this Memo is part of a comprehensive study by the Process and Product Departments to determine how high humidity drying II (HHD II) affects cigarette physical quality, smoke delivery, and smoke quality. This report covers the effect of HHD II on smoke deliveries and smoke quality only.

In this work, we used two contemporized versions of KOOL 100. One version used XLP-416 (KOOL Hilda blend with LNB WTS) with a ventilated filter while the other version used XLP-415 (current KOOL 100 blend with LNB WTS) and no ventilation.

Data presented in Table 1 and attachments indicate no difference in smoke deliveries between HHD I and II when products are made to equal density. The slight difference in delivery between the vented versions is not an effect of HHD II, but rather it is due to differences in filter efficiency and ventilation rate between the vented samples.

Sensory evaluations indicate no significant difference between HHD I and II.

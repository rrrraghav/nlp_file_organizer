RE: CARLTON Magazine Coupon

This is the third report on redemptions for a CARLTON magazine coupon
that appeared during the 5th Sales Campaign (4/23-5/25). The offer
was for a free pack with pack purchase, or $1.50 off toward a carton
purchase.

We have attained a 0.38% redemption rate thus far (1% was budgeted
for the program). Life & Money magazine lowest, while Weight Watchers
was highest. Above average redemption rates were achieved by:

People
Family Circle
National Enquirer
Weight Watchers
True Story
Decorating & Craft Ideas

The carton offer accounted for 2 of every 3 redemptions. This report
adds the week ending 8/24 which was our highest response week to date,
accounting for 32% of total redemptions.

Weekly Report - Blend Development

Project CTC

Experimental Blend CTC-31 has been repeated since there is some indication that the initial blend has a level of PET higher than the target of 25%. This blend is being flavored today.

Project TC

The experimental HALF AND HALF Cigarette blend reported last week has been completed and cigarettes have been made. This modified blend contains 10% BRS-B and a 50% reduction in the invert syrup content. Test cigarettes delivering 17 mg "tar" are being paneled in-laboratory versus controls at 23 mg "tar."

Project LLCT

Efforts on this project have been somewhat hampered by the recent decision not to use saccharin. Work to develop a competitive product continues and the use of fructose, molasses, and a raisin extract shows some promise in achieving a reasonable level of sweetness and fruity character. Sufficient quantities of an experimental blend are being prepared for a small scale panel versus Red Man.

Other

Experimental and control SILVA THINS Filter blends have been prepared and will be sent to Durham branch for fabrication of cigarettes. The experimental blend contains 7% R-11 expanded BRS-55 and 15% RC-TM replacing 12% BRS-55 and 10% RC-TM.

Additional experimental SILVA THINS Filter blends have been prepared which contain BRS-B, BRS-K, and BRS-55 stems that have been treated with 10% neutralized ammonium citrate. Similar untreated stem samples have been incorporated in blend to serve as controls.

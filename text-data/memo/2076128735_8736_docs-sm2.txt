Subject: OC Walk-in Panel Extended Smoking Test of Two Trim Models

Purpose

The purpose of this test was to determine whether there were subjective
differences with extended smoking of two ultrathin cigarettes: PM Trim 1
blend control, and the PM Trim 4 model with calcium carbonate, -42 perforated
paper, and CMC.

Methods

Sixty flavor-low smokers from the OC Walk-in Panel participated in this test.
Each panelist was given one pack of the test cigarette and one pack of the
control, and asked to smoke all cigarettes provided. They were then asked to
evaluate the first and last cigarette from each pack on the attributes of
mouth feel impact, aftertaste, unusual flavor, mouthcoating, tobacco
taste, and acceptability. Presentation order was balanced and analysis of
variance was used to analyze the data.

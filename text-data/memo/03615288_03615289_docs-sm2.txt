A. L. Kacin - St. Louis Advertisers to Include
R. E. Kane - Atlanta Warning Statements

I'm writing regarding a proposed Congressional Bill, H.R. 5653, which would force advertisers to include questionable warning statements relative to the use of the products by the public despite the fact that such products are legal, legitimate and claim-substantiated. This is a violation of free speech and free choice and could, if enacted, affect liquor, drug, appliances, automotive, etc., other products and their advertisers.

Attached is a suggested letter for you and your associates to use (on your personal stationery) and the list of members in the House of Representatives on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Select a few or write them all. In addition, any cooperation from those outside your office, clients, friends, etc., can add to the volume of mail which could have considerable influence in this situation.

Prompt action on your part is imperative and we apologize for the short notice.

Please see that copies of all letters are forwarded to Bob Berman, DMM/New York.

RE: 1976 Switching Study

This forwards MCA’s excellent Switching Study summary for your consideration and records.

1. I share MCA's overall conclusion that the Switching
Study confirms the rightness of our 5 Year Plan; focussing
Company effort against smokers’ health concerns. Within
this focus, Ben’s analysis points toward some interesting
roles played by various types of cigarettes:

   * Menthol, Light extensions and 100's seem to be
     satisfying smokers’ symptomatic irritation concerns.

   * ‘Low T&N brands seem to be satisfying smokers’
     intellectual T&N concerns.

This view suggests sensible positionings for those Lorillard brands
that directly address smokers’ health concerns. (I believe these
are totally compatible with ongoing work). These positionings are:

   * Kent 13, Newport Lights, OGF Lights for satisfaction
     of irritation concerns; with taste appropriate to
     each parent brand and differing target demographics.

   * RGL, True 5’s for satisfaction of T&N concerns;
     with taste appropriate to each parent brand, these
     T&N levels and target demographics.

   * Enriched nicotine (a break through solution)
     for both taste satisfaction and low numbers;
     especially for young adult smokers.

Figge Patent

Mr. Goldsmlth has made arrangements with the Legal Department to proceed with the negotiations to acquire the Figge patent. Mr. Allen Blank will carry the ball for them, and he has been impressed with the need to move with alacrity. Mr. Blank will probably contact us in the next day or two, and we should then fill him in completely with respect as to what has taken place. He may wish to use Mr. Cochran, but that is up to him.

Please let me know if Mr. Blank contacts you. If not, we will get in touch with him.

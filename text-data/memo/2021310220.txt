Subject: Visibility Results - Project ART

At the request of Dr. J. O. Lephardt, the sidestream particulate generation
rate (PGR), surface mean size, and visibility were determined for two
samples from Project ART. One sample was the control (pack code #3487) and
the other was one which had a 94% reduction in nicotine by supercritical
extraction (pack code #3609). The visibility obtained for the test sample
was 17% less than that of the control. This decrease can be attributed
primarily to the 15% decrease in the particulate generation rate and, to a
lesser extent, to the 5% decrease in the surface mean size.

The results are listed below, along with the results we have obtained for a
Marlboro 85.



Sample HBR PGR Size Visibility*
(ms/min) (arb. units) (μm)
Control 70.2 67 0.125 0.75
Test 74.9 59 0.119 0.62
Marlboro 85 67.3 57 0.125 0.61

*The visibility, V, reported here is the extinction coefficient at 546 nm.
It can be approximately related to the visibility, Vβ, reported by Barbro
Goodman using the empirical relationship, V = .893[2n (1 - Vβ) ]

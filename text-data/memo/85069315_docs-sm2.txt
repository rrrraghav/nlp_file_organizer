MEMORANDUM

January 23, 1975

TO: Mr. Gordon Flinn

FROM: Sara Ridgway

RE: OGP Portfolio Research

As we discussed, the requested OGP Portfolio Research study to determine the executionable direction for the new OGP creative campaign may be one of the singularly most important things we do this year. Further, time is of the essence, and we must field this test the week of February 10th. Creative elements from CBA will be available not later than Thursday, February 6th.

Because OLD GOLD has spent $32,976 of our $39,000 budget, and the study will cost $8,700, we would like to transfer the needed $3,676 from the NEWPORT research budget. I have discussed this with Mr. Toti and we have agreed that if he should need these funds for NEWPORT research prior to the end of the current budget period (August 31st), we will cancel advertising to reimburse him.

SUBJECT: Low Ignition Propensity Cigarettes

Direction was given to develop a modified Newport cigarette with “low ignition propensity” properties that smoked equal to the control. Prior work by A. M. Higgin and C. J. Lewis showed that a blend containing between 30% and 50% expanded tobacco and cigarette paper having a Coresia value between 9 and 11 would result in a cigarette having the desirable “low ignition” properties. Although these modifications gave the desired “low ignition” properties, the cigarettes smoked very bland and were undesirable when compared to a control Newport.

A blend containing 30% Burley/Flue cured P.T. with increased casing and recasing was developed to make the modified cigarette smoke comparable to a control Newport. This combination in addition to the low Coresia cigarette paper yielded approximately a 35-40% increase in CPM. Higher filtration and air dilution were incorporated to reduce the CPM to the control level.

Old Gold and Golden Light “low ignition propensity” cigarettes were also developed using the same blend, casing and recasing modifications.

Based on the Product Development panel tests the test samples were found comparable to the controls.

When this project was started it was referred to as "Self Extinguishing Cigarettes" Project B-337. As of December, 1990 this project will be referred to as “Low Ignition Propensity Cigarettes,” Project B-337.

Fabric ignition testing was done to determine if the test cigarettes after all combined modifications were made still exhibited low ignition properties. Also a series of analytical tests were run to determine if the smoke chemistry had changed.

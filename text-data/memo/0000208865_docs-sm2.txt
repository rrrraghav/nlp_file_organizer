SUBJ: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY - POST EVALUATION OF STORE PROFILE

We have completed a post evaluation of the Store Profile System.
Our conclusion and the more significant findings are summarized
below.

Conclusion

It is our opinion that an effective system which provides the
management information proposed by the Store Profile System (SPS) is
essential for timely marketing decisions. A great deal of work
has gone into developing the System, and many benefits have been
realized. However, not all of the benefits anticipated were
achieved, and projected costs of development and operation were
exceeded. We noted some significant problems/weaknesses in devel-
opment, implementation, and use of the Store Profile System which
have had the effect of reducing the effectiveness of those benefits
achieved. These problems are detailed in our findings and recommen-
dations. If these problems (many of which are admittedly being
addressed) can effectively be overcome, we believe the reporting
system that evolves from SPS will be able to provide extremely
valuable management information.

Findings

1. Credibility - full benefit of the SPS accomplishments has
not been realized due to a lack of credibility in the minds
of users. Some causes for this lack of credibility are:
(a) insufficient training in its use and capabilities (b)
much of the data base has been updated since robbery 1978
(i.e., older representations are being evaluated based upon
data that refers to the system and (d) problems were experienced
when SPS and the Interim Activity Reporting System were
implemented before some developmental requirements had been com-

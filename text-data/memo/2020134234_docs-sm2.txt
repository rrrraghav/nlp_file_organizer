Single-Blade Carbon Heater Evaluation:

Evaluation has begun of the first 4-blade constant contact pressure fixture prototype from Laser Mechanical. A manual switch has been installed for heater switching. This first prototype fixture was manufactured from MACOr. A second PEEK fixture is expected tomorrow. If prototype evaluations are successful, five more PEEK fixtures will be fabricated.

Tobacco Substrate Studies:

Bright and burley dust samples are being separated by mesh size (100 to <270 mesh). These samples will be used to prepare cast sheets to determine the effect of particle size on sheet integrity and subjective character.

IR camera studies of glassy carbon heaters, coated with cast tobacco sheet using Konjac flour as the adhesive, demonstrated that adhesion was maintained at heater temperatures up to 409° C. Continued modifications are being made to the binder system to increase the temperature threshold for adhesion failure. Samples of Konjac flour have been submitted to Dr. Carman for pyrolysis GC/MS analysis (300, 600 and 900° C).

MT orientational strip has been cut and adhered to carbon heater strips for baseline subjective evaluation. Two different high and lower alkaloid blend dusts (ca. 200 mesh) have been received from Flavor Development. These samples will be sieved to separate into discreet mesh sizes for cast sheet preparation and subjective screening.

Miscellaneous:

The Karl Fischer titrator has been set up and is operational, permitting accurate moisture determination on heaters, cast sheets and tobacco dust samples.

Assistance was provided to the Materials group to coat screen printed ceramic heater prototypes with tobacco sheet for thermal evaluation. A calcium crosslinked Konjac flour adhesive system resisted sheet/heater delamination at temperatures >450° C as measured by surface properties (estimated “450° C” actual). Further studies will be conducted to determine the thermocouple of the screen-printed heaters.

A meeting was held with Bill Bell, Marshall Garrett and Bob Hale of Flavor Development to begin consideration of flavor system development for the RTX prototype. Based on their initial subjective evaluation of prototypes containing Burley and Flue-Cured sheets, Bell and Garrett are selecting algal ingredients for substrate screenings being next week.

From: J.R. Tilley
Subject: Pulper discharge Pumps – Line 3

Status

A plan to test two alternative types of stators on the Line 3 Netzsch Pulper discharge pumps (memo attached for ref.) was approved and the purchase requisition submitted in mid-December. As part of the recently implemented Omnibus purchasing process, these items now must be ordered from Netzsch through Ferguson Enterprises rather than from the local Netzsch factory rep., Wood Equipment. I was informed by Wood’s sales rep. Friday 1/4/94 that the order had not been placed. According to Ferguson, as of 1/21/94, the stators are on order and delivery will be expedited. Ordinarily delivery is 6-8 weeks.

Recommendation:

I would like to add an additional evaluation to this testing plan. This would be to install one of the next larger size of the Netzsch pump (Model NE90A) on Line 3 for a direct comparison with the existing smaller model (NE80A). This would enable us to determine if the larger pump is worth the additional cost in terms of extending pump life. The existing drive and motor from the smaller pump can be reused so the primary difference between the two models is the stator and rotor size. The additional cost per pump (with the standard Ethylene Propylene (EP) stator and 316 SS rotor) is $1908.

Cost Comparison ($) NE80A vs. NE90A (per pump)

NE80A	NE90A
Stator	1126	1295
Rotor	2717	4446
Total	3,923	5,831
Difference	1,908

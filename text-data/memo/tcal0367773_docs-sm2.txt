MEMORANDUM VIA OVERNIGHT MAIL March 2, 1998

TO: Ballot Issues Committee
CA Local Team

FROM: Patrick Donoho flact

SUBJECT: Research on CA Initiatives

Attached for your information is research on the pending CA initiatives. I have also included a copy of the newspaper articles from Saturday which indicate that the Feinstein initiative has been withdrawn.

I also have included a copy of the decision from the Montana court case which challenges the new state statute on campaign expenses. The bench trial has been set for May 18, 1998. I have forwarded the decision to Covington and Burling for analysis.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Dr. M. F. Gannon date: April 11, 1974
From: Noel Einolf
Subject: Mechanical Pumps on DuPont GC/MS 21-490

The present (Alcatel) direct drive mechanical
pumps on the DuPont 21-490 GC/MS have developed
problems either with the motors or with the pump
mechanisms. One of the two pumps has been repaired
twice, and has had a motor replaced one time.
The other pump was simply replaced with a new one
when it became noisy. Because of the problems en-
countered with these pumps within a period of only
a year, I suggest replacing them with conventional
belt-driven pumps.

The Edwards ED 200 pump would be suitable,
since it has a pumping speed slightly greater than
those it would replace. I have used an Edwards pump-
and found it to be quiet and require minimal mainten-
ance.

Mr. Bob Fuchs at DuPont agreed (verbally) to
allow us half value for the Alcatel pumps. Current
price for these is $475.00 each. The price of the
Edwards ED 200 pump is $680.00 each. Our cost would
be (2 x $680) - $475 = $885.00 for this changeover.
I would also buy a spare parts kit at $35.00.

I suggest ordering the Edwards pumps as soon as
possible because of the lead time of 12-14 weeks.

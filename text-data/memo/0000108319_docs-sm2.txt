SUBJECT: LOW ‘TAR’ FLAVOR - Final Focus Group Outputs

Attached is the R&D write-up on the final round of focus groups conducted on LTT concepts. These LTT concepts will now be prepared for third stage concept testing. Prior to initiating this testing we will set up a LTT project review meeting with you to discuss this project’s direction. Included in this review will be an update on the Low ‘Tar’ Satisfaction project which we see as merging with the Low ‘Tar’ Flavor product to form the core of candidates for Brand B.

Re: TELEX TO BE SENT FRIDAY, APRIL 1

Please send the following telex:

Telex No. 5 30 98

Mr. Jan Thierves
Theodorus Nijeneyer Ltd.
Groningen, Holland

Next scheduled shipment of HALF AND HALF is as follows:

Leave Richmond April 5 - ship loading April 6

Our moisture values for Code 12: Carton #1 - 15.0%
#2 - 15.3%
#3 - 14.7%
#4 - 15.0%
#5 - 16.2%
#6 - 14.5%

If your testing confirms moisture spread between cartons, would suggest
you blend cartons to even out moisture.

Our moisture values for Code 13: Carton #1 - 15.7%
#2 - 15.6%

As discussed, would suggest blending cut product which you are having
difficulty with in packing (volume) with new shipment. Would not recommend
attempting to add moisture or heat to tobacco. Would cause flavor
loss and breakage.

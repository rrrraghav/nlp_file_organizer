DATE: APRIL 7, 1982

SUBJECT: SMOKING, EXERCISE AND HIGH DENSITY CHOLESTEROL

Two articles on the subject have appeared recently with contradictory conclusions. On February 14, the Courier-Journal described a U of L study by Bryant Stanford who said that people who exercise have higher HDL levels than non-exercisers but smoking cancels out this effect. On the other hand, a Japanese researcher, S. Nakamura, reports that HDL levels were found significantly higher in both smoking and non-smoking exercisers compared to sedentary smokers.

Corporate affairs may wish to inform the Courier-Journal of the Japanese study.

HISTORY

A two year plan was approved by SAB in October 1973
at a level of $40,000. Application (dated July 10,
1974) requested $60,285 and was considered as first
year renewal (No. 57/2CR). This was altered and
considered as a new application (No. 1011) at the
October 1974 SAB meeting.

The application was approved by the SAB subject to
determination by the Scientific Director as to
priority and budget. Also approved was a new
contract proposal ($30,000) for Kouri-Levy collaboration (see attachments)
for animal holding and breeding studies to determine
whether xenotropic virus/AHH segregate in mouse-
breeding studies.

At a later staff meeting the Scientific Director
recommended that No. 1011 and the contract be deferred
until the following year's budget.

Also recommended was $10,000 pro rate to Levy for
continuation of his studies to March 31, 1975
(i.e. three month extension).

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Dr. Fritz Will, III Date: December 29, 1970

From: D. C. Watson

Subject: Expanded Tobacco Monthly Summary - December, 1970

Routine determinations continue on impregnated and
expanded NH3/CO2 treated tobacco. A second TC detector
and power supply has been received to help decrease the
turn-around time on samples.

This unit has been temporarily modified for
determinations of H2 in the expansion tower effluent gases.
The limit of detection for H2 in the gas is about 20 ppm.

Preliminary results on computer output for the CO2
analyses indicate a significant time saving and increased
accuracy.

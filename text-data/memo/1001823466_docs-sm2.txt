subject: Review of Manuscript - "Influence des Proprietes de Surface des
Charbons sur la Filtration de la Fumee de Cigarettes" by
C. Jeanneer, U. Nyfieller, C. Mayor, M.-F. Sauser



This paper has been reviewed in detail and I have the following
comments to make:

In terms of scientific merit, this paper is not a significant
contribution. However, it has been presented previously at
CORESTA and, in our opinion, does not deal with any material
detrimental to our company’s business. It does not do much to
improve the scientific image of our company. However, there
is every reason to believe it is scientifically accurate.

As with many publications, the title promises more than is
delivered in the paper. The title leads one to expect to learn
what the effects of the properties of carbon have on cigarette
smoke filtered through carbon. The major portion of the paper
deals with a description of the properties of carbon with only
limited information on the effect of charcoal on cigarette smoke
(analysis of cysteine). In addition, it is not clear what specific
type of charcoal was the final subject of their study.

A major weak point relates to tables 1 and 2. The last entries
in these tables refer to the heat of absorption of the two char-
coals studied. The figures reflect results from two different
methods of measurement. This looks differ significantly to
which only a passing reference is made.

There should be an explanation or at least speculation as to why
these figures differ. I believe the authors in other work on heat
of absorption of charcoal have made direct calorimetric measure-
ments. Reference could be made to this point and results from
such studies used to explain the differences in the tabulated
measurements.

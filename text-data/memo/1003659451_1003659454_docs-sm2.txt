RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

From: G. Vilcins
Subject: Accomplishments, 1981: CIGARETTE SMOKE STUDIES

PROJECT #1752

1) Air Quality Study in Smoker and Nonsmoker Homes

The air quality study comparing smoker and nonsmoker NO₂ concentrations in their homes was completed. The study revealed that smoking contributed a small but definite increase in NO₂ levels in the home. However, this contribution was minor compared to other sources generating NO₂, such as gas stoves, gas ovens, and automobiles.

2) Quantitative Analysis of Polyvinyl Acetate on Cigarette Seams

An infrared procedure was developed to determine the amount of polyvinyl acetate adhesive on a single seam of a cigarette.

3) Dynamic Filter Dilution Study

A system consisting of a tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDI), automatic pressure control unit, smoke collection and analysis chamber, and a MINC-23 computer has been assembled and tested for the dynamic filter dilution study.

The software for the data collection and the control of the sampling system has been completed.

4) Support to Manufacturing

Large number of infrared identifications were made of the chemical compositions of materials used and proposed for use in cigarette manufacturing. Assistance was provided in several problems involving cigarette “blocking” and spotting.

5) Generation of Reference Library

Programs were developed to maintain and update reference library of infrared spectra for tobacco components and cigarette flavors isolated and synthesized by the Organic Synthesis Group.

DATE: MAY 8, 1995

What follows are the methodology statement, key findings, and summary for our recent survey of New York City Full Service Restaurants conducted for the National Smokers Alliance. A complete copy of the survey instrument with aggregate responses and demographic data are attached.

Methodology Statement

This survey of attitudes was conducted among Restaurant Owners and/or Managers of Full Service Restaurants in New York City between May 3 and May 6, 1995. All interviews were conducted via telephone by professionally trained personnel. Respondents were randomly selected from lists of known Full Service Restaurants in New York City. Interviews were targeted geographically to reflect the restaurant distribution throughout the five boroughs. This survey of 1,000 Full Service Restaurant Owners and/or Managers has an accuracy of +/- 3.1% at the 95% confidence interval.

Key Findings

* Fully 91.3% of Restaurateurs state that in the past their customers have been generally satisfied with the accommodation of having a smoking and non-smoking section in their restaurants.

* Virtually all Restaurateurs (98.1%) are aware of the new smoking ban that went into effect in April.

DOD shows very little difference between the 3 and 4 digit military vehicle
identifiers. The current a837259 concept is to use 3 digits as opposed
to 4 digits.

The differences between the 3 and 4 digit vehicle identifiers are signal length.
(3-digit) is 19 characters & width, (4-digit) is 20 characters & width. Military
vehicle identifier is a number that identifies a specific military vehicle.
Reasons for the 3/4 character difference are the subsequent requirements.

We are attaching our report on the physical properties and smoke analysis for
PAIL. MAIL cigarettes made at Redville Branch on April 13, 1972 from tobacco
which had been dried in the Jetstream Dryer. These cigarettes were made at
85 and 101 cigarettes per pound.

The Jetstream dried tobacco is shorter than the control tobacco and contained
somewhat more "thru & thru" tobacco. Otherwise, the physical properties of the
cigarettes are essentially the same as those of the control cigarettes.
There is no difference between the filling power of the control tobacco and
that of the Jetstream dried tobacco.

Smoke analyses for the three (3) lots of cigarettes are normal.

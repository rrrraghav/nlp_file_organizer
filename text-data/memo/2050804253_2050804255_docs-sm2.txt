Industry Research Concept/Research Council Smoking & Health

The term of office of the 4th Research Council expires in 1990.
WPA discussed considerations on the re-formation and research
objectives of the future Research Council. There was unanimity
that the Research Council in its existing composition and
objectives is defined too narrowly for the current problems and
that therefore the remit of the next Research Council should be
formulated more widely and not only specifically tobacco industry
oriented. There was also unanimity on the fact that the existing
period of office of the Research Council of 3 years is too short.
There were adverse comments by WPA on the legal status of a
foundation, introduced into the discussion by Prof. A.
A working group dealing with the future Research Council and
consisting of Messrs. Will (PMG), Konig (VDC), Herter (BAT) and
Wickmann (REE) came at its first meeting to the conclusion that
the person of Prof. Thurau is of particular importance in the
formation of the next Research Council.

Note :

A paper about the 1990 Research Council, elaborated by U. Beecken
and W. Fink for G. Wille, regards the elaboration of the
scientific principle of the importance of endogenic exposure vs.
exogenic exposure for the main tasks of the new
Research council. Collaboration of the industries concerned in a
"rota industry" Research Council should be possible on this
basis.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Mr. J. Gibson Date: December 5, 1984

From: W. F. Gammon

Subject: Japan Prototypes

While I have written nothing formally concerning telephone conversation
in question, the attached memo from R. L. Snyder adequately summarizes
the situation. While several people in Asia are copied, this fax
will arrive in time for your N.P.C. meeting whereas the actual copies
may not.

Please note that we have not as yet resolved the question of testing
an 80 mm Marlboro prototype cited in R. Snyder’s point two.
Additionally, the timing for development and testing of prototypes
(last paragraph) appears unrealistic.

Will look forward to receiving feedback on discussions of your
N.P.C. meeting.

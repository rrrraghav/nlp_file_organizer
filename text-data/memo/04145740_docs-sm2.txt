Lorillard

MEMORANDUM 28 March, 1983

TO: Walter Thompson
FROM: Laura Vogel
RE: Consumer Consumption and Switching Rates

AVERAGE DAILY CONSUMPTION RATE

For 1982, smokers of the major Lorillard brands (Newport, Newport Lights, Kent, Golden Lights, Kent III, and True) smoke an average of 34.1 cigarettes per day. This figure takes reported consumption rates and actual sales volume into account.

ONE-YEAR SWITCHING RATES

The proportion of those switching out of each brand “family” during 1982 is as follows (excludes switching to line extensions of same brand):

Newport     4.6
Newport Lights   7.3
Kent      9.1
Golden Lights  10.6
Kent III    2.9
True       10.1

The switching rate out of Kent III was extremely high during 1981 (14.4%) because of large losses to Barclay, which was introduced early that year.

If you have any questions, please call.

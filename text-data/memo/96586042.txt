SUBJECT: ADVERTISING – Excel P-1 Combination Plan

Currently, there are chains that have a policy that will not
allow cigarette companies to place permanent cigarette
advertising in their stores.

In a few chains, the competition has waived their advertising
requirements for one reason or another.

The merchandising department needs to have all of the
necessary information that pertains to both of these chain
situations.

On the attached survey forms I’ve asked that each of these
questions be answered pertaining to the specific chains in
your area assignments that fit these circumstances.

Please complete the attached survey forms and return by E-
Mail to my attention by October 31, 1997.

MEMORANDUM

March 15, 1991

TO: Sheila Consul

FROM: Peter G. Sparber

RE: Speakers Bureau Procedures

It is important that the Consortium speakers bureau be well
managed and focused from the start. Al and Brenda strongly
recommended that we draft procedures and Phyllis and I concur.
To that end, we have attached proposed procedures.

We do not plan to discuss them at Tuesday's meeting but would
like to share this draft with Al and Brenda fairly soon
thereafter.

We also need to discuss the project with F-H to ensure
coordination with Jolly Ann’s tours.

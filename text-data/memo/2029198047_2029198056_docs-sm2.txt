OBJECTIVE

To carry out an interlaboratory comparison of the determination of MH-30 by HPLC [1] and to compare HPLC figures with results obtained by the standard colorimetric method ISO-4876.

PARTICIPATING LABORATORIES

The following five laboratories took part to the study:

PM-USA (CPA Laboratory) : HPLC method
PM-USA2 (S.S. Yang) : HPLC method
PM-Europe : HPLC method
Universal Leaf Tobacco : HPLC method
INIFo : ISO-4876

SAMPLES

Tobacco samples containing MH-30 at five different levels ranging from 40 to 110 ppm were selected. For each level, six replicate analyses were carried out. The tests were analyzed over two days as described in the note accompanying the samples [2].

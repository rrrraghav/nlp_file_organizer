Subject: Proposal for Professor Richard Zallen to Study Sol-Gel Process for Coatings

Attached is a proposal which I solicited from Dr. Dick Zallen of VPI-
Physics to study coatings and films by the Sol-gel process. It is intended
that Dr. Andy Kallianos will work in Dr. Zallen’s lab in an effort to make
uniform Sol-gel coatings of oxides and refractory coatings on paper fibers.
The objective of the work is to develop an PM process for refractory papers
which are badly needed for the Sidestream and Delta programs.

The proposal is a modest one but I have great confidence in Dr.
Zallen’s scientific ability in this area. I strongly recommend we support
this effort. This work did not appear on the 1988 original budget but can
be supported out of the unused Visiting Scientist budget.

Please let me have your comments on this proposal.

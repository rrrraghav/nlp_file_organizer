Subject: VICEROY Rich Lights Pack Copy Substantiation

The VICEROY Brand Group has selected the name "VICEROY Rich
Lights" for the new 9 mg. ‘tar’ product we will be introducing
nationally in May. In conjunction with the name, we have developed
a pack design which contains the copy

LOW 'TAR' · ENRICHED TOBACCO

on one face panel and

‘Tar’ 9 mg. nicotine 0.7 mg.
average per cigarette

on the opposite face panel.

The VICEROY Brand Group has been requested to furnish our Legal
Department a written statement substantiating the claims:

1) LOW 'TAR' (i.e., the product will be low ‘tar’ by virtue of
it being single digit)

2) ENRICHED TOBACCO

3) Ability to control the ‘tar’ and nicotine data

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
Richmond, Virginia

To: Kevin Osborne Date: October 27, 1994
From: Sue Tafur and Ken Newman
Subject: Status of PM1659 and PM1660

We feel it is appropriate that patent applications be pursued for aqueous sol-gel materials for low sidestream papers. PM1659 and PM1660 should have active status and the drafted applications should be completed and filed. Although PM is not currently planning to commercialize these materials or papers made from them, we think that the invention which has been achieved/obtained should be aggressively protected. PM1659 and PM1660 cover novel compositions made by a novel process which has been investigated through pilot scale synthesis and machine-made papers and cigarettes. We believe that both of these inventions are feasible for commercial scale-up.

We also think that it is appropriate at this time for the two inventions on the methanol-solvent mediated materials (PM-1397 and PM1494) to be in an inactive state.

Re: Payment To Battelle Laboratories
For Inhalation Toxicity Studies

We have received an invoice from Battelle Pacific
Northwest Laboratories covering costs invoiced for the
month of January 1990. A copy of the invoice is enclosed for your
information. The total amount due for this invoice is
$15,010.28. Allocating this amount in accordance with the
agreed percentage allocations for dividing the costs of the
study result in the following:

Philip Morris 25.00% $ 3,752.57
Reynolds 25.00% 3,752.57
B&W 14.874% 2,232.63
American 14.874% 2,232.63
Lorillard 14.874% 2,232.63
Liggett 5.378% 807.25

100.00% $ 15,010.28

I would appreciate receiving from each of you a
check, payable to Covington & Burling and mailed directly to
me, in the amount for which your company is responsible.

Ash of Commercial Cigarettes

At a recent meeting discussing the use of salt casings on cigarettes for controlling delivery, the subject of ash in our competitive cigarettes was discussed. The attached memos (R.P. Kuhn to Dr. R. M. Ikeda, “Emission Spectrographic Analyses of Ashed Cigarette Filler,” September 30, 1968 and H. M. Stahr to R. M. Ikeda, “Ash on Cigarette Filler,” September 30, 1968) I believe will be of interest to you.

In addition, I have averaged the ash data and ranked the cigarettes tested (see Table I).

The information presented in these two memos does not lead to or support the conclusion that other companies are using salt casings. However, this information does not eliminate that possibility either.

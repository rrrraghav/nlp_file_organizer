MEMORANDUM

TO: Patrick Donoho
V.P. Tobacco Institute

FROM: John Chwat

DATE: February 21, 1997

It was a pleasure talking with you about our mutual efforts to extend our clients special interests throughout the United States. And, I appreciate the opportunity to tell you about an exciting project we developed for the National Licensed Beverage Association (NLBA). When we spoke, I mentioned that our firm has taken the lead, on behalf of the NLBA, to establish new NLBA state affiliates and to build their membership. The name of this project is Campaign 2000. Because of our contacts within the hospitality industry, we have been very successful in our efforts to establish new state affiliates. At the beginning of Campaign 2000 (July 1, 1995), the NLBA represented 18 states. As of the first of January '97, they represent 29 states. And, we have 8 other states in various stages of the NLBA affiliation process. I’ll give you a run-down for each state, later in this memo.

While we have added approximately 2,000 new members to the NLBA rolls, the pace of membership recruitment has been less than meteoric. As you can imagine, the membership recruitment portion of Campaign 2000 is pick-and-shovel work that requires people and rules. Typically, our new state affiliates have a small cadre of people, but understandably, no start-up funds. It’s bit of a Catch-22 situation. Despite my limited budget, I try to help where I can with brochures, literature and press releases. However, mailing lists, labels, postage, design work for state affiliate logo's and application forms, are often beyond the new state affiliates financial capability. Accordingly, they are only able to do a limited amount of membership recruitment. While I organize groups to speed-up the next several months, I remain concerned that the existing pace may not be in position to fully exploit a recent development that will make NLBA membership especially attractive to retailers who offer music (live or recorded) and other store wide events.

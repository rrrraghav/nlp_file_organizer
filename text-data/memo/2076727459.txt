FM R&D, Chris Campbell's group, has requested DDF using a UHF core. This is an extension of their recent work involving DDF.



These filter designs have been developed to evaluate the idea that the taste of a cigarette can be improved if the "core" smoke, i.e., that smoke coming from the core of the tobacco rod, can be removed. The R&D smoke chemists feel the outer portion of tobacco smoke has a better taste.





Their DDF designs are such that the filter core filters the core smoke. They do not want a filter core so dense that no smoke will enter it (a.g., COP) and therefore join with the outside smoke as it passes through the filter in the outer section.





In the CA/CA DDF designs they wanted to achieve a 70/30 split in "partial" filtration between the outer and inner sections. The UHF/CA DDF proposed design take this idea a step further. Please look at the possibility of providing UHF/CA (inner/outer) DDF samples. If it would help us, they are willing to look at hand-made samples to make a preliminary evaluation.

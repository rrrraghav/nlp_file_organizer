MEMORANDUM

TO: DR. I. W. HUGHES

FROM: TOM HUMBER

DATE: OCTOBER 15, 1982

Mike Scott is a woking public affairs man and D.A.T representive at the T.A.C. Because the T.A.C. is pushing to implement programs similar to those of II spokesperson, issue advertising, TAN - Scott requested permission to visit II for a briefing.

After talking with Scott and Bob Ely, I concluded that it would be better for him to come here to get a more balanced view from Mr. Wells, Mr. Russell and me. I insisted, however, that his request for the visit be handled through the official channels, which you should be receiving shortly.

I believe the visit will be useful to him and will give us an opportunity to have at least one voice at the T.A.C. with a realistic appraisal of II programs.



T.H.

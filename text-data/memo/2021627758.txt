Processing of Idea No. 127 - Jet Stream Cigarette Filter

Abstract

A modification of the present recessed filter was suggested which should increase the impaction of the smoke by a nozzle throttling effect.

Investigation:

The opinion of several people was that this filter would not sufficiently increase the filtration efficiency of the recessed filter. The "modern name" of the filter was termed as being very excellent.

Recommendations:

It was recommended this idea be turned over to Mr. Super for further evaluation in his filter program.

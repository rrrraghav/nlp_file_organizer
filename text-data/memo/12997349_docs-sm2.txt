Rel APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION: CARLITON ASSAULT W-3 EXPANSION

The following proposal recommends funding an expansion of the CARLITON Assault effort to Section W-3. Total estimated costs are $1,920,000.

BACKGROUND

The CARLITON Assault is a fully integrated effort with all the key elements (Advertising, Direct and Promotion) focused to create maximum pressure against the retail environment and competitive smokers. It is a swift and powerful program designed to build business and capture share.

The Assault program is a strategic tool reserved for highly developed growth opportunity areas -- success breeds success. To achieve full impact, we continue to believe a full year of activity is required. Thereafter, the Assault strategy moves on to another strong area.

Section W-3 is our strongest CARLITON area with a 145 SDI (2.29 share). W-3 represents 6.64% of population and, more importantly, 9.61% of CARLITON sales.

W-3 is also scheduled to participate in the 1992 Future Bold expansion which will provide added S/C support.

CONNECTICUT ASSAULT RESULTS

MSA, which covers the entire store universe, is showing a positive CARLITON share trend. Due to shipment volatility, we are examining three month moving shares.

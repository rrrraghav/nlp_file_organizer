MEMORANDUM

TO: Sam Chilcote

FROM: Susan Stuntz

The Wisconsin Lung Association recently wrote to television and
radio stations in the state urging that the Consortium/TI PSAs not
be shown in the state. A copy of the letter is attached, along
with a wire story that ran on the letter.

We see an opportunity to respond and in the process enhance the
visibility of the program in the state. We propose writing the
president of the state ALA chapter and challenge him to defend his
allegations that the program is designed to increase tobacco use
among young people. At the same time that we send that letter, we
also would release to the media in the state a copy of the letter,
along with a challenge that the author publicly debate his charges
with Consortium and TI representatives.

Copies of the draft letter, and a news advisory, are also attached
for your review. With your approval, we’ll get this project off
the ground.

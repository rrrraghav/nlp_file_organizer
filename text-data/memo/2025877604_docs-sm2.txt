MEMORANDUM

TO: Members of the Executive Committee

FR: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

RE: 1985 Surgeon General’s Report
SS
GS
This memorandum and its attachment will advise you of
early steps we are taking to meet this year's Surgeon General’s
report, which we expect in November, and of the nature of its
anticipated contents. Please regard this information as
confidential.

In the days since we received this information, and in
collaboration with our legal counsel, our staff has begun
gathering prior publications on similar subjects by the
prospective authors of the report chapters. This will enable us
to forecast the conclusions of the report with some degree of
accuracy, and to develop "shadow" papers among scientists who may
dispute such conclusions.

Because of the international publicity which usually
attends U.S. Surgeon General’s reports, we have provided this
advance information to INFOTAB and to our counterpart
associations in Germany, U.K., Canada and Australia.

In addition, we are in touch with a prospective
consultant firm which has computerized capacity to perform
analyses similar to those contemplated in the report's Chapter
XIII, and this may enable us to forecast the conclusions in that
chapter.

I will keep you informed of relevant developments.

Attachment

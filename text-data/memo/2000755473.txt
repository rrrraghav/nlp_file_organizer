Progress Report - Period November 16 - 30, 1952:
Separation and Determination of Added Non-Tobacco Constituents.

1. Accomplishments. None.

2. Activities. During the course of work on the preparation of a new calibration curve for ethyl alcohol, it was found that the stability of the p-hydroxyphenyl solution had a marked effect on the values obtained from the Klett Colorimeter readings.
All new solutions were prepared and the p-hydroxyphenyl was freshly prepared prior to usage. Samples containing 4, 6, 14 and 18 gamma/cc of alcohol were prepared, oxidized, distilled, developed using the freshly prepared p-hydroxyphenyl solution, and read on the Klett Colorimeter.

The values obtained from the set of known alcohol samples gave a curve which followed Beer’s Law.

Having obtained a valid calibration curve the amount of ethyl alcohol present in tobacco samples taken over a period of 72 hours from the cooler to the saratoga was calculated.

3. Plans for Action. An exhaustive extraction will be made on a sample of tobacco from the roaster. A known amount of alcohol will be added, and up to 200 milliliters of extract will be analyzed.

Investigation of tobacco smoke for the quantitative detection of acrolein will be started.

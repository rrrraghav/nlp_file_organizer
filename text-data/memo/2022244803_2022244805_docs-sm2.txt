This meeting took place on 1/18/72. The following is not a detailed transcript
of the discussion, but merely notes regarding quotations made by various people.

Gori: Believes the closeness of industry makes it reasonable to suppose that
even the tobacco industry could have a contract with NCI to make a safer
cigarette.

Gori: Believes the need for inhalation method as a step closer to human
experience than skin painting. He outlined the plan of the proposed Auerbach
smoking dogs test as follows: The purpose is to establish long-term chronic
effects of nicotine on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of dogs.
“We are not looking for cancer effects.” For this purpose they will use two
samples of cigarettes: 1) an SBB-like blend made for Agricultural Research
Service, grown low nicotine bright and burley tobaccos and oriental tobaccos
obtained from Italy through the auspices of the Italian Monopoly (D.R. N.
Carraro). A blend of these tobaccos is supposed to produce a cigarette con-
taining 0.2 to 0. % nicotine. Sample No. 2 is a high nicotine tobacco which
would be the same blend of tobaccos as used for the low nicotine cigarette,
but with nicotine tartrate or nicotine citrate added to increase the nicotine
content.

The plan is to use only two groups of dogs. He has no plans to use non-
smoking dog control.

Bates: Questioned the wisdom of doing experiment without adequate controls.

Gori: Defended this decision by saying previous experience shows what would
happen to the controls. He argues there is no need to repeat that part of the
experiment.

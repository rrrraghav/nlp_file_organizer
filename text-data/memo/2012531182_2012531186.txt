Here are my thoughts concerning the Leo Burnett "To Smokers Only" campaign, as compared with our “Ease Up” campaign.

1. Headline.

In general four to five times as many people read the headline and signature of an ad as read the body copy.
This is based on years of ratings of ads by Daniel Starch Associates (which can be checked). My recollection is that roughly 25% “see” an ad (that is, their eyes observe the page), 20% "note" (that is, they read the headline and note the logotype to see who said the headline) and 5% "read most" (that is, they read the body copy).

An ad, therefore, that communicates a message in a headline versus one that communicates only in the body copy is about four to five times as powerful in terms of dollar-efficiency. It reaches more people -- four to five times more -- and at much lower cost.

If we compare the ads on this basis, we get four to five times more people reading:

"When you light up, ease up.

And enjoy our cigarettes more.

Phillip Morris Incorporated."

as will read the body copy on --

“To smokers only.

Phillip Morris Incorporated.”

DATE: November 8, 1976

Per your request, the following will serve to highlight the sales plan in the KOOL-Naturals test market (Little Rock, Arkansas, Trading Area #40) as it pertains to FACT. Attached is a complete copy of the KOOL test market sales plan which was issued by Sales Planning. However, in the following paragraphs please find highlighted the plan as it relates to the FACT brand.

The sales plan was issued on June 14, 1976 after a myriad of discussions between the KOOL Group and the FACT Brand Group. It was decided that the Sales Department was not to initiate any FACT retail work until November 1, 1976. (See page 1 of sales plan.) It was further specified, on pages 2 and 4 of the work plan, that the following parameters would be used for FACT retail work:

FACT Retail Work

Until the week after the carton coupon drop (11/11/’76), Sales Representatives will not carry any FACT cigarettes or displays. The only effort by Sales Representatives on FACT prior to 11/11/’76 will be nominal.

- In stores where FACT has been authorized, Sales Representatives
will order it from the store's supplier.

- In stores where FACT has been received, Sales Representatives
will find it a “zone” on carton/package racks and limit promotional
activity to shelf talkers and logo tabs.

Beginning November 1, 1976, every effort should be made to secure FACT distribution and display advertising in prime locations. No FACT local adver-
tising or coupon drops are scheduled for the Little Rock Trading Area.

The above sales plan was developed and issued to our Field Force and was,
naturally, designed to mitigate all conflicting KOOL competitive activity in the
Little Rock area so that the KOOL Naturals test market readings could be ac-
curately seen.

The salesmen were provided with the following materials on FACT:

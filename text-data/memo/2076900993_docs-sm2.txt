PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK 10017-5592

TO: All Philip Morris Employees DATE: June 16, 1995

FROM: Geoff Bible

As a follow-up to my memo of June 9th regarding a misleading and inaccurate article that was published last week in The New York Times, I wanted to share with you a copy of a letter sent to The New York Times yesterday from Jim Morgan, President and CEO of Philip Morris U.S.A., setting the record straight. In addition, we have widely distributed Jim’s letter to the general media.

We will continue to vigorously defend all our businesses against distorted and biased reporting.

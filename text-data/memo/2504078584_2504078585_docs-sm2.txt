Subject: Summary of Paper: "Smoking-related Beliefs and
Behaviour of South Australians with Diabetes"

An article with the above title was published in the Australian Journal of Public
Health, vol 19, no. 3 in 1995.

The article makes the following comments:

• that of 289 diabetics studied, 20.8% were smokers, 32.8% ex smokers and
46.4% were non-smokers;

• that for diabetic respondents under 40 (classified as "younger people" in this
study) smoking prevalence was 54.7%;

• that for diabetic respondents 40 years old and over, 14.5% were smokers;

• that smoking prevalence for diabetics under 40 years was significantly higher
than for non-diabetic respondents in that age group;

• that the above finding is reversed for respondents over 40 years of age;

• that the following reasons have been suggested for young diabetics smoking:
difficulties and frustrations in dealing with their chronic condition;
and
to keep weight off (weight control is emphasised in self-management for
diabetics);

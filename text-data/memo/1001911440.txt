Analysis of House Respiratory Rate Data

The analysis performed consisted of ten single-classification
analyses of variance for differences in per cent decrease in
respiratory rate for the cigarettes. One such analysis was
performed for each set of measurements at the five different
times and the two different puff volumes.

The F-test ratios for these tests were as follows:

10mm Puff 50mm Puff

15 seconds .61 2.86*
30 seconds 1.72 6.33*
45 seconds 1.41 4.40*
60 seconds 2.40* 5.74*
1 minute after 1.67 4.46*
exposure

*significant at 5% level

A separation of means revealed the following individual
differences between cigarettes in those groups in which over-
all significant differences were found: (Any two means not
included in the same bracket are significantly different. Any
two means [included in the same bracket are not significantly
different.]

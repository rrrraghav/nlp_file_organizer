PHILIP MORRIS INCORPORATED E. L. DAYLOR

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE JAN 19 1968

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Mr. F. L. Daylor Date: January 18, 1968
From: R. B. Seligman
Subject: Charcoal Filter Cigarēt

A major breakthrough in cigaret flavoring would be the development of a charcoal filtered cigaret which cannot be differentiated from one which contains no charcoal in the filter. I feel this deserves serious consideration as it may be the only way by which we can save one of our brands.

Please let me have your comments.

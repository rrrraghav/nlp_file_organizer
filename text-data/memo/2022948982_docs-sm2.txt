INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
Richmond, Virginia

To: Those Listed Date: February 4, 1992
From: D. Leyden (7802)
Subject: 1993-1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee

The membership of the 1993-1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee was generated by consultation with R&D management and management outside R&D. Those listed have been selected to serve on this committee. I hope to contact most of you by telephone before you receive this memorandum to discuss with you the goals and plans of the committee. If I have not been able to do so, please accept my apologies.

A meeting of the R&D Strategic Planning Committee will be held within the next one or two weeks to begin our important work for the coming year. I realize how difficult it is to schedule meetings for such a large group, and the realities are that any individual cannot attend each meeting we have during the year. However, I strongly urge you to attend the first meeting because a number of organizational issues and goals will be discussed. Please arrange a substitute when possible for future meetings.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

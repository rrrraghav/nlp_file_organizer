WTS samples obtained in several ongoing projects have been analyzed in RD&E. The results of these comparisons are shown in the attached Table 1. The four basic groupings of stem are:

1) WTS made from common-lot raw stems, 50/50 burley/flue-cured,
processed by both Macon and Beneux.

2) WTS made from common-lot raw stem, flue-cured only, processed
by B&W in the Development Center and BAT – UK&E.

3) WTS made from common-lot raw stem, flue-cured only, processed
by B&W in the Development Center, and WD&HO Wills - Australia.

4) WTS made from a 70/30 flue-cured/burley mix in S. T. Oy –
Finland.

Details of processing are shown in an attachment.

In every case that common lot materials have been used, B&W’s
optimized process appears to give the best physical quality. The
Finnish product appears to be acceptable, though the results would not
appear to indicate improvement over B&W standards.

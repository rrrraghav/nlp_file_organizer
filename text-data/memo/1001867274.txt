Subject: HTI Weekly Status Report

Please note the following changes since last week:

Real Tests 7023/10047 and 7024/10048 have been cancelled.

The Beta cigarettes for Numbers 5050/7036, 5051/7037,
5052/7038 and 5053/7039 will not be released to HTI until
VP test results for the same cigarettes have been received.

Two Marlboro Lights 100’s and 85’s tests (5054/5055 and
1236/1237) have been requested: flavor 1X versus 2 and
production versus flavor 1X.

Marlboro 100’s 10% dilution test (2371/2372) has been
closed. Results indicate a breakeven.

B&H 100’s Lights Regular tests results indicate a breakeven
with Kent Golden Lights 100’s and a directional loss to
Merit 100’s possibly caused by cork versus white tipping
paper.

B&H 100’s Lights Menthol is beating Salem Long Lights
significantly.

SUBJECT: BARCLAY BUY ONE ENJOY ONE FREE PROMOTION EVALUATION

Background

BARCLAY employed a Buy One Enjoy One Free 'deal' as an introductory offer to consumers in test market and in the balance of the U.S. Subjective evaluation indicated excellent consumer acceptance of the offer. The Brand Group is considering the re-use of this promotional device in 1982 as a means of increasing competitive trial.

Objective

The objective of this research is to determine the amount of competitive trial achieved by the Buy One Enjoy One Free program.

Methodology

Eighteen retail outlets equally divided between Kansas City and Indianapolis ran the promotion on Saturday and Sunday, May 16 and 17 and on Tuesday and Wednesday, May 20 and 21. These outlets were further divided between type of outlet (i.e., supermarket, small grocery and drug store) and BARCLAY share for each store (high volume, middle volume, and low volume). Interviewers were present in these stores throughout the day intercepting shoppers to the promotion and recording the desired information. The displays and packs were locked up and inaccessible to consumers while the interviewer was not present.

Subject: Bi-weekly Summary

Heater / Lighter Development:

Heater Development:
* PM 50 and PM 80 were received and tested for heater creep. We saw no significant improvement of mechanical stability under heating. ORNL is looking into their ability to enhance the stability by heat treating. In addition, we are trying our own tests using ovens available at R&D.

* An alternative strategy to increasing the strength of the heater material, at elevated temperatures, is to investigate the feasibility of lowering the heater operating temperature (creep is extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature) while maintaining the required heat transfer to the cigarette (thus minimizing subjective character). We have identified the required energy profile to attain a constant temperature for a given heater. This energy profile will be tested for subjective impact once the virtual lighter is complete.

* Ceramix sleeve testing is in progress. The sleeves are functioning as expected.

* We have received carbon-impregnated acetate sleeves from AFC. These will be used to assess the replaceable condensate control system.

Lighter Development:
Fifteen lighters were brought back from Sanyo. Some minor problems with heater shorts and flow sensors occurred. These are now being corrected. All heaters will be disassembled and flow tubes reversed to improve subjectives. During the disassembly the heaters will be inspected for potential shorts and fixed as needed.

* The BFL (Big Flexible Lighter) now has the capability of monitoring heater profile. We are developing the ability to modulate the energy to the heater.

Energy Storage:
A simple simulation of heater temperature dynamics has been initiated using a commercial software package. With it’s use, results of various power modulation schemes can be easily visualized. Incorporation of a more rigorous heater model from A. D. Little into the simulation is being pursued.

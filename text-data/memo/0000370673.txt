TITLE: EFFECT OF CTO ON MENTHOL PRODUCTS/354

AUTHOR: D. V. Cantrell

DATE: May 7, 1984

This note summarizes past menthol development work in which CTO was
examined.  Several CTO/blend improvement projects were
begun with the purpose to develop improvement candidates having less
harshness and a better tobacco taste.

CTO was examined in these projects because work with ARTES had shown
it to be a means of reducing harshness and enhancing tobacco taste
(see attached).

Shown below in Table 1 are our subjective assessments of CTO vs. R&D
with KOOL and BELAIR.

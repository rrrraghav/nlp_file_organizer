INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Dr. G. E. Inskeep Dated: January 14, 1971
From: R. A. Tamol, & F. Meyer
Subject: Review of Revised Patent Application - PM #534

We have reviewed the subject patent application and our comments
and questions are as follows:

1. Pages 6, 7, 10 and Claim #3........
Molecular weight range should be to 600,000 instead of
300,000 AS MN 3000 is approximately 600,000.

2. Page 7, line 9........
Change N-750 to N-3000.

3. Page 7........
What does Patent #3,154,514 (line 24) cover? Manufacture
of Tergitol by Carbide or is this use of Tergitol as a
plasticizer? Note conversations by Howard Kothe
with Carbide regarding use of Tergitol in our formulation.
It is described in our examples. Any problem anticipated
here?

4. Page 11, beginning at line 14........
The description of a dilution measuring device is
irrelevant when describing the smoke machine. This section
needs revision.

5. Page 6, line 16
Can we include Klucel (hydroxypropyl cellulose), CMC and PVP
(polyvinyl pyrrolidone) here is we are investigating TPM
with respect to a Polyox replacement that should include
peroxide attack.

SUBJECT: COMPARISON OF BSC, FTC AND TTIL DATA FROM THE 24TH MARKET SAMPLE

We have received the FTC data for the 24th Market Sample (purchased
October - November 1979). A comparison was made between B&W and
TTIL smoke delivery data on raw brands. The B&W data were from the
smoking of a duplicate sample provided to us by TTIL. The FTC
results are the first generated by the FTC on their new carbon monoxide
smoke machine. The TTIL data is from their retest of the 20th Market
Sample using the FTC type carbon monoxide smoke machine. Table I
summarizes the smoke delivery data at all three (3) laboratories for
B&W brand. B&W average tar delivery data shows good agreement as
compared to FTC and TTIL data.

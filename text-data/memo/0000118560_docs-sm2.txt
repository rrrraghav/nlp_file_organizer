FROM W. L. WRIGHT DATE February 12, 1979
SUBJECT VICEROY RICH LIGHTS NATIONAL TRACKING MONITOR WAVE III UPDATE:

On Friday, 2/9/79, I received instructions to cancel Wave III
of the VRL Monitor with Sahahan Research Associates. Currently,
contacts are being made with other suppliers to conduct the
tracking monitor.

As far as timing is concerned, it is hoped that the data can be
made available around the "last of March" date that was re-
quested by Senior Management. At this point in time, however,
dates cannot be pinpointed for sure. Every effort will be made
to field the research and obtain the data as soon as possible.

Will keep you appraised of any new developments.

REF: News Article

FYI, follows attached an article published today at “O Estado de São Paulo” about the action moved against Souza Cruz which first articles I’ve sent you yesterday.

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Souza Cruz will win in a second instance, considering that "manufacturing cigarettes is a legal activity”. Advertising and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes manufacturing activity even more legitimate.” One of the lawyers who has been consulted (Dr. Celso Bastos) also added that “this decision is clearly oriented by US influence".

An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Ceidídio) questioned "how it could be possible to determine if the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life?", and still complemented by saying that "if the person started to smoke as a kid, his parents should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also provoke heart attacks".

Only one attorney believes that "if it could be proven that the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz and that his death was really a consequence of the smoking habit, the cause of effect relation would then be a fact." This same attorney considered, at the other hand, these proves difficult to be obtained.

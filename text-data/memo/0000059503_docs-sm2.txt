DATE: JUNE 10, 1981

SUBJECT: WTS BURN RATE REDUCTION

The previous samples (160001-160009) with 2-3% burn retardants on WTS
failed to change the puff number of RALEIGH KS. We want to evaluate
these and additional retardants at 2-3 times the previous level.

Please make 50 castings of each of the following to RALEIGH KS
specifications using factory RALEIGH KS strip blend (cased) and factory
WTS. Do not flavor.



Code          WTS Additive
160009       None
160010       6% Ammonium Chloride
160011       6% Diammonium Phosphate
160012       6% Ammonium Sulfate
160013       6% Magnesium Chloride
160014       6% Urea-Phosphate
160015       6% Sodium Borate
160016       6% Calcium Formate
160017       6% Diammonium Phosphate
160018       6% Ammonium Sulfate
160019       6% Magnesium Chloride

We will provide the additive solutions but would like to be notified
1 day in advance of sample preparation. We would also like to know
to advance the WTS moisture content (preferably 4-10%). After the
initial drying, please allow the castings to air dry (rather than
drying) to adjust the WTS moistures to 14%. This should assure better
penetration of the additives into the WTS samples.

FINAL REPORT
SWEDES 121 DISTRIBUTION CHECK
PROJECT #1975-224

BACKGROUND

A store check has been conducted for SWEDES 121 to determine the extent to which this brand is in distribution. Distribution is measured in terms of product availability to the consumer at the time of the store check. Out-of-stock is reported as unavail- ability.

Stores were checked in person by a local ASI representative, who checked for availability of both styles of SWEDES, either visually or by attempting to purchase a pack. Visual inspection was made at stores having self-service displays; in the remaining stores, purchase of one pack of each style was attempted.

If a store did not have the brand available, the interviewer at- tempted to determine whether or not the brand was ever carried by that store.

Store checks were conducted on November 5th and 6th, 1975. A total of 300 stores were checked: 200 in the major metro area of Atlanta and 50 each in Athens/Madison. The brand was introduced to the retail trade in early September 1975.

Retail outlets included in the check were selected proportionately from the different types of outlets in each market as reported by the Sales Department in the “1975 Call Card Analysis”. Vending machines and military installations were excluded.

MEMORANDUM

July 29, 1983

TO: R. D. Sharp

CC: M. J. Novak

FROM: S. E. Gustafson

SUBJECT: BATTLE KIT SUPPORT HISTORY

PURPOSE:

Response to your request for past levels of support
for Battle Kit.

DISCUSSION:

BATTLE KIT BUDGET HISTORY

1980   1981  1982  1983  PROPOSED
1.75MM 1.5MM 1.274MM 1.6MM 1.35MM

BATTLE KIT ITEM HISTORY

1980   1981  1982  1983  1984
2.299MM 3.755MM 2.992MM 2.625MM 2.213MM*

*Based on proposed budget and .61 average cost per
item in 1983.

Because there are so many contradictory records on
past Battle Kit items, it is impossible to determine
the actual figures for 1980 and 1981. The budget
figures represent the amount spent on Battle Kit in a
given year. The item amounts represent what was
available for use in a given year, some of which were
carried over from previous years and SMP programs.

Let me know if you need additional information.

MEMO #2

FROM: T. M. Wade, Jr., JRBA

REDAC TED

In reference to Mr. Davis’s letter of December 30, I suspect his theory
is based on the idea that there will be an air passage through the
center of the cigarette; however, this is not my interpretation. I sus-
pect this is more theory than practice, however, since tobacco
swirls on heating and tends to close up again.

In addition to this, a cigarette produced, being drained for the
packing within it, would tend to become more
uniform.

It is possible, as he says, that the packing within a cigarette could
be controlled by air pressure; however, I do not believe we should
attempt to do this in mass since each single cigarette would have
to be tested individually. The amount of equipment
would be tremendous.

REF Formula Modification for RC-TM

Reference is made to my memorandum and enclosed formula dated August
12 concerning the modification to RC-TM reconstituted tobacco. The
formula as enclosed is incomplete in wording under the heading
"Miscellaneous Tobacco Usage". With the addition of Burley stems
as input tobacco for RC-TM, this section in the formula should
read as follows:

“Miscellaneous tobaccos, when available, to be used up
to a maximum of 8% of the input formula reducing all
other components proportionately except Flue-Cured stems
and Burley stems which will remain constant at 40% and
10% respectively.”



We will ask Hammer Division, by way of this memorandum, to make this
correction in their formula prior to submission to the appropriate
offices.

LORILLARD SALES TRENDS

Maverick Specials - Sales Continue to increase throughout the area. Most significant sales gains have been made in cigarette outlets, tax differential outlets and convenience stores. The continuous buy down is the driving force behind volume gains. The recent change to $0.50 per carton buy down gives us a greater advantage over the competition thus further increasing sales. However, with the increased buy down value, many accounts are now being identified as having RIR’s EDLP Program. This may have a negative impact on limiting our promotional support at retail for Maverick brands. The two Box 100's packings are experiencing sales growth as distribution and awareness are now at higher levels. Maverick is now firmly established as the #2 or #3 overall brand in the inner city Atlanta. Menthol Box 100 is now a power brand in urban Atlanta.

Newport - All box packings continue to enjoy substantial overall growth. The Lights Box packings continue to experience distribution and awareness increases. Much of the Light Box growth is coming from outside the Newport family. Newport is maintaining its market position despite competitive programs and the recent impact of the price increase.

Newport 120’s - Distribution objectives are being met. Brand is beginning to show slow, but steady gains overall since the change in target trade of class to General Market stores. Sales continue to be soppy. Couponed product tends to sell through, however non-couponed product sales are usually slow. Actual sales continue to favor Full Flavor 120’s over Light 120's.

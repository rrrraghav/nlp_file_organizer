TOTAL INDUSTRY

Total industry unit shipment volume for the week ending Friday, January 30 was 6.695B units.

This volume is -1.448B units or -.178% versus the same week, year ago.

The modest weekly shipment volume, 6.695B units versus 8.143B units for the same week year ago, continues to
be influenced by sharp cutbacks in purchasing by McIane Distributing.

Note that price increases were announced by major manufacturers on Friday, January 23 on shipments effective
Tuesday, January 26. Timing of the announcements provided almost no opportunity for the major manufacturers
to “load” product at the current (“old”) price.

Terms for the week’s price increases generally included a credit memo for the difference between the old and new prices
for two week’s average purchases.



Niggett was the lone exception offering customers the opportunity (read requirement) to purchase two weeks
average unit volume prior to the end of January to participate in their price increase terms. Consequently their
share of market for the week rose significantly (Table 6).

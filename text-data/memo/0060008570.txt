PW Domestic Blend Line Consolidation

Executive approval has been granted to consolidate the domestic flue-cured
and burley filter and nonfilter blend lines. In early April, filter (BFB)
and nonfilter (NFB) flue-cured lines were consolidated into one line
designated BDL. On May 15, filter (KMFB) and nonfilter (KMLS) burley lines
were consolidated into one line designated KDL.

Attached are new formulas for the preparation of tobacco blends for the
following cigarette brands affected by the Blend Line consolidation:

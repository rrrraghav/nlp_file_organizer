Re: Newport Lights Direct Mail Test

Roland, in working with our Direct Marketing data base, I’ve identified sufficient Salem smokers in the state of Michigan to make a Direct Mail test for Newport Lights worthwhile.

In brief, you might want to consider a test with 5,000+ Salem Family smokers. DMG would develop a Direct Mail piece for Newport Lights. The objective would be to stimulate conversion to the brand by educating these consumers about Newport Lights white tip and offering money-saving coupons.

Please advise.

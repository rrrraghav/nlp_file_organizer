We are interested in potential retail outlets where we can arrange a field research company to intercept purchasers of "Premier" to set up a panel of these smokers.

Could you please advise, as soon as possible, a list of the largest cooperative cigarette retailers in the Phoenix, St. Louis, and Tucson areas that will allow such a research program.

In selecting likely outlets, please be guided as follows:

- Large (500+ Volume) outlets are preferred.
- A "Premier" Display should be on location.
- Up to $50 will be paid, when necessary, by the research company to buy cooperation.
- This is an in-store consumer intercept program; no field Sales Organization time will be expended.

Please advise your proposed retail candidates (via return fax) as soon as possible.

Thank you.

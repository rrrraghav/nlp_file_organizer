PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK 10017

TO: Field Sales Force DATE: April 13, 1995
FROM: Craig Johnson/Senior VP, Sales
SUBJECT: Ask First / It’s the Law (5/30 - 7/28)

Selling cigarettes to minors is against the law. While PM USA does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers, PM USA has always advocated that retail accounts comply with the law.

One of the ways to further support the Company's commitment regarding restricting the sale of cigarettes is to reinforce this principle with our accounts and their employees. Importantly, retailers nationwide have been asking us for assistance in complying with their state laws.

As a result, we are providing you with enhanced program materials to use with your accounts. These program materials were successfully tested in Cincinnati in the fourth quarter of 1994. Our focus with accounts begins in June and July, with continuous program support in the balance of 1995. Program details are outlined below.

Current Situation
The law holds retailers responsible for selling tobacco products legally. Retailers that sell cigarettes to minors may be subject to fines, a loss of license and possibly even jail time.

Key Issue
How do we help to inform and educate retailers and their employees regarding their responsibilities to enforce their state laws?

The Plan
In June and July, place the “Ask First/It’s the Law” program in all workload accounts during normal call coverage. Then continue to place materials during 1995, making this part of your in-store mission.

Here's How It Works
• Selling Guidelines
 - Sell the program to all accounts as a value-added service, beginning May 30, 1995
 - Thoroughly review the program materials to ensure that retailers understand their responsibilities.
 - A copy of the Ask First/It’s the Law Sell-In Story is enclosed and can be accessed via the SI Support-File Server in the folder entitled “Ask First/It’s the Law Sell-In Story.”

DEC 7 1976 PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.
INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

W.F. GANNON

To: Dr. W. F. Gannon Date: December 6, 1976
From: R. B. Seligman
Subject: 5 Mg Products

On December 17, 1976, the following people
from New York will visit the Research Center to
discuss 5 mg products:

Bob Fitzmaurice . . . . . Dick Gumz
Bill Engelbrecht . . . . . Skip Long
Al Bismeyer (perhaps).

I would appreciate your leading these
discussions. They are particularly interested in
5 mg Parliament and a 5 mg free-standing brand. Please
have minutes of the discussion prepared for distribution
to Mr. W. McDowell and Mr. F. Resnik.

It might be a good time to expose these
marketing types to the high-speed photographs of smoke
issuing from various filters, particularly Parliament.

If you have any questions, please let me
know.

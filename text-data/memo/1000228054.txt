Analysis

The “Guidelines for Smoking Control” is a 134 page document which describes a variety of programs for controlling smoking. The manual was written by Messrs. Nigel Gray and Michael Daube under the auspices of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC).

The UICC is an international organization whose general mandate is to "achieve the eventual prevention and cure of cancer”. Its membership consists of 188 organizations representing 77 countries. It has an operating budget of approximately U.S. $2,000,000.

Through its alliance with the World Health Organization, The International Agency for Research on Cancer and other groups, the UICC is involved in developing smoking control strategies and programs worldwide. It is responsible also for publication of a number of journals and working papers covering a broad spectrum of cancer related issues.

The UICC has organized a number of symposia on smoking and health. In October 1980, three smoking control symposia were conducted in South America with the participation of national cancer societies and other UICC affiliated organizations. The “Guidelines for Smoking Control” was prepared as a result of an earlier symposium held in Paris during April 1980.

The Guidelines has ten chapters and four appendices. Chapters through five set forth the nationals involved smoking control programs. Included in these sections are the UICC’s policy objectives, an outline of the scientific evidence supporting the anti-smoking movement's allegations and the broad strategies to be applied toward the control of smoking worldwide.

SUBJECT BROWN & WILLIAMSON - Filter Tips
REFER TO J. Moser to F. Shaw - 2/14/74

CONFIDENTIAL

Joy, your referenced letter quite a number of requirements for this component of the filter tip that Brown has asked you to supply, but it is still
rather vague as to what they want. I have included several suggestions herewith, hoping that at least some are acceptable to each of these, I assure
them more closely to hit the target in the center.

One of the points of confusion is that the first requirement you indicate
that the material should have a yield (first to 250 sig., 14 lb. ft. c. 22.5/ft
to 300 ft.) and then be able to produce a filter tip with a draw satisfactory except for the fact that the bleached kraft absorbs oil and water.
I am not sure what they mean by this, but I will check it out.

One of the immediately available samples which we are including herewith
is B-29 1045/1 which is 40% white opaque gummite to 13.25 ply. That also
has a yield of approximately 260 ft. per pound, and as you will note,
moreover, we should point out that ground #1 will do wick, but it will
not be quite so good in the draw. It is not quite as smooth, but I
way except_yield, something quite similar could be produced from 254/R
white opaque gummite to 13.25 ply (cold).

A second candidate attached is EXP-0-39-18 which consists of 50 gauge polyester
a white knit yarn - 230 PS. This would conduct it into a little thicker in gauge
than they want, but I think that we could produce something like this by
type of structure employing a polyester face for the stiffness and a poly
ethylene back to give the desired draw. The cost on this type of material
is approximately 2 cents, or if went to 1 mill a little higher.

I have also included a sample of EXP-0-39-17 which is a similar construction
except that it uses a 45 gauge polyester yarn and a poly ethylene back. This
would give a draw more like what they want, but the stiffness would be less.
The cost on this type of material would be approximately 1.8 cents.

I am also including herewith a sample of 254/R white opaque gummite to 13.25 ply
(cold) which is similar to B-29 1045/1, but it has a slightly better draw.
The cost on this type of material would be approximately 1.6 cents.

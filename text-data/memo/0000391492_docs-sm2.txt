SUBJECT: SCREEN SIZES FOR SMALL STACK FORMAT

DATE: JULY 16, 1977

Thank you in sending your current design specifications for
removal of small stack as a screening device.

We concur and would recommend starting with a 6 inch size screen.
Our operating experience is gained in using thin metal strip material,
so we suggest the initial size be a standard one. This should be
allowed for in our budget.

The table below gives the screen specifications for the 6 inch size as
well as for some of the potential future sizes. All are based on
a 0.012 inch thick wire cloth specification. Stainless steel screen
surfaces should be used to all cases.

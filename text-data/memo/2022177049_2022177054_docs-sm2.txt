Subject: BERMUDA HUNDRED PILOT PLANT (PROJECT ART)

Results Week of May 30, 1988:

Three runs were completed in the four work days this week. One day was taken for scheduled maintenance of the pilot plant. The highlights were as per below:

a DL blend tobacco was extracted to 98% nicotine reduction at standard conditions (200 M/M, 140°F), 2.6% AN and CRS absorber @ 11% K-citrate, 25% OV. Nicotine profile indicated loading on 50% of the absorber bed and no breakthrough. Run 88-153.

NOTE: CO₂ circulation was stopped under 1500 psi pressure during the recovery step. The wax layer on filler was not eliminated.

b In a low AB level test, DL blend was extracted to 96% nicotine reduction at 200 M/M, 140°F, 1.9% AN, with CRS absorber at 11% K-citrate and 35% OV. Nicotine profile indicated no breakthrough with 50% of the CRS absorber showing no loading. Run 88-154.

c In a special test, Marlboro filler (without DIEE, with ESB) was extracted to 96% nicotine reduction at 200 M/M, 140°F, 2.0% target AB level. The CRS absorber at 11% K-citrate showed no nicotine breakthrough and no nicotine loading on only 5/8th of the bed. Run 88-155.

Maintenance:

The carbon-de-activation oven was tested in a dry run without carbon, for operability. All the electrical/control systems worked well. Other maintenance activity included:

a Installation of new variable speed control on nicotine monitor sampling pump.

b Replacement of seal ring on Mogas valve V-50, to eliminate a persistent leak.

c Routine check of all valve clamps for designated torque.

Personnel:

Charles Crawley of Quality Assurance will be leaving the pilot plant operation to rejoin his QA assignment, effective September 1, 1988.

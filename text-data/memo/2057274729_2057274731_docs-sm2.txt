Subject: Examination of Centrifuged Boehmite

Two samples of Boehmite, precipitated sol-gel, batch 001, were received. One of the samples, labelled product, had been centrifuged, dried and ground. The other sample was the feed sol-gel prior to centrifugation.

Both samples were mounted on carbon stubs with carbon paint and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backscatter electron microscopy.

The purpose of this examination was to determine if any metal flakes from the stainless steel centrifuge vessel were present within the product. Backscatter SEM was used to locate these since it affords the ability to selectively view differences in atomic number elements within a sample. This is demonstrated by Figure 1 where a small piece of a stainless steel razor blade was examined to serve as a control.

The feed sol-gel sample examined showed no metal (Figures 2–3). Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was then used on the product to determine if there was a high concentration of metals present. Al, the constituent of the sol-gel, was the only element detected (Figure 4).

The product was then subjected to backscatter SEM. No metal flakes were noted within the sample examined (Figures 5–8).

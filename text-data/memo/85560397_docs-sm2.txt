We have scheduled time on May 9th and 10th to present

Newport. The objective of these sessions is to provide
direction for corporate media and promotion planning as
well as to find ways for our brands to capitalize on
emerging market trends.

These meetings are an outgrowth of the long range
presentation made at the October Marketing Management
Conference. The Senior Brand Managers have been
directed to translate their Agency’s Long Range Plans
into actionable 3 Year Marketing Plans. They have also
been asked to expand on areas of particular interest.

The work schedule for these meetings is as follows:

Wednesday, 5/9
A.M. - Kent
P.M. - Newport

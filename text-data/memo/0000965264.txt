SUBJECT: WORK AREAS AND PRIORITIES FOR MAJOR MANUFACTURING MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS/136

Listed below are descriptions of the work areas in order of priority for Manufacturing Measurement Systems (MMS) based on input from Bacon Quality Assurance (QA).

1. Final Flavor Verification - A benchtop method, similar in function but not necessarily the same technology to the Casing Verification System, that provides a rapid pass/fail output on final flavors sent from the Flavor Prep area.

2. Quantitative Analysis of Casings - A timely method that takes Casing Verification a step further: Reliable quantitative analysis of casing components.

3. Detection of Menthol Shorts - An on-line system for the non-menthol reclaim line to detect the presence of menthol shorts.

As always, these work areas and priorities will be reviewed periodically to assure MMS is addressing QA’s needs.

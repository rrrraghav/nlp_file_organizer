INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia Date: June 15, 1992

To: Distribution
From: Kurt Junker

Subject: Strategy Teams Presentations and Next Steps

I would like to thank each of the strategy team leaders for the effort devoted by themselves and their strategy teams in preparing for our presentations this week. It was very clear that a significant level of detailed work and research, and most importantly teamwork, went into each of the teams’ presentations, with the result being an excellent starting point for Operations as we develop our Five Year Plan.

In addition to the feedback each team received during their presentations, discussions following the conclusion of the final presenter allowed for the opportunity to review the strategic issues collectively. Shown below are the next steps and timing issues relative to each team.

Product Development (Jim Myrick)

- Form a product integration team (Blending, Flavor Development, Materials Purchasing, Packaging, Product Development-R&D, QA Engineering, Technical Services) and identify its leader.
- The task of this integration team is to prioritize the product related proposals for 1992, 1993 and beyond, develop an implementation schedule and to commence managing its execution.
- Implementation recommendations regarding the development process will be incorporated into our five year plan with further definition to be provided by the Restructuring.

Resolution of the program prioritization needs by June 30 in order that each group may proceed with the development of their respective plans.

Quality (Don Knudson)

The following items were identified for follow-up:
- The definition of a factory measurement system is needed as a basis for goal setting in the factories. (Recommendation to GM by June 30).
- Quality issues in the Processing Plant and in Primaries need to be addressed when determining the factory measurement system.
- Development of the Competitive Quality Index is a key need for our Quality focus as we learn what to measure against. This will probably be more relevant than consumer complaints. (To be developed and in place by Sept. 30).
- A proposal and recommendation of the role of Quality beyond Operations is needed to clarify who is responsible for quality throughout the chain. (To be available by July 31).
- A complete identification of program recommendations and priorities relative to Quality is needed. (By June 30).

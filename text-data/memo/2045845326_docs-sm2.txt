INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

TO: G. Garner DATE: September 28, 1990
FROM: B. A. Reuter
SUBJECT: Computer Software and Hardware Support
to Upgrade PM-USA Forecasting

As Bill Moore’s request, we held a meeting on September 20 to discuss how current PM-USA volume forecasts are made and the computer systems used to support them. As a result of that session, the three forecasting groups -

Department Contact
Sales Planning Pat Piscielli
Market Research Ed Gawronski
Production Planning Dan Blysma

have submitted “wish lists” of what they would like to have to upgrade their work.

I appreciate your willingness to meet with the authors of the attached lists early in October and determine what is practical to develop and implement by January 1, 1991. The sense of urgency is due to the fact that the current approach is having a negative effect on the quality of our production planning at a time when capacity is severely constrained.

Thank you for your assistance.

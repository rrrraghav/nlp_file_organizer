RE: Records Disposal Notice

In connection with certain ongoing legal activity, the records (some or all of which already may be under disposal suspension in connection with previous requests) listed in Attachment A to this notice (the “records”) are hereby placed under disposal suspension.

The notice applies to all forms of records, including paper records, computer-based electronic records (including computer disks and tapes), microfilm, video and audio recordings, and every other memorialization of information and other material related to the specified subjects.

If the specified records exist in paper form, you must keep them, without alteration, organized in the way that you would normally keep them for business purposes (for example, if you usually file them in folders, continue to do so). If they are no longer needed for normal business purposes, however, they may be boxed and placed in storage (properly identified and labeled as disposal-suspended material). Electronic records that are the subjects of previously issued disposal suspension notices dated April 6, 1994, April 21, 1994, May 4, 1994 and July 28, 1994 and those that are incapable of being printed must be preserved in electronic form. All other electronic records (including e-mail) should be printed and retained only in paper form.

Records already subject to disposal suspension are listed in the applicable Records Management Manual and in prior records disposal suspension notices, which remain in effect with change.

Be advised that failure to comply with this notice could subject the individual or the Company to civil and/or criminal penalties.

Thank you for your cooperation. If you have any questions regarding this notice, please call me in New York (ext. 4019).

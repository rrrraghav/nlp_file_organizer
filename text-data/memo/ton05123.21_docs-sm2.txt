MEMORANDUM

TO: Nancy A. Hughes

FROM: Alexander H. King aking

SUBJECT: Northwest College of Tobacco Knowledge

Although we’re not yet certain as to which of the TAN volunteers
names that we submitted to Washington, D.C., will be approved
for invitation to our College of Tobacco Knowledge, I did discuss
location with Mr. Kerrigan on Friday.

Let's now "lock in" some facilities and space for a College of
Tobacco Knowledge in Portland, Oregon. Even if the large number
of potential invitees from Oregon company locations are not
approved; let’s home in and use Portland as a central location
to have the event.

Let’s discuss.

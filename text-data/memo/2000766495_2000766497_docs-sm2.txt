I. LOW TAR FILLER (LTF)

A. Chemical Evaluation

1. The LTF-IIIF formulation whose whole smoke condener-
sate compared favorably to that of IIIA has been modified further
at the request of the Chemical Research Group (6908). One of
these modifications was that of IIJF which is a similar material
to IIDF but without humectant.

The whole smoke condensate of IIJF was then compared
to that of IIDF and based on the correlation of Grimmier
fractions II, III and IV with activity, the order of relative
predicted activity is LTF-IIIF > LTF-IIDF. The absolute activity,
however, is predicted to be low for both types since the yield
of fraction II is greater than 90% in both cases.

2. It was decided to test LTF-IIJF further and the
production of 15,000 pounds of this material is scheduled to
begin at the BL Pilot Plant on September 22.

B. Smoking Evaluations

1. A range of low tar fillers (LTF-IIDF, IIEF, IIIF
and IIIC*) possessing similar subjective characteristics, varying
tar deliveries and significantly lower CO values (7-9 mg/cigt)
were developed and screened.

2. The blend and flavor development studies were
continued with 50 and 75% LTF-IIDF in the blend.

3. The use of a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts
of the low molecular weight organic acids (C1-C4) with LTF-IIIF
formulation produced an acceptable mainstream/sidestream smoke
at the 50 and 75% levels.

4. The role of sheet foaming on tar and CO deliveries
is now being investigated with foamed/unfoamed IIF-IID and IIII.

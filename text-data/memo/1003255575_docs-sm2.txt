INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Mr. F. L. Daylor Date: February 24, 1984
From: H. Maxwell
Subject: Lower Tar and CO

Personnel: H. Maxwell - R.P.

OBJECTIVES:

Generally, to develop lower tar and CO versions of present brands.
Specifically to develop a reduced CO MUL by use of the COD filter.

STATUS:

A baseline POL (V-4835) is complete, testing MUL versus a reduced CO version utilizing a high efficiency filter with low RTD(~) . The control was overwhelmingly preferred.

A second test (POL-4309) utilizing the COD filter (RTD~=3 and 75% dilution) was rejected because of tar and nicotine analytical values of the experimental cigarette. Microscopic examination of the COD filters of these cigarettes indicate leaking and condensation of TPM along the supposedly sealed plastic filter insert. This occurs in a large number of the COD filters but not all. Evaluations of hand made cigarettes utilizing a new shipment of COD filters to determine if this condition continues to exist is in progress. A remake of this test is scheduled for this week.

PLANS:

Evaluate POL-4309 Remake March, 1984
Evaluate severity of COD filter
Insert leakage problem March, 1984
Effect subjective improvements if necessary May, 1984

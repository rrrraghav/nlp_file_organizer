(PROJECT B 279)

A control and a set of cigarettes with three levels of sodium nitrite were smoked and analyzed for nitric oxide. The samples and control were Kent III Ultra Light 100”/s.

The sample cigarettes were treated with 25, 50, and 100 µl solutions containing 50% NaNO₃. As shown in the data below nitric oxides deliveries are strongly dependent on the added nitrite.

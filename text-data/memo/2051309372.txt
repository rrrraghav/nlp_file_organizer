PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017-5592

TO: William Lynch III DATE: February 7, 1994

FROM: Charles R. Wall

SUBJECT: Document Retention

Because of litigation involving Phillip Morris Industrial, Milprint Inc. and
Polymer Industries, I would appreciate it if you would suspend the destruction of
all documents relating to those entities until further notice from me.

These entities are now doing business as Colonial Heights Packaging Inc., and
documents regarding that corporation should also be kept until further notice.

Thank you.

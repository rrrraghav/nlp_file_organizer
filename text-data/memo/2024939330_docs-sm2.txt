I am delighted to report that Dr. Bern Dryer of Medex
International has agreed to work with us. He and his
group have done a considerable amount of thinking fol-
lowing our first meeting with them. They have reviewed
the smoker/non-smoker literature (White, Proeb, Hirayama,
Trichopoulos, et al), and are eager to start on some
short and long range programming.

Our next meeting is on Friday, May 8th, in the Byron,
Connecticut office of Medex. At that time, they will
have a working contract and plan, and we will discuss
next steps.

If any of you would like to join us--I would, of course,
welcome it.

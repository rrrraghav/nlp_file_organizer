Earlier this week, we discovered that an ingredient supplied by Celanese which is used in the manufacture of filter material was contaminated with a bacteria. The manufactured product containing this material gave off an unpleasant odor, which is how we detected the problem initially. We immediately ceased production, cleaned out the tanks and pipes containing the material, and did not resume production until a substitute material was obtained from another vendor. We also put a hold on all of the affected product that was within our control.

Ongoing testing revealed that the presence of the bacteria triggered a chain reaction which led to the formation of a byproduct by the name of methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), a toxic substance. MITC can cause various forms of discomfort, including eye, nose and throat irritation, dizziness, coughing, and wheezing, if inhaled in sufficient quantities.

We have no evidence that any of the affected product reached the retail distribution channel. However, it is possible that some of it did, and we cannot easily or quickly verify that fact. Accordingly, because we are dealing with a toxic substance, we decided out of an abundance of caution to institute a nationwide consumer recall. As a result, we are recalling in the U.S. domestic market every pack of cigarettes, both at retail and wholesale, of all of the brands shown on the attached list. That recall was launched at 3:00 p.m., which is within one day of becoming aware of the scope of the problem. A copy of the press release announcing the recall is attached. We will also be running newspaper ads starting tomorrow.

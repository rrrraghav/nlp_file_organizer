Exhibit B

Memorandum

To: R. O. Stewart

Cc: S. Storer

From: W. L. McCafferty

Date: July 8, 1977

Subject: VICEROY Lights Packaging Objectives
and Strategies

Purpose

In accordance with the 1978 marketing plan for VICEROY/VICEROY
Lights, this memorandum outlines our thinking on a revision
of VICEROY Lights packaging, graphics, and special
promotional considerations.

As soon as we have your concurrence, we will meet with John DiGiammo
and his design development team.

Packaging Objectives

Convince the consumer, through high quality packaging graphics,
that VICEROY Lights is a good-tasting, lower “tar” product.

Project high quality, yet not be pretentious; communicate
a brand image of sophisticated enjoyment and contemporary
awareness.

Develop an "image" package that is a look design that does not
resemble any other cigarette brands.

Present a favorable shelf impact on the consumer as a unique
and individual manner.

Capture the essential benefits of VICEROY parent brand styles
in terms of material identification characteristics

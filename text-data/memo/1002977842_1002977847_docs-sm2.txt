INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: J. L. Charles Date: July 26, 1982
From: J. S. Long
Subject: Plans and Objectives for 1983 (Charge Number 1101)

The objectives of Entomological Research are:

A. To reduce insect damage to stored and processed tobaccos.

B. To maintain an awareness of new processes and technology in relation to their impact on beetle control.

C. To provide consulting, technical, and QA services on request to PM USA and PMI.

The subobjectives which we plan to use to accomplish objective A are as follows:

I. CIGARETTE BEETLE PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES

A. Cigarette Beetle Growth and Development

Principal Investigator – Ms. Marie Minor (Associate Scientist B)

1. Determine cigarette beetle growth and development rates on grades of burley, bright, oriental, RV, DIET, BL, RL, and RCB tobaccos. Criteria used to evaluate growth and development will be generation time, larval weight, percentage of adult emergence, fertility, and fecundity of adults. This data will enable us to respond to requests regarding potential for beetle infestation in these tobaccos. New blend concepts (short/medium term) and new tobacco processing technology.

2. Evaluate the effect of mold on growth and development. This would be a basic study of the biology of the cigarette beetle. Recent reports in the literature indicate mold may have a positive effect on stored-product insect growth and development. Molds occurring on tobacco will be identified, cultured, and inoculations of tobacco cultures will be initiated. The same criteria as those described in No. 1 shall be used. Natural tobacco flavors (medium term).

B. Larval Symbiont

Principal Investigator – Mr. Robert Lehman

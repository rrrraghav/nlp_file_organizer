Re: Model Vending/Youth Bill

Enclosed is the revised model bill that was agreed to during last Wednesday’s
conference call. The model will be adapted and used in response to state and local
legislation that is anticipated as a result of the model state vending legislation that has
been proposed to the states by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan. The side-by-side analysis
of the industry and Sullivan model bills has been revised and also is enclosed.

Further use of the industry model for proactive or preemptive initiatives will
be considered on a case by case basis until the negotiations on the Kennedy and
Waxman bills have been finalized.

SUBJECT Phoenix Field Trip Report - Spanish Market

On 3/3 and 3/4, representatives of the Brand Group, Ted Bates, and the B&W Sales Force called on Spanish retail outlets in the Phoenix metro area. The objectives of this trip were as follows:

* Evaluate KOOL’s performance (all styles) at predominantly Hispanic retail outlets.

* Evaluate Hispanic market performance of all brands and segments in regard to determine growth opportunities.

* Evaluate in-store presence of all brands and in-store promotional activity.

Key Observations

The Hispanic market in Phoenix is clearly a full-taste non-menthol market. Marlboro and Winston are far and away the leading brands. At best, menthol usage among Hispanic smokers is about equal to the national average (30%). In no way does menthol usage in the Hispanic community resemble that of the Black community. There does not appear to be any stigma associated with menthol cigarettes however.

KOOL and Salem full-taste styles are neck and neck in the Phoenix Hispanic market but neither is considered by store managers to be a fast mover in comparison to Marlboro and Winston.

Low tar* brands, menthol and non-menthol, have exhibited only marginal growth among Hispanics according to the trade. Roughly 10-20% of brands stocked in stores in the heart of the Hispanic community were bl-ts.

Very little promotional activity was observed at retail in the Hispanic market. A few American “pack-on-end” displays were observed as well as some blister pack lighter offers for decade. The receptivity of the trade to cr-pack promotional items varied. Cigarette coupon redemption was reported to be low to non-existent.

RE: Additional Benzo[a]pyrene Analysis on Acetonitrile Fractions

These fractions were examined in the same manner as the previously reported ones.

Fraction 61 showed no band at the benzo[a]pyrene R,.

Fraction 73 was analyzed for benzo[a]pyrene, and we found
1715 µg. in the 4.35 ml. sample remaining from the original 5 ml. of tar sample. This would mean a total of 1971 µg. in this fraction, of which 256 µg. was submitted for painting.

Fraction 75 contained a total of 838 µg. in the original 5 ml.
sample, and 109 µg. was submitted for painting. The original sample weight was 62.2 mg.

The following table gives a synopsis of fractions examined thus
far.

[Submitted]
Fraction Orig. Wt./5 ml. µg B[a]P/0.65ml Remaining Total B[a]P
72 74.4 µg. 229 1530 1759
73 62.2 µg. .256 1715 1971
74 59.5 µg. 136 912 1048
75 57.9 µg. .109 729 .838
Total  5616

Fractions 61 and 71 had no benzo[a]pyrene; Fraction 76 may have had a trace.

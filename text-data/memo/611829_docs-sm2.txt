MEMORANDUM

TO: ART EDELSTEIN SUBJECT: Chicago Scrapbook
FROM: Tom Neville DATE: June 15, 1979

Superb! Fantastic! Great! Right on! The Best! Perfect! Tremendous!

Need I say more? Of course, the PKG prepared scrapbook was well done and more importantly, it served the purpose for which it was meant.
Say thanks to those who obviously carried out a "labor of love."

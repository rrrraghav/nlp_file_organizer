PHILLIP MORRIS, U.S.A. INTEROPFICE CORRESPONDENCE
120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017

TO: Distribution DATE: May 26, 1987
FROM: Ralph Atlas

SUBJECT: CAPRI - LOS ANGELES

We have been advised that a Los Angeles, CA distributor has
just received a quantity of CAPRI sell-in samples for
presentation to the trade this week or next.

As you know, we circulated information about the brands'
expansion into Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama and AD
AGE last week listed those states as the expansion markets. The
Los Angeles move today was surprising.

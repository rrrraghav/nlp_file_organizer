BACKGROUND

In evaluating marketing initiatives to maintain the Newport consumer base, a Franchise Continuity Test Program has been developed. The test program will be implemented in the Boston and Milwaukee markets, with a starting date of April 29,1996.

The strategies set forth for this program are as follows:

1. Develop a program to reward continuity of purchase among Newport’s current users.

2. Offer premium items that reflect Newport's quality product image.

3. Create a look and feel consistent with Newport’s brand imagery.

4. Deliver a small catalog on packs and on cartons to target Newport smokers only.

5. Feature an 800# in the small catalog through which consumers may request a larger catalog (containing a greater selection of items) via mail.

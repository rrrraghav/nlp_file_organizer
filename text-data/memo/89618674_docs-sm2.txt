ACUTE TOXICITY/IMMUNOMODULATORY TESTING

R. House at IIRI finished all scheduled follow-up immune function studies for B100. While there was some question as to the suitability of the positive assay controls used, results suggest some effect of B100 on natural killer cell activity or T-cell blastogenesis (with anti-CD3). The extended dose Listeria host resistance assay using BCG301 mice instead of C61) was not valid due to a lack of the required 5-35% mortality in the control group. It is undecided at this time whether to repeat this assay using Listeria or use another bacterial host resistance model. However, T-cell function as assessed by induction of delayed type hypersensitivity was affected by dosing with B100. This may indicate that in vivo testing during the dosing period or in vitro methods using tissue harvested during the dosing period or shortly thereafter (before extensive cell replication) may better reveal immunomodulatory effects. It may also be worth it to look at stress-related endpoints (ACTH, glucocorticoids, etc).

Immunomodulatory testing of B35 was initiated, as well as range finder testing for B240 and B249.

Prices were received for both acute toxicity and immunomodulatory testing of compounds in 1995.

CELLULOSE ACETATE (CA) FIBER PROJECT

Due to the intense effort required of the local arrangements committee for the upcoming TCRC, no work was done on this project this month. Results on chemical analyses are still pending from F. Berini, who was also busy preparing a TCRC presentation.

TCRC COMMITTEE

Attended planning committee meetings and participated in various organized activities such as other subcommittees. Verified all arrangements for the guest hospitality program. Manne the guest and on-site registration desk during the conference supervised breakfasts and tours for the registered guests.

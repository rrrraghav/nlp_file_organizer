INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Lee Pollak Date: November 19, 1987
From: John Vaughan,

Subject: SAFETY - PHILIPPINES

We have received an inquiry, copy attached, from Philip Morris
Asia Region concerning the transmittal of safety information to the
La Suerte Licensee. The information to be furnished is the Material
Safety Data Sheet for flammable and combustible materials which relate
specifically to the casings and flavors supplied to La Suerte by
Philip Morris. A copy of the data sheets, as furnished by PM USA, is
also attached.

The Material Safety Data Sheets do not fully cover the safety
aspect of the materials being handled and I suggest that La Suerte
also be provided PM USA’s procedure “Safe Storage, Handling, Mixing,
and Application of Ethyl Alcohol Based Flavorings”, a copy of which is
attached. If we are reluctant to issue a PM USA document to La
Suerte, perhaps the PM USA reference could be removed and the document
provided as good safety practices.

I would appreciate your review of the attached information and
your advice.

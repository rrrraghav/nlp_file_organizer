Picture Good on live coverage. Poor for replay (color bleeds).
Varied for commercials, but better than replay of races. Black & white
and color often different feed. Tearing in many cases.

Audio No sound on sets in areas other than lounges and bar/dining
areas. (These areas account for less than 50% of the sets.)

Commercial Placement
Extremely poor. The spots are run, as noted, under format,
after the race has been finalized in all respects and all fans are once
again buried in the Morning Telegraph or something.

Commercial Breakdown
12:45 Chevron Between Musak –
12:46 Rheingold Over an hour before
12:55 White Label post time for first race.

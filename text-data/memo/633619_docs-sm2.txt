MEMORANDUM

TO: G. T. Reid
CC: F. E. McKennon
     J. L. Collins, Jr.
     F. Canary
DATE: February 20, 1979
FROM: R. C. Hudson
SUBJECT: Bus Shelter Signage

The purpose of this memo is to review the Bus Shelter Signage presentation given here on 2/15/79.

Background

Larry Silberman and Henry Davis of Inter City Communications Network, presented us with an out-of-home media concept which has the potential to drastically improve our advertising presence in the Northeast and other geographically targeted areas.

They have recently acquired the contract rights for Bus Shelter Signage in New York (Manhattan), Brooklyn, and Queens for a three year period for this year. Although Newport has historically had a monopoly position on this medium during the past few years, the gentlemen expressed an interest in obtaining additional commitments from other preferred rights. However, it is not their intention to grant any one cigarette company exclusive rights to this medium.

The following highlights the key points discussed in the meeting:

Locations

* The company has bus shelter positions in New York (Manhattan) which will be available in June, 1979.

* Also, they have the rights to the Bronx borough with units currently under construction.

FROM T. F. Neville DATE March 26, 1982
SUBJECT KOOL JAZZ FESTIVAL - NEW YORK

PURPOSE

To summarize the KJF - New York agreement between Brown & Williamson and Festival Production, Inc. (George Wein).

BACKGROUND

In late 1980, the company made the decision to expand KOOL’s music sponsorship program. The cornerstone of the expanded program was the 25 year old Newport Jazz Festival (Newport, Rhode Island). In order to fully capitalize on the popularity associated with this well known festival, it was felt that the event must be held in New York. Because FPI owned the rights to Newport, a five year agreement was negotiated which in effect gave BWT the right to move Newport Jazz Festival to New York and call it the KOOL JAZZ Festival.

Financial/Business Details of the Agreement

1981 $200,000 - $200,000 1-1-81; $ 50,000 7-1-81
1982 250,000 - " 1-1-82;  7-1-82
1983 300,000 - " 1-1-83; 100,000 7-1-83
1984 300,000 - " 1-1-84;  " 7-1-84
1985 300,000 - " 1-1-85;  " 7-1-85

Cancellation Rights

If we decide to cancel the New York Festival, we are obligated to pay 60% of all remaining fees. The cancellation date for each upcoming year is Sept. 1. If we don't notify FPI by then, BWT is committed to that year’s entire fee.

RE: Media coverage of G.I.A.S. poll

As requested, here are two examples of how the proposed G.I.A.S.
poll might be covered by reporters. The first is a "worst case"
story and the second is a “best case” story. In order to flash
out the news reports, I did the following:

o Assumed the poll is released through the Vietnam
Veterans Association.

o Made up names for all parties involved, with the
exception of the Tobacco Institute.

o Plugged in results for the poll questions.

SUBJECT: MINUTES OF MARCH 10, 1982 P.D.C. MEETING

The following paragraphs summarize our discussions:

1. SALES REVIEW – Our 1981 experience with the A.I.D. program and a comparison of it with the newly announced Philip Morris program were discussed. Other competitive activities reviewed included Brown and Williamson’s Plan I Bonus program and additional give-aways; R. J. Reynolds' seemingly endless spending spree including the 10% bonus for exclusive Plan II’s, the K-Mart exclusive pack sales deal, and increased payments for out-of-home.

2. ESTABLISHED BRANDS – Advertising flighting schedules for all brands were reviewed. The decision to promote NEWPORT RED in two than the previously announced six markets was announced; as was the upgrading of Florida, Texas, and California to core status on NEWPORT parent later this year. Also reviewed were the new promotion plans for parent KENT utilizing the spring-summer-fall events.

Discussions on TRUE centered mainly on the application of laser technology and the apparent success of the new marketing activities. The GOLDEN LIGHTS ULTRA and MAX SLIM LIGHTS projects were exists.

3. NEW BRANDS – Heritage has been withdrawn from the Jackson market; support will continue in Lexington where a 0.47% S.O.M. currently exists. REBEL continues to perform very well in Erie and fair in Roanoke. Possibilities of a home package at the metro area test will be two topics for discussion at the “next steps” meeting to be held in three or four weeks. An up-date is attached.

THE SATIN CONCEPT/PRODUCT TEST results were reviewed and everything looks extremely promising for this brand.

Project LCC

7/19/93

Currently, eight styles of Project LCC cigarettes are being considered for potential entry in the deep discount segment of the market. Product specifications for the full flavor filter kings version have been established and models prepared for consumer testing near Austin. Design parameters for the eight styles are shown below:

Style Size Configuration “Tar” Delivery
Target
Nonfilter Kings 84 mm x 24.8 mm circumference 22-24
Full Flavor Kings 83 mm x 24.7 mm circumference 13
20 mm filter - 24 mm tipping
Full Flavor Menthol Kings (same as Full Flavor Kings) 13
Lights Kings 83 mm x 24.7 mm circumference 9
25 mm filter - 30 mm tipping
Full Flavor 100’s 99 mm x 24.4 mm circumference 15
31 mm filter - 35 mm tipping
Lights 100’s (same as Full Flavor 100’s) 10
Lights Menthol 100’s (same as Full Flavor 100’s) 10
Ultra Lights 100’s (same as Full Flavor 100’s) 5

Product specifications should be established for all brand styles. Menthol delivery target for full flavor kings and lights menthol 100’s is 0.075 mg per puff. As you know, the tobacco blend formulation for LCC cigarettes is new and different from our other formulations. We must be very diligent and careful in establishing menthol application to foil to achieve desired menthol content to smoke.

We will require two cartons of each style packaged in white wrapping materials for Management approval.

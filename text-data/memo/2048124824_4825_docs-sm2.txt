subject: Capital Appropriation Request
Fabriques de Tabac Reunies (Switzerland)
New Research and Development Building at Neuchatel
SF 20,097,000 (U.S. $12,180,000 at U.S. $ = SF 1.65)

Authority Requested

Philip Morris International requests approval from the Board of Directors for Fabriques de Tabac Reunies to spend SF 20,097,000 (U.S. $12,180,000) for the design, construction and installation of laboratory equipment and furniture for a new Research and Development building in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Previously authorized expenditures of SF 600,000 (U.S. $367,000) for engineering study and design are included in the above figure.

Background

The proposed Research and Development center in Neuchatel will provide services for the entire European Region as regional affiliates have only quality control departments. The projected growth in European production (from 76.8 billion cigarettes in 1979 to 157.6 billion in 1984) and the development of new brands and the addition of new technology will require greater and more complex services from the R&D Department in the future.

The R&D Department currently employs 121 people located in six separate buildings providing a total area of 24,866 square feet. Three of these buildings are rented outside the main PTR manufacturing complex. The physical decentralization of the R&D function is believed by management to have a negative impact on current and potential performance, particularly in light of the projected departmental expansion.

Proposal

After consideration of available alternatives, local management recommends construction of a new building with elimination of four of six existing buildings presently in use. This will centralize the R&D Department and provide 38,000 square feet and 20-30 square feet of laboratory and office space. It will accommodate approximately 150 employees and allow for future expansion. The new facility will be located on PTR property adjacent to the existing manufacturing complex.

Total cost is estimated at SF 20,097,000 (U.S. $12,180,000) including land, building, equipment and installation.

From: A. L. Goldin
Subject: Studies on puff volumes, intervals, durations and frequencies

Attached is the information you requested or order research into the effects of cigarette delivery of puff parameters such as volume, duration, and frequency (or interval). The information you desire is most likely contained in documents such as the first two internal report titled size, known 5-4 will contain the average smoking parameters and deliveries for comment on the standard machine procedure. The first set of documents were created by requiring the presence of both the word “duration” and the word “volume.” In some cases these studies provide information; I also located several other permutations of key variable puff volume, frequency, etc. you will find them indexed as 7-11.

The attached references (with abstracts where available) are from the CIARUB database of internal reports and correspondence.

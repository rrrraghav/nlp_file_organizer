PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
32-74-00- A. Ricky Smith 5350 Poplar Ave. Ste 415, Memphis, TN 38119

June 2, 1997

To: Jacque Gilbert
From: A. Ricky Smith
Subject: Garnishment Papers Served at District Office

Jacque, this is a result of a former part-time Kelly employee. Her name is Paula Grace. It has been over a month since she has worked out of this office. I accepted these papers because I was told by the server that if I didn’t I could be held in contempt of court. Let me know if there is anything that I need to do to clear this matter up.

Regards,
Ricky

TO: R. William Murray DATE: January 14, 1985
FROM: Elizabeth Butson
SUBJECT: LOW SIDESTREAM ISSUE DRAFT

There is no doubt that today a major issue facing our industry is social acceptability. Anti-smoking groups are making smokers feel uncomfortable about smoking. This is especially true of the US, Canada, Australia, and a number of Western European countries.

One can hardly miss that in 1974 only nine countries had laws restricting smoking. Today the number has reached to approximately 40.
It is not surprising then, that in this climate, when 26 new product ideas were tested by R&D in Richmond (March, 1984) the top five concepts that won were:

1. Ultra-low tar version of a popular full-flavor brand
2. No visible smoke
3. Resealable foil paper
4. 25 cigarettes per pack
5. Non-lighting cigarette

LAUNCH OF PASSPORT

The launch of Passport in Canada has demonstrated an interest on the part of the consumer. It was perceived as a means to reduce social pressures and express consideration for others. However, even though smokers noticed that the cigarette produced significantly less smoke, the personal benefits were not sufficient:

—The product had an off taste and, therefore, was not liked.
—The smoke exhaled was visible.
—The heavy ash on the cigarette created concern.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Committee of Counsel
FROM: Robert J. Lewis
RE: Reconciliation Bill

Senator Metzenbaum may offer, as an amendment to S. 1730 the Senate Reconciliation Bill, two changes to the language of the Helms-Ford tobacco bill as it is included in S. 1730 - one relating to the negotiated buy-out, the other relating to antitrust immunity. Senator Helms, through his staff, has asked for the company’s reaction to the proposed language which is enclosed. Please contact Murray Jones, (202) 224-2803, with any reaction that you may have.

S. 1730 is the pending business of the Senate. This amendment and others, could come up at any time.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

TO C. H. Mullen - Vice President - Sales




FROM E. J. Gesell - Product Manager



LUCKY STRIKE Filters Military Promotional/Publicity Budget



As discussed, following is a proposed execution outline for the recently approved $93,000 military promotional/publicity budget.

Each Sales Manager would be advised of the dollars budgeted for his area.

One major military installation in each field would be selected by the S.M. and targeted for promotional effort - a trial effort to "break-in" the program.

Coordination by the SDM of at least the first event in each area is proposed, rationale: his familiarity with the overall program concept from the San Diego meeting.

In presentation to the Base Recreation officer he should use copies of the letters sent to Spec Henderson thanking us for our participation in the San Diego/Atlanta events (see attached) as well as copies of the newspaper advertising that we've run in support of earlier events (see attached).

Review the base activities i.e. softball, bowling, football tournaments, etc. and select the activity with the greatest impact. While we cannot sponsor an event, we can support an event and receive credit on all promotional materials. For example: 10th Annual All-Services Invitational Bowling Tournament supported by LUCKY STRIKE Filters (see attached).

Proposal is to be submitted through FSM and MSM to NYO and should include the following:

(a) Sponsorship costs outlining details i.e. prizes, flyers, etc.

(b) Name of base newspaper or newspapers - ad placement would be handled through NYO.

(c) Number of sample packs of 10's required.

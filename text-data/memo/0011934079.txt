SUBJECT: DOUBLE COUPON ON COFFIN BRANDS

Attached is a copy of Bob Pittman's May 2, 1975 memo regarding the safety to ensure question on the paper we use for ROLL-FEED RELIAF coupons.

It is my understanding from Mrs. Beasly that the week
of May 19th will be spent in testing during the week
of May 19.

It is suggested that we proceed immediately to do the following:

1) Get International Playing Card & Label Company
to supply a plain white non-safety paper supplied
by Northwest.

2) For the test market, it is my suggestion that we
make arrangements with them to print the same form that
we are presently using on our labels. We will need
International Playing Card & Label Com-
pany to furnish us with a sample of the
paper for our further testing.  We will also need
International Playing Card & Label Company should also make arrangements to do the
composition on the 8-ens chati which will go into each
carton.

Both of these should be pursued immediately, realizing that
even if we have to use a different paper, it is not
satisfactory the first time, we will owe to Kraft Bryan
and his team to find out what they are doing and see if
we can have a lot of a double coupon value. This opinion
is based on urgency to proceed with the project as
soon as possible.

If you disagree with this, please let me know imme-
diately.

Lary Bryan

SUBJECT Duolite Filter Rod Waste

A two (2) day study was conducted, on first shift only, to determine the waste level of 100% duolite loaded filter rods. The study was conducted on Duolite filter rod makers No. 543 and 541, located on the second floor of No. 4 building. Only finished rejected rods containing Duolite were counted as waste and any waste that occurred after finished rods were trayed was not included in the data.

The results of this study are shown in the table below.

Total running time (minutes) 719.5
Rods per minute per machine 504
Total rods possible 362,124
Total rods waste 20,457
Percent waste 5.65
Projected waste per machine per shift 10,692 rods @ 85%
machine efficiency.

Projected Duolite waste per machine per shift - 3.84 lbs.

Subject: Nicotine retention

Attached you will find references (with abstracts where available) of previous inquiries into the issue of nicotine retention by the smoker. The most comprehensive research into inhalation behavior appears to be that done by the Behavioral Research Laboratory in 1982 [3], but it stopped short of rigorously measuring nicotine retention although it reviewed the literature and proposed a methodology for conducting just such experiments. The Behavioral Research Division seems to have been dismantled or reorganized shortly thereafter, as there are no further reports from it other than 5 (which does not examine nicotine retention). An earlier, less comprehensive experiment it was found that even moderate inhalation reduced the level of exhaled nicotine below detectable limits [4]. The literature review in 3 explores the hypothesis of nicotine self-titration, whereby it is suggested that smokers modify their inhalation behavior to regulate nicotine delivery. Finally, report 6 discusses the effect of pH on smoke impact.

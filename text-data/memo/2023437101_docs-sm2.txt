Re: Boycott

Next Tuesday, April 19, the critic will launch its nationwide boycott of your company in 25 cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Chicago and Los Angeles. Although not specifically mentioned, we can infer that one of the sites will be Richmond, given that the launch coincides with your annual shareholders' meeting. Attached is an embargoed press release summarizing the effort.

The critic claims it will delay boycotting your competitor until later this year, making your company the primary focus of the boycott at this time.

The critic is asking consumers to boycott what they perceive to be your company’s most profitable and heavily advertised products and subsidiaries: Kraft, Miller, General Foods, Jacobs Suchard, Oscar Mayer, Post, Kool-Aid, Kraft Food Services, Jell-O, and Maxwell House. Please note that many of these products (e.g., Jell-O, Oscar Mayer, etc.) are marketed to children -- producing a tie-in with the focus of the critic’s campaign.

Press kits containing bumper stickers, petition sign-up sheets, company profiles, postcards, and other background material will be distributed by the critic. We expect to receive these materials shortly and will overnight them to you this afternoon.

Subject: Thirty-Four Millimeter Tipping for Marlboro 100’s:
Comparison of 4 NTI Test Results

Background:

The purpose of these tests was to determine the consumer acceptability of four experimental Marlboro 100's with different 34mm tipping papers relative to current production Marlboro 100’s with its 30mm tipping. The table below both identifies and describes the experimental cigarettes tested:

RT# Identification: Description:
2234/2235 Original 30mm tipping consisting of 27mm cork paper, and a 7mm “white” extension on which the brand name was printed.

2236/2237 White Cork 30mm tipping consisting of 27mm cork paper, and a 7mm "plain white" extension on which the brand was printed.

2238/2239 Cork and Grey 30mm tipping consisting of 27mm cork paper, and a 7mm “grey” extension on which the brand name was printed.

2240/2241 All Cork A full 34mm cork tipping in lieu of the usual 30mm. The brand name was printed on the rod itself, and not the tipping paper.

Analytically, all of the experimental Marlboro 100’s delivered both lower tar (about 1 1/2ng.) and nicotine (about 0.1ng.) than the production version. This can be attributed primarily to the longer length of the experimental cigarettes tipping papers.

These tests were conducted among a group of 100 non-smoker filter smokers (excluding Marlboro 100’s) with a pre-selection of Marlboro prospects would be tested among Marlboro 100's smokers.

The first test (Experimental with the Original tipping) is a repeat of an earlier one (RTI# 2184/2185) done in which it was determined that this experimental product was acceptable to the cross-section of 100mm smokers (40/51), 27 preferring the current production version. We have no data on these smoker groups and are unable to attribute any qualitative differences between the experimental cigarettes to the date with production service, however, caution must be used in these group because of the relatively small sample sizes (approximately 100 smokers per experiment).

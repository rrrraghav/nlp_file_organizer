1. LORILLARD SALES TRENDS:

NEWPORT - Growth continues for all box packings, which many times out sell soft counter parts. This is especially true in and around the college community of East Lansing.

OLD GOLD – Sales have reached a plateau. This is a combination of our attention on Maverick and the competitive strong promotional and buy down values in the price value category. The full flavor packages continue to sell the best with Menthol Light 100’s at the other end of the spectrum at a virtual standstill.

MAVERICK – Slowly showing steady and consistent growth in all classes of trade and geographic areas. The brand responds well when predominately advertised and when there is not a great deal of cigarette promotion saturation in the immediate area.

KENT – Overall sales have increased, especially by the carton. This is due in large part by the lucrative coupon offer. However, there are reports by retailers that this brand is occasionally being purchased in high volume carton outlets even without a discount.

TRUE – There are pockets in this division with good carton sales. Overall, however, this brand family’s sales remain flat.

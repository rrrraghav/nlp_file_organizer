Re: Peterson meeting 9 a.m., April 10

We’ve had five reviews of "Helping Youth Decide" from Jim Peterson -- three of them from the University of the District of Columbia! -- and he may be bringing in another one or two on Thursday for our 9 a.m. meeting.

Sam will be in town after all and will try to make the meeting, according to Deb Thomas.

The reviewers think HYD not helpful enough to kids, too glossy and expensive looking, too filled with "perfect family" pictures and aimed too obviously at what one calls the brie and croissants set.

No single parent families are pictured, they say, no messy hair, no dirty fingernails. A UDC professor of counseling and mental health complains about the adolescents pictured: “Their ‘growing pains’ might merit a couple of aspirins from time to time, but that's about all.”

There are comparatively few negative feelings about the text, some constructive suggestions and both good and impossible, for us, ideas for future promotion and projects. Almost all suggested additional materials addressed to youth and opined that concepts and suggestions in HYD about/for early teens might be presented too late to benefit either parent or child.

One guesses at least two reviewers, those submitting the most thoughtful and comprehensive reports -- Jensen, who is big in Mormonism, and Mendelsohn, a one-time TI witness -- would be very interested in joining in any follow-up projects.

Interestingly, most were impressed with the HYD parent-child questionnaires. And I must report here the HYD evaluation survey, in house in draft form, found few parents and children ever filled them out! Reviewer Mendelsohn has a whole retail promotion planned around them.

Here is a thumbnail of the best reviewer recommendations:

SUBJECT: WRA Quarterly Meeting - May 14 & 15, 1997

Thank you for agreeing to present at the upcoming WRA Quarterly Meeting on the topic: "Legal Systems Compared and Contrasted: USA; Europe; and English Common Law". I confirm that Mark will present on the USA; Michael on Europe;
and myself on English Common Law.

Attached is an outline of the suggested topics to be covered in each presentation. A uniform structure will aid our audience in making the comparisons and contrasts.

Each presentation should be for 20 minutes (including questions).

We intend to invite to the meeting the Legal Departments of PM USA, Corporate
and PMI.

Please let me know if you have any questions concerning the presentation. Also, please let me know the format in which you intend to present (e.g. overheads, computer, slides, video, etc.)

Regards.

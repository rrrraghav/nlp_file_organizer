SUBJECT: FULL MARGIN COMPETITIVE COUPON ACTIVITY

Attached is the latest competitive supermarket coupon information (through March 24,
1991) as reported by various data sources. Note: Media-delivered couponing
information as reported by the Advertising Checking Bureau is currently available
through February.

SUMMARY

* RJR reduced the overall level of coupon support behind their Full Margin brands.
This shift was driven by reductions in on-carton/in-store couponing.

* Philip Morris’ Full Margin couponing increased versus a year-ago due to the various
Fourth Quarter 1990 Direct Mail programs for Marlboro, Merit and Benson & Hedges.

* Lorillard significantly increased coupon support behind Newport, Kent and True. Importantly, this higher value coupon activity has had a positive impact on the
brands’ share performance in the supermarket trade class (as reported by the
InfoScan Rapid Fact data base). In addition, Lorillard is using a new coupon delivery
system: Register Receipt Coupons which delivers $5.00 coupons for Newport to
consumers at retail.

* American and Brown & Williamson are focusing their couponing efforts behind their
Price Value/Sub-Genaric brands and have consequently reduced support for the
manufacturers’ Full Margin businesses.

HIGHLIGHTS

* Supermarket Full Margin couponing trends continue to be driven primarily by R.J.
Reynolds (40% of volume sold on coupon) and Lorillard's recent emphasis behind
their Full Margin brands (37% of volume) for the four-week period ending March
24th. However, note that RJR’s Full Margin couponing has lost momentum during
First Quarter 1991. Still, RJR’s percent volume sold on coupon for the
manufacturer is down from a high of 51% at the end of 1990 to its current level of
40%. Price Value couponing for R.J. Reynolds remained stable at around 62%
during First Quarter 1991.

* Couponing for RJR’s Full Margin brands declined primarily as a result of decreasing
in-store/on-carton coupon activity. For the most current four-week period, the
percent of stores with on-carton couponing Winsten decreased .24 points to 14% versus
the prior period. Salem, 27 points to 16%; L&M - .27 points to 17%; and Vantage,
.24 points to 18%.

* Philip Morris’ Full Margin couponing increased due to coupon activity for Newport, the
dominant leader (35%) among smokers using coupons. Marlboro couponing is being
supported by a variety of programs including: Direct Mail, Register Receipt, Free
Sample and Event Marketing. Merit couponing continues to be supported by .25/10c
coupons with a 1990 expiration date. Benson & Hedges couponing is driven by
newspaper inserts (34%) and free sample distributions. Philip Morris’ Full Margin
couponing represents 32% of volume sold on coupon during the four-week period
ending March 24, 1991.

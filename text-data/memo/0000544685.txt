FINAL REPORT
SCREENING OF SELF-LIQUIDATOR ITEMS
PROJECTS H-374-105; TASK #2711-11

Background

Seven studies were conducted to screen items being considered
for inclusion in the self-liquidator program.  Across the approximate detail
level of each study, the retail cost was the approximate detail
factor.  For each study consisted of approximately 650 cigarette smokers
who were selected from a mailing list and interviewed during
January-February 1975.

The studies were conducted by mailing color print illustrating
and describing the items to cigarette smokers who believe to
be representative of the population.  Respondents rated each item
on the likelihood of buying at the retail cost. The following
scale was used for rating their desire to buy each item.

"If you saw the item in a store where you
were shopping, would you..."

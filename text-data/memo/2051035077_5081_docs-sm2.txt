Subject: "Gunsroke" Cigarettes - Star Tobacco Company

Star Tobacco Company claims their new cigarette Gunsroke contains high quality 100% Natural Tobacco with no fillers or reconstituted tobacco (See Attached News Release).

The cigarettes were examined microscopically to determine the various blend components.

The cigarete blends contained up to 19% reconstituted tobacco. Based on a consultation with Dick Uhl and F Swaim it was agreed that the reconstituted tobacco was made of large pieces of tobacco stems that appear to have been flaked or expanded and adhered together by a binder (Figure 1). Figure 2 (cross sectional view) shows the layering effect of the reconstituted tobacco.

The material was disintegrated in water to observe the particle size. Figures 3 and 4 show a comparison of the particle size of the Gunsroke reconstituted tobacco vs Philip Morris RL sheet. In figure 5 note a "jelly like" film (binder) used to adhere the stem particles. Further analytical investigation of this material has been initiated.

The blend contained no expanded tobacco or expanded stems. The lamina portion of the blends appeared overall darker in color when compared to typical domestic filter. Some pieces appeared charred, (Figures 6 and 7).

A similar blend and type of reconstituted tobacco was seen previously in March, 1993 during an examination of tobacco blends picked up in Canada and submitted by the Tobacco-Technology Group (See attached memo from George Morgan).

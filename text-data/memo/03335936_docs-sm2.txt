Lorillard

MEMORANDUM August 9, 1976

TO: All Concerned

FROM: Larry Dulude

RE: G & R IMPACT STUDIES

For some time, the Research Department has been concerned that the G & R
Data is not an effective tool for improving Lorillard’s advertising. There
appear to be 2 reasons for this problem: 1) the data does not have the con-
sistency necessary for clear direction, and 2) the data is just not being used.

Accordingly, we are recommending the discontinuance of the G & R service
as of September 1. We will be investigating alternative methods of measuring
the effectiveness of our advertising during the coming months. Due to the
terms of our contract with G & R, their service will continue through the end
of the year.

If you feel that we should continue to subscribe to the G & R service,
please let me know before the end of August.

L.D.

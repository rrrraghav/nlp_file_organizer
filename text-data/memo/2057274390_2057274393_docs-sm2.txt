Subject: Structural and Elemental Documentation of Ca₂(OH)₂(PO₄)e, CaHPO₄·2H₂O, and CaHPO₄

Three dry powder chemicals were submitted for structural and elemental determinations.

Sample #8750-90-A, Ca₂(OH)₂(PO₄)e, contained round particles 0.02 -
0.13μ in diameter (Figure 2). These particles formed clumps up to 3.0μ in
diameter (Figure 1). The particles contained P and Ca (Figure 3).

Sample #8750-90-B, CaHPO₄·2H₂O, contained two different crystal
structures (Figures 4, 5). The first was round in shape and 0.05 - 0.17μ in
diameter (Figure 6). The second type was very angularly-shaped crystals.
These were from 0.17 - 50μ in length and 0.07 - 21μ in width (Figures 4, 6).
Both particle types contained P and Ca (Figure 7).

Sample #8750-90-C, CaHPO₄, contained very angular, equant crystals from
1 - 37μ in size (Figure 8). On the surfaces of some of these crystals
small, round and equant shaped particles were noted from 0.02 - 0.08μ in
size (Figure 9). The crystals contained P and Ca (Figure 10).

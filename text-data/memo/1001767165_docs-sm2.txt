RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Dr. A. Bayley√ date: October 18, 1962
From: R. H. Blackmore Project No. 8207

Subject: Cigarette Certification Samples

The cigarettes for the prescribed tests are to be taken
from 10 cartons. The three experimental cigarettes will be
taken from 10 cartons out of cold storage, and cigarettes coded
#872F manufactured October 16, 1962 will be fresh cigarettes.

Competitive brand cigarettes will be obtained from the
10 jobbers supplying the C. I. Samples, one carton from each
jobber. These cigarettes already are at the Research Center
(arrived this week).

Dr. Sellgman informed me that 20 cartons of new 872P
cigarettes will be sent to the Center this week. He does not
believe cigarettes coded 854A (new extremely high porosity
paper) will be ready this week.

Therefore, we plan to ship the cigarettes to U. S. Testing
for the T.P.M., nicotine and total R.T.D. analysis as soon as
code 872P arrives at the Center. One pack from each of the
ten cartons will be sent to U. S. Testing.

Cigarettes for exit temperature, phenol, furfural,
humectant and moisture in filter will be taken from the same
10 carton sample. Where the data is not available, analysis
will be carried out at the Research Center. Experimental work
will start immediately. It is estimated that all the analyses
except phenols will be completed by November 9 providing no
unforeseen delays arise.

PHILIP MORRIS INCORPORATED
INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Dr. A. J. Kasseman Date: January 7, 1981
From: Dr. B. Losee
Subject: PLANS AND OBJECTIVES FOR 1981 - PROJECT 1706 – TOBACCO PHYSICS

I. OBJECTIVE: To study and develop means of altering delivery characteristics of cigarettes through changes in the basic pyrolysis/ combustion processes that occur in a burning cigarette.

PLANS

1. Identify the relationship which may exist between coal tempera-
ture and gas phase delivery. Target: 2nd quarter, 1981

2. Evaluate effects that free radical initiators have on CO evolution
process. Target: 2nd quarter, 1981

3. Determine whether surface active carbon sites on cigarette char
are controlling (significant) factors in high temperature com-
bustion. Target: 4th quarter, 1981

4. Determine importance of high temperature inorganic salt evolution
process on aerosol formation. Target: 4th quarter, 1981

5. Determine the importance of CO2 reduction as a major source of
high temperature CO. Target: 1st quarter, 1981

6. Contingent on 5 above evaluate the potential importance of concept
for CO/TPM control. Target: 1st quarter, 1981

7. Determine using pre-existing cigarette probing data velocity
profiles in a burning cigarette. Target: 2nd quarter, 1981

II. OBJECTIVE: To apply technology derived from Project to problems related to ignition of tobacco and/or other substrates.

PLANS

1. Evaluate importance of auto-oxidation processes in self heating
of tobacco beds and expansion tower fires.
Target: 3rd quarter, 1981

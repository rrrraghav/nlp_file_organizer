LORILLARD SALES TRENDS

Maverick Specials - We continue to gain distribution and volume in General Market C-Stores and Gas Stations as well as Cigarette Stores and Tax Differential outlets. Package sales are still growing in Urban Special Emphasis Calls. The Menthol packings are now becoming firmly established, and the 100 MM packings are becoming the best sellers overall. We continue to enjoy an average 10¢ price advantage in most retail outlets vs. Doral and GPC.

Newport - The Box packings continue to grow throughout the area. In many cases Newport Box Pack retailers Newport Soft, Newport Light Box 80’s continue to experience excellent increases in sales and distribution. Most retailers are maintaining larger inventories which aids in excellent increased competitive trial. The Light Box 100's are also benefiting from renewed trial.

Kent/True - Each of these brand families continue to decline in sales with the exception of the Kent Heavy-Up in Region 17. This program allows Kent to maintain sales.

Old Gold - Sales in Region 25 have decreased dramatically due to the elimination of promotional support. Retailers report there are some brand loyal consumers who are continuing to purchase the brand without a coupon.

Style - Clean-Up Program achieved our objectives, and the buy-down in the volume accounts moved the remaining inventory through in a timely manner.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

to: Mr. R. N. Crockett Date Feb. 2, 1977

from: F. W. Forsmark
subject: 16 HHD’s of RCW with 25% increase of NH3 and DIP
13 HHD's of PCW with 25% increase of NH3

Now we have 16 HHD’s of RCW made on October 11,
1976 with a 25% increase of NH3 and DIP in the solution.
All testing and evaluations are complete (see R. Powe's
letter to W. J. Wilkening dated November 24, 1976). I
feel we would be justified re-labeling these hogsheads
WZECH and shipping them out for the following reasons:

1. No significant differences could be detected in the
sheets physical characteristics.

2. No significant differences could be found in the
sheets chemical analysis and the nitrate levels
of the sheets were down to 0.55% which indicates
good burley stem washing.

3. No significant taste differences were detected by
the Flavor Development Group between Marlboro
cigarettes made with this sheet and the control.

We also have 13 HHD’s of PCW made on November 27,
1976 with a 25% increase of NH3. All testing and evaluations
are complete on this product and I feel we should also
re-label these hogsheads WZECH and treat them as regular
production.

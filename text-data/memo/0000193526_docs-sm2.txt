KOOL SUPER NIGHTS

KOOL Super Nights, starring Mel Torme, Sarah Vaughan and Gerry Mulligan will be held in Milwaukee at the Performing Arts Center on March 23 at 7:00 P.M. and 10:30 P.M.

The KOOL Super Nights events have been designed to appeal to the white, upscale, older, more sophisticated audiences – the KOOL Super Lights’ target audience.

Everything involved with the KOOL Super Nights concerts has been carefully planned to provide KOOL Super Lights with a “classy” and sophisticated image.

Media Support

R.O.P. ads announcing the concert will be run in the Milwaukee Journal on February 23, March 4 and 11.

All local press and media will be provided publicity and news releases regarding KOOL Super Nights.

Direct Mailing

An attractive announcement of the KOOL Super Nights concert and a rare, redeemable coupon will be sent to 35,000 residents in upscale areas of Milwaukee prior to March 29 by Dennelley Marketing, Inc. A sample of the mailer is attached.

P.O.P. Material

We have developed special KOOL Super Nights posters for the event. When you receive them, please begin to place the posters in all types of stores in upscale suburban locations as you make your calls. Please try to have your posters placed before ARTIC LIGHTS retail work begins on the 26th.

A total of 300 heavy gauge posters which advertise the show in Milwaukee will arrive at your Division Manager’s advertising address the week of March 5.

An adequate supply will be distributed to you by our Division manager.

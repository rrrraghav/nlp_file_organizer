Subject: KOOL Super Lights’ Advertising Support

Attached are KOOL Super Lights' Local Market Activity sheets for each Trading Area. These sheets summarize the extent, timing, and variety of KOOL Super Lights’ local market advertising for each selected market by Trading Area. It is felt that this information could be a useful selling tool for the Sales Force. This information does, however, comprise the heart of the KOOL Super Lights media plan in 1978 and is, therefore, highly confidential. May I suggest that Department Managers receive only those Trading Area sheets which coincide with his geographic responsibility in order to insure against the possibility of the total plan inadvertently falling into the wrong hands?

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments about these documents. Thank you.

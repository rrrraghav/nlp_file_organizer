REQUEST FOR MARKET RESEARCH

TO: F. Chong L.E. Gravely
CC: R.R. Black K.J. Brotge
FROM: D. V. Cantrell
DATE: February 2, 1995
SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR CPT OF MOIST SNUFF PRODUCTS /271

Subject To Be Researched:

R&D developed a new Straight flavored moist snuff candidate (recipe “D”) which when tested at Dupont among Copenhagen users resulted in a solid party to Copenhagen. This recipe was adopted for production of Diamond Back Straight for Military sales. Presently, all the inventory of candidate "D" product has been depleted for production of Diamond Back.

A second candidate, “G”, was recently tested at Dupont versus candidate “D” among Copenhagen users. Results show “G” to be numerically preferred (54% to 46%) with supporting attributes. Candidate “G” differs from “D” by having a higher level of licorice and no added saccharin. Candidate "G" is now being used for maintaining Diamond Back Straight production for Military sales.

Research Objectives:

* The purpose for requesting a CPT test of candidate “G” versus Copenhagen is to measure its acceptability among Copenhagen users in a broader geographic area and among a larger sample base than is currently possible with Dupont testing.

* If results are acceptable, candidate "G" would become a “back-up” recipe for the expected September test market of a new moist snuff brand for B&W. In March and April 1995, R&D will be Dupont and CPT testing further development recipes of Fine Cut and Long Cut moist snuff using more properly aged, non-red dark fired leaf tobacco. These latter recipes are expecting to perform better than candidate “G”. Test market timing, however, requires testing candidate "G" now and then await the Dupont and CPT results of the new product recipes (currently undergoing fermentation).

Consumer Groups To Be Represented:

Among male Copenhagen users aged 21-35 years of age.

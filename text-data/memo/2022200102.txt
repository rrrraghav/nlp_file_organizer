Subject: Nicotine Delivery of Favor When Lit!

An experiment was run to determine the amount of nicotine that might be delivered to a consumer if a Favor (nonburning article) were lit by mistake. The nicotine delivery averaged 50 micrograms per puff and ranged from zero to 160 micrograms per puff. The differences were in the number of puffs taken and the intensity of heating in the attempt to light the device. For comparison, Cambridge 85 cigarettes average around 20 micrograms and Marlboro 85 averages approximately 140 micrograms per puff nicotine delivery.

The experiment was done using a single port smoking machine. A 35cc, 2 sec. puff was used and lighting attempts were made with a butane lighter. One or two heated puffs on one or two Favor articles were taken for eight trials. The nicotine was collected on Cambridge pads that had been treated with NaHSO3 to improve trapping efficiency.² Nicotine determination was done by extraction and GC analysis.

The data show a large amount of scatter which is attributed to the range of heating and the number of times a single Favor device was heated and puffed. It is logical to believe that consumers would also experience a range of nicotine deliveries due to their persistence in attempting to light the device, their tolerance to the noxious plastic vapors, and the size of the puff taken. The concern that large amounts of the roughly 10 milligrams of nicotine available for inhalation would be transferred was tested by this experiment. Because large (over 1 milligram) amounts of nicotine were not found to be delivered, further experiments in this area are not planned.

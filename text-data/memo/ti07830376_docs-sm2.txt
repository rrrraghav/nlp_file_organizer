MEMORANDUM

TO: Anne Durkin, Robert Sievers

FR: Peter G. Spanos

I appreciated the report on reader responses to our TVU
subscription renewal effort and, as you can see by the attached
memorandum, have passed it along to Messrs. Chilcote and Klopier.

Please note my recommendations and the follow-up activity
outlined in that memorandum.

If Sam and Bill concur with my recommendation, I will tell you
immediately until it is resolved, I do not want a full mailing
authorized.

In terms of your follow-up assignments, I would like your
thoughts and recommendations by November 13.

Sorry for putting this in memo form. I am in the office this
morning for just a few hours and wanted to communicate with you
as quickly as possible.

I am easily reached. Call if you have need for clarification.

thanks.

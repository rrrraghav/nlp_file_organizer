SUBJECT: Determination of Organic Aldehyde Delivery by an Experimental Smokable Article Submitted by D. R. Smart (PROJECT B 491, 10)

Introduction

Samples of a prototype smokable article (hereinafter called "experimental cigarettes") were submitted by D. R. Smart for determination of aldehyde delivery. Kent III cigarettes with the tipping perforations taped were analyzed as a control.

Experimental

Both experimental and control cigarettes were conditioned in the smoking laboratory at standard FTC temperature and humidity conditions for a minimum of 24 hours. The first 5 puffs of each cigarette were collected under standard conditions using a 5 ml puff volume, 2 seconds duration, at one minute intervals, then a clearing puff was taken. The whole smoke was trapped in a 1.25 ml Dreschel bottle containing 50 ml of trapping reagent. The trapping reagent contained 200 ml of 1-nitro-2-propanediol hydrazine (DNHP) in acetonitrile, 20 ml of N perchloric acid diluted to 500 ml with acetonitrile. After smoking, the DMPH smoke solutions were neutralized with 2 ml of 1 N triethylamine.

The DNH complexed smoke solutions were analyzed by HPLC-UV analysis at 360 nm. The Hewlett Packard 1090 M HPLC was equipped with Novapak (C18) column 3.9 x 150 mm, with a 5 µm particle size. The mobile phase was acetonitrile, water, tetrahydro-
(60:30:10) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An injection volume of 10 µl was used. Following each analysis, the column was washed with acetonitrile at 2 ml/min for 30 minutes.

Results

The aldehyde deliveries for the experimental cigarettes verses the Kent III control cigarettes are reported in Table 1. The aldehyde deliveries were substantially less for the experimental cigarettes.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

FR: Peter G. Sparber

RE: Convenience Stores

Some time ago you asked that we consider the feasibility of
working closer with the convenience store industry. As you
then suspected, there is significant potential for coopera-
tion.

Attached is a booklet containing a good deal of background
information on the convenience store industry including
material on the industry’s major association, its largest
20 chains, its most important issues and its dependence on
tobacco products. The booklet also describes efforts -- many
of which are already under way -- to improve our relationship
with the convenience store industry.

If you agree, we will distribute copies of this booklet to
all field staff and others with issues responsibilities. We
will also begin implementation of all projects not already
in progress.

We found this exercise to be quite worthwhile. Therefore,
we are proceeding with similar booklets on the grocery and
restaurant industries and are considering others in the near
future.

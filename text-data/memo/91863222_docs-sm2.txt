MEMORANDUM

7/13/95

TO: M. Borsini

FROM: K. Patakis

SUBJECT: Style Special POS Pricing - Texas Test Market

The following is a list of cost estimates for the Vinyl Decal and 3 piece Mobile which we are considering for the Texas test market. I have also received projected quantities from Sales Planning as listed below.

The costs are as follows:

Item Quantity Cost Per Unit Total Cost
10 1/2" Vinyl Decal 6,600 $7.25 $47,830
3 Piece Mobile 6,000 $5.38 $32,280

The cost per unit listed above is based on a quantity of 2,500. Therefore, the actual cost per unit will probably be slightly lower.

As you are aware, mechanicals for the decal, mobile and dummy pack are currently being developed by Bob DeBlasio. Receipt of the decal and mobile mechanics are expected by July, 24, 1995.

Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions!

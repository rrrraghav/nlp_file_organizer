Records Retention

By now each of you should have received a copy of Mr.
John Reilly’s guidelines concerning our Records
Retention Program.

If you have not yet read and thoroughly understand
these guidelines, please do so immediately.

I have attached a limited number of "Records Transfer
List" (RTL) for your use. If you need more, please
request them through Linda Martin in Greensboro.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Dick

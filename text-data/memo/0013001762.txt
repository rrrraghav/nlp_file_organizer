Subject : Consumer research objectives in the Middle East.

Based on conclusions reached during the meeting between yourself, Y. Beyhum, S. Tabbara and myself on this subject.

Below are the main objectives that should be taken into consideration when conducting consumer research surveys in our region.

Although some of the objectives listed are similar to those that were included for the group sessions, conducted recently in Egypt - Kuwait and Dubai, we need to have more accurate information based on a wider base or sample of the population than the 10 to 12 consumers per group that were interviewed recently (3 in Kuwait, 4 in Cairo and 5 in Dubai).

Our research objectives depend on the brand.

KENT :
- 1. To re-evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the brand visavis Kent and competitive consumers.

- 2. To obtain more accurate quantitative data on Kent and competitive brands consumer profile; sex, age, nationa- lity, profession, etc...

- 3. To investigate in depth the "Tobacco Rumor" it's effect on Kent’s image and it’s possible remedies, in the mind of the consumer.

LOFI flavor brand :
- 1. To test the proposed pack against the Marlboro pack prima- rily and other flavor brands in the market.

- 2. To carry out a blind paired test on the "taste" qualities of the LOFI brand and Marlboro.

- 3. To test consumer acceptance /reaction to the name and pro- posed advertising, copy / layout.

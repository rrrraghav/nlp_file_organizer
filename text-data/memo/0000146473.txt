FROM: F. K. McKeown

SUBJECT: Promotion Response

This responds to your note of 7/23 requesting a review of our promotion response report. I will be addressing only those specific offers for KOOL
and KOOL Super Lights where there are significant differences at projected
redemption versus actual redemption.

On Kool Parent, there are only two offers in this category as follows:

1.  KOOL Country carton offer - projected response 10% - new projection
    14% - this offer was extremely high value with the free carton. I
    feel that it will come in at 14%; the problem is that we had no ex-
    perience in setting our projection.

2.  Free hat offer - as a tape-on worked extremely well. As a mail-
    back it is too early to comment yet because mail-in cards only
    used after tapes are depleted and only 50% of P-O-S has been
    used to date because 7 shows are still to come; will follow up with
    data after all 15 shows completed.

KOOL Super Lights Offer

1.  The national offer on KSL (50¢/2 packs and 50¢(1 pack) has been
    revised based on recent data so that actual redemptions are coming
    in very close to projections.

2.  All remaining offers refer to regional or local tests:

    a. 50¢/2 packs delivered with sample - estimated at 18%
        versus 10% budget - this offer was first considered a
        real problem because of litter with paper cones out
        with packs, now looks to be very efficient via-a-via
        conversion - should be considered for future sampling.

MEMORANDUM

TO: MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

FROM: SAMUEL D. CHILCOTE, JR.



Every week or two we invite a Member of Congress to address
The Institute staff and your Washington office representatives
on current issues. Last week Senator Ford, one of our industry’s
strongest supporters, was our guest.

The Senator chose to speak from a text in which he reaffirmed
his support and included several emphatic descriptions of our
problems as he sees them, and his suggested solutions. I am
enclosing his text for your information.

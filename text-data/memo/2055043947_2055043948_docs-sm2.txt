Subject: AUTO ANALYZER II PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE

OBJECTIVE:

To instruct all Quality Assurance Supervisors, Coordinators and Process
Technicians in the Preventive Maintenance Procedure used to ensure that that channels
of the Auto Analyzers are in good operating condition on a consistent basis.

PROCEDURE FOR NH₄ CHANNEL:

1. Take all reagent lines out of their containers and immerse in a 10% solution
of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Allow solution to flush through channel for
five (5) minutes.

2. Shut the channel down by cutting off-the switch on top of proportioning
pump, cut colorimeter lamp off.

3. Remove pressure plate from the top of the proportioning pump: This is
metal plate that presses down on the pump tubing.

4. Place a piece of tape across the plastic end blocks holding the tubing in
place. Remove and set end blocks with pump tubing aside.

5. Replace rails that lay across roller chain assay. Clean with kim wipes
and check for wear. If rails need to be replaced, do so, with new ones. If
not, lubricate with small amount of Semi-fluid lubricant and place back on
proportioning pump.

6. Place plastic end blocks and pump tubing back on proportioning pump and
remove tape.

7. Replace old pump tubing, one at a time, with new by matching the color of
each tube.

8. Take old dialysis membrane off the dialyzer block by unscrewing bolts with
torque wrench. Replace with new membrane by carefully setting it on top of
the bottom portion of dialyzer block. Punch holes in membrane where bolts
are to enter bottom of dialyzer block and carefully place top portion of
block on. Screw bolts in until the torque wrench clicks.

9. Immerse all reagents lines in freshly made diluent water.

10. Place pressure plate on proportioning pump. Turn pump and colorimeter on
Allow channel to flush for five (5) minutes.

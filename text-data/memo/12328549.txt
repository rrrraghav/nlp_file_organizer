KOOL WORK PLAN

Bob Swartz, Area Promotion Manager - Northeast, has
developed the enclosed KOOL work plan for your use in
the field-directed KOOL promotion.

As you know, many of the promotions you will be offering
this year will be "field-directed." This means that
they were developed, scheduled, and funded by your Sales
Department.

It is particularly important, then, that each of us
helps ensure that all budgets, consumer incentives, and
P.O.P. materials are utilized efficiently and properly
monitored.

Thanked for your support and your efforts.

If you have any questions, please contact Bob Swartz at
(215) 565-8635.

Subject: SM Assay - Comparison of X6D5BFR (control) to X6D5BFS (test)



Two cigarette types, a control filler sprayed with water (X6D5BFR), and a control filler (X6D5BFS) sprayed with an additive (M100A), were submitted for testing in the SM assay (1). The objective of this experiment was to determine if a decrease in the amount of M100A added to the filler from a previous experiment (2) would show a significant difference between the test sample and the control. Previous results (2) showed that the control filler + additive had a significantly higher specific activity (S.A.) than control filler water. Four replicate smokings of these samples were carried out by members of Charge No. 6908 (3).



The IT CSC’s from the replicate smokings (prepared as 10 mg/ml stock solutions in DMSO) were tested randomly in strain TA98+S9 according to the standard procedure (4,5) using doses of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 mg CSC/plate. The control data from this experiment were within normal ranges.



(Table 1 shows the analysis of variance on the experimental results performed using “Minitab”). Statistically, there was no difference between the control and the test sample. This result implies that this compound to filler at a lower level may not have a significant effect on activity. However, it should be noted that except for smoking 3, all of the S.A.’s for the test sample were higher than the S.A.’s of the control. The resulting mean S.A. for the test samples would reflect the variation in smoking 3. Therefore, a repeat experiment and perhaps even more smokings would be needed to verify these results. The average CSC yield/cigarette was the same for each cigarette type (Table 1).

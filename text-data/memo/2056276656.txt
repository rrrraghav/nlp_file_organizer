SUBJECT: FDA Update/Industry News Conference

As you may be aware, today was the final day to submit comments to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the agency’s plan to regulate the marketing and sale of cigarettes. The agency received hundreds of thousands of comments, a majority of which opposed the FDA's proposed regulations.

Today in Washington, we at Philip Morris joined The Tobacco Institute and other members of the tobacco industry at a news conference, during which we made public our comments to the FDA.

Speaking on behalf of the industry, I restated the industry’s commitment to preventing minors from having access to cigarettes. I also outlined the numerous reasons why we believe the FDA's plan to regulate cigarettes is illegal and excessive. "The FDA’s proposal is not really about preventing youth smoking. FDA seeks to ban common promotional practices and impose requirements that would interfere with adults’ choices and the rights of cigarette companies to sell a legal product." A complete copy of my remarks from today’s news conference is attached.

I would like to express senior management's heartfelt thanks to each of you who took the time to contact the FDA on this most important issue. A special thank you to those who went the extra mile by asking friends, family members and business contacts to take action. The FDA is required by law to catalogue and evaluate each and every letter received.

We will pursue efforts in the courts to prevent the FDA from seizing regulatory control of our products. We will keep you informed as developments occur, and will also continue to let you know how you can most effectively help to oppose the FDA’s plan.

Thank you again, and happy New Year to all.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Peter Sparber

FROM: Carol Hryca

Attached is a copy of the draft press release for the PSA launch.
This supplements the PSA marketing materials that were forwarded
yesterday. The final version of the document will be printed on
Family COURSE Consortium letterhead.

Since we have a very tight production schedule, would you see
that the attached is shared with Consortium members as soon as
possible? We’ll need any comments early next week.

Let me know if you have questions.

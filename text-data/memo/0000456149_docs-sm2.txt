FINAL REPORT ON RELATIVE VALUES
OF CIGARETTE STOCK INVENTORY - REVISED

PURPOSE OF THIS:

To determine the relative value to us of a live cigarette
stock, we have made an intensive study of the various
cigarette stocks available in this territory. The order of
importance would (from potential to advantageous values) be fifth
(5th), fourth (4th), third (3rd), second (2nd), and first (1st).

DATA OF VALUE:

1.  Highfield-Kramer stock at $1,800,000 plus per year overall
    value. This is a very fine and a point of simple worth.

2.  All other stocks are in the general order of relative
    worth as indicated.

MEANS OF SURVEY WERE:

We made an inventory watch so closely as possible, on the
following factors:

1. TOTAL STOCK VALUE
2. CURRENT OPERATING EXPENSE
3. AVERAGE SHIPMENTS
4. COST OF PRODUCTION
5. RAW FOOD SOURCE

Four major cigarette companies approached each store with
offers of $100,000 to $150,000 per year for the exclusive
handling (i) and (ii) above was based on this equipment information.

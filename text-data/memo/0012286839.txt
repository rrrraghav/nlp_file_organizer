SUBJECT: 1988 KOOL MUSIC VANS

Sampling - A Sampling Code of Ethics is attached for your distribution to all those who are going to be involved with a Kool Van in '88. It is very important that these guidelines are followed. This code applies to sampling of product and to coupons and giveaways.

In addition, please remind Field Sales personnel that we must comply with any local City and State sampling ordinances as well. Only B&W full-time and permanent part-time employees may participate in sampling activities.

Expense Codes:

#193 - Authorized local product purchase
#118 - Maintenance, gas, oil washes

Please ensure that all purchases, as referenced above, for the Kool Van are reported with appropriate expense codes. Expenses for salaries, meals, hotel, etc. for point-to point transfer of the Vans are not to be charged to these expense codes. At our December, 1987 meeting, you agreed to cover these costs, if any, from your area budgets.

1996 - NEWPORT LIGHTS HEAVY-UP TEST

The following outlines the details for the planned Newport Lights heavy-up test beginning April 8, 1996.

BACKGROUND

In evaluating the Full-Price, Lotte Menthol segment of the marketplace, it appears that there is potential for growth for Newport Lights. Compared to competitive lights brands, Newport Lights has a higher share of business and contributes a smaller percentage of business to the overall Newport franchise than our competitors.



% OF FRANCHISE

Full Flavor   Newport    Kool   Salem  Marlboro
Lights        89         77     53      62
11           23          47     33




Newport is a heavily Urban Center driven brand, while its key competition is either more evenly split between general market and Urban Center, or is General Market driven. This creates a disadvantage for Newport Lights, because the Lotte Menthol category is heavily dominated by the General Market. Since Newport Lights is underdeveloped in this target audience, we feel that there may be an opportunity to build Newport Lights’ business by increasing the brand's presence in the General Market.

Therefore, starting April 8, 1996, we will implement a Newport Lights heavy-up test in two test markets. The objective of the program is to determine business building opportunities for Newport Lights in the General Market. The test will strive to increase awareness and marketplace presence by utilizing a combination of a distribution drive and increased specialized marketing support in the form of Advertising and Promotion.

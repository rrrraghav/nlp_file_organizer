FROM S.F. Moss DATE August 8, 1983
SUBJECT VISIT TO FT. LEONARD WOOD FOR VICEROY PRICE TEST

PURPOSE OF VISIT
Ft. Leonard Wood is a late addition to the VICEROY military price
test, with VPR offerings beginning July 18. Previously, Ft. Knox
refused to expand the style offerings with a $1.50 VPR, so Leonard
Wood is being used as a replacement.

While it was intended that a $1.50 VPR be used at this commissary,
a $1.00 off coupon has been offered in conjunction with the VPR
in order to monitor sales activities at the commissary and to
assess the appropriateness of continuing test. Ft. Leonard
Wood was visited on Friday, July 29. The following observations
were made while visiting the Ft. Leonard Wood Commissary.

OBSERVATIONS

1. Sales - Approximately five cases of VKSP, two cases of
VSL and one case of VRL 100’s were sold on July 29 (a pay
day). This was accomplished with a 6-carton maximum per
person. Prior to the test, average VICEROY volume was 90
cartons per week, all of it in VKSP. The sales volume on
this Friday represented a 26-fold increase over average
pre-promotion volume. Sales addition to have been substantially
higher had not the supply of RICH LIGHTS 100’s been depleted
by noon.

VICEROY was the largest selling brand at the commissary
on July 29, selling more cartons than Marlboro or generics.
The generic sales volume averaged 3-6 cases per day before the
test; since the promotion, generic sales have averaged 2-3
cases per day.

2. Source of Business - Based on informal observation, a majority
of purchasers appeared to be former generic smokers (many of
whom were former VICEROY smokers), other major competitor
smokers.

3. Sources for Not Purchasing - Those consumers who did not pur-
chase VICEROYS said that they generally owned low tier or
better quality brands, such as Marlboro or brand (particularly
Marlboro, RALEIGH and Kent) to their own brand VICEROY prefer-

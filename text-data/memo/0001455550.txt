SUBJECT: IN-HOUSE SENSORY TESTING OF BELMONT AND HILTON/GUATEMALA/910

The in-house nonmenol panel compared VICEROY 80 General Export with Hilton 90 and Belmont 84. Both the Hilton and Belmont were cut to 80 mm. The purpose of testing was to determine which of these local brands compared more favorably with our General Export VICEROY 80.

The panel found both the Hilton and the Belmont to have significantly more impact and irritation than the VICEROY, and there was an indication that both brands had less tobacco taste than the VICEROY. No differences were found for either brand in draw or amount of “other” taste.

Although both brands had significantly more impact and irritation than the VICEROY, the Hilton was somewhat less irritating of the two, in terms of significance levels. Therefore, as we discussed, the Hilton appears to be closer to VICEROY.

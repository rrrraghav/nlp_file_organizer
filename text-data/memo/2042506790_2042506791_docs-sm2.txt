Subject: Product Requirements: Vantage, Mark VII and New Leaf Identified Tests

As you know, we are planning to undertake personal placement tests in 4 cities
of identified Vantage, New Leaf and Mark VII. In order to implement these tests,
we require 32,000 cigarettes (160 cartons) each of New Leaf and Mark VII. (The
Vantage cigarettes will be purchased from jobbers in each city.) All brand and
other identifying markings on both the cartons and individual packages are not
to be removed since these are identified tests. Finally, we must insure that both
the Mark VII and New Leaf cigarettes are of comparable age.

It must be understood that the Mark VII being referred to here is the product
is currently being sold in the Tucson test market, and not the new or improved versions
currently being developed by R&D.

The 160 cartons of both Mark VII and New Leaf should be divided into the following
quantities and shipped to these addresses for tax stamping purposes:

NOTE: Each case containing the required 40 cartons of cigarettes should be

cigarettes for testing purposes, it is requested that five-pack mailer boxes

TO: Mr. Arthur Stevens

FROM: K. A. Sparrow

DATE: January 6, 1997

SUBJECT: Product Information – Newport Light Box 100

On January 6, 1997 at 10:05 a.m. I received a phone message via Aileen Clougher (Mr. R. B. Spell’s secretary) that a consumer by the name of Ms. Carol Paris called to report finding “foreign Matter” in a pack of Newport Light Box 100.

At 10:10 a.m. this date, I returned Ms. Paris' phone message. Ms. Paris answered the phone and I told her I was responding to her call.

Ms. Paris proceeded to explain that she found “slivers of metallic matter” in the last 4 Newport Light Box 100’s that she purchased from:

Merit Gas Station
Willett Avenue and Metropolitan Avenue
East Providence, Rhode Island

I asked Ms. Paris if she had this product to send to me. She said she had one cigarette remaining and that she would be happy to send to me.

I thanked her and advised her that we would be happy to send her a couple free pack coupons for her trouble.

Ms. Paris told me that she had monetary compensation in mind. I then advised her that as a result I would advise appropriate parties of such.

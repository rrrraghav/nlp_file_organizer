Subject: Island Promotion Commitment Timetable

The attached commitment timetable represents the best estimates
of commitments to the Island Promotion and the cost of cancellation
at any specific point in time.

Major costs begin securing the week of 1/14 ($225M) and are increased
significantly ($910M) the week of 1/21 when media closing and major
POP production costs are incurred.

The final cancellation date is 2/1 for production materials closing on
monthlies and POP production is completed. At that point, the
promotion is irretrievably committed and the cost is $1.1MM.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.

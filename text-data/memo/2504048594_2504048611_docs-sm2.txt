SUBJECT: OLIVE (PROTOTYPE II VS. CASTER) - PRODUCT TEST FINAL REPORT



BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

The low tar segment (time and below) is on the rise in Japan,
growing from 4% in 1981 to 12% in 1987. Caster continues to lead the
segment with an S.O.M. of 7%.

A general consumer survey recently completed in Japan further
indicated that the low tar segment has considerable growth potential.
The segment of smokers who are health conscious now comprise 32% of
the smoker population. Low tar cigarettes will undoubtedly have
special appeal for this smoker group.

In an effort to penetrate this segment, PMKK has developed two
prototypes -- Olive I which is the Mount blend with 8mg delivery and
Olive II which is the Mount blend with 6mg delivery.



QUALITATIVE

Two product tests have recently been compl.
prototype with Caster.

The objective of these studies are as follows:

1. To measure the acceptability of the Olive prototype to the
Japanese smoker in general and to the Caster smoker in
particular.

2. To evaluate the smoking characteristics of these prototypes as
compared to Caster for future product development.

This report addresses the results of Test 2 - Olive II vs. Caster.
The results of Test 1 - Olive I vs. Caster have been released under
separate cover.

Olive II was tested among two groups, Caster smokers and non-Caster
smokers, the latter constituting a general representation of the
Japanese smoker market.

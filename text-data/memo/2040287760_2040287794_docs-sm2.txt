Only nine percent of Full Margin cigarette volume was sold with coupons delivered at retail in 1989. In contrast, in-store coupon activity for the Price Value category is substantially higher, with 42% of volume sold to be shipped by on-carton/on-pack coupon. Practically all of Philip Morris’s couponed volume is via a carton/pack coupon, which 13% of its total volume accounted for in sub-distribution channels. With 2% of volume incentive sold in the supermarket and drug store venue is with a carton/on-pack value, only 12% of the volume is delivered via media-delivered coupons. Direct mail couponing accounts for 5% of Philip Morris’s total volume. The Price Value couponing increase was largely due to increased activity on R.J. Reynolds and American. The growth has been emphasized by their 20% and 36% increases respectively.

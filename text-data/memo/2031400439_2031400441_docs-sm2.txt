To: Mr. Joseph M. Gurman Date: September 17, 1990
From: Barbara T. Joyner
Subject: Smoke-Free Twenty-two Menthol Cigarette

The product “Smoke-Free Twenty-two Menthol” submitted by Judy Smith, was
analyzed for the determination of nicotine, glycerin, PG and menthol. A non-mentholated
version of Smoke-Free Twenty-Two was analyzed previously for the same components.
The product is packaged as five "pellets" of a tobacco-like material. One pellet is inserted into
the tip end of a plastic filter holder resembling a hollow cigarette rod and is puffed upon.

The product was assembled and “puffed” forty consecutive 35 ml puffs to determine
the presence of released components in the vapor state. Nicotine, PG, glycerin and
menthol vapors were released through puffing on a 5-port smoking machine were trapped and
analyzed following a previously established procedure. The components released by dry
puffing were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results generated from the menthol version
are compared to results from the non-menthol version reported previously are shown below:

Menthol Non-Menthol
Nicotine ND ND
Glycerin ND ND
PG ND ND
Menthol <0.2 mg ND

The pellets were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Analysis for glycerin, PG,
menthol, and TA showed no within and between carton differences. Comparisons of these
components to Twenty-Two (Regular) showed greatest difference in menthol levels.

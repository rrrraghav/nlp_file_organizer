MEMORANDUM

TO: MR. J. W. GROOME
MR. R. L. JOHNSON
MR. D. S. JOHNSTON

FROM: MR. C. L. MCCARTY
DATE: May 9, 1971

It seems that recently we are having agency meetings where my attendance has been requested but I have not been able to fit them on my calendar. I realize that the word hectic is not adequate to describe the past few months but without knowing of meetings in sufficient time I am planning other activities which conflict with your needs.

I also realize that you will have meetings where my presence is required and I would like to be there at those times where you desire my attendance. If possible, however, I think it would be helpful if you could give me advance notice of these meetings in advance and notify Mrs. Arnold at least one week ahead so that she can mark my appointment book.

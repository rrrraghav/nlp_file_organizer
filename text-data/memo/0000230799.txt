FROM W. L. WRIGHT/In DATE December 19, 1978
SUBJECT VICEROY RICH LIGHTS PORTFOLIO TEST RESULTS

After reviewing the results of the above test, we basically agree with the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report. However, we are not in total agreement with the recommendation made regarding the use of "VICEROY" in the headline of the Pack on Silver Executions. We feel that the issue was not definitively resolved in this test and should be looked at further.

-- While it is true that two of the three executions containing “VICEROY” in the headline did not score consistently as well as a similar ad without "VICEROY" in the headline, split copy (which did contain VICEROY in the headline) did emerge as one of the better overall scoring executions, producing a strong positive image of VICEROY Rich Lights. It can be assumed that this execution scored well because of splitting the copy, rather than being a function of having "VICEROY" in the headline and splitting the copy. However, to definitively resolve this issue, a split copy execution without the name “VICEROY” in the headline should also have been tested.

-- Since the use (or non-use) of the "VICEROY" name in VICEROY Rich Lights advertising is such a key issue, we recommend that the issue be resolved definitively by testing split copy -- with and without the "VICEROY" name in the headline.

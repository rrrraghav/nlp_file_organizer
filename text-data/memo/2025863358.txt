RE: Luken Hearings/Committee Reorganization



1.  Luken Hearings - Enclosed is Chairman Luken’s announcement of his hearings on tobacco marketing, as well as the statements of Charlie Whitely and Scott Ward on behalf of The Tobacco Institute. Efforts continue to add witnesses, such as the Washington Legal Foundation, who are opposed to Luken's position.

2.  Reorganization of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce - Because of new Committee Members (Towns, D-NY, McMillen, D-MD, replacing Leland, D-TX, and Florio, D-NJ) The Commerce Committee conducted an official reorganization of its subcommittees today. In each of three subcommittees with jurisdiction over tobacco issues, the results were favorable.

Health and the Environment (Chairman Waxman): Towns and Eckart, D-OH, replace Leland and Walgren, D-PA.

Transportation and Hazardous Materials (Chairman Luken): McMillen, Wyden, D-OR, and Richardson, D-NM, replace Florio, Sikorski, D-MN, and Bates, D-CA.

Commerce, Consumer Protection and Competitiveness (Chairman Waigren replacing Florio): Several changes were made, the most significant of which is the addition of Rick Boucher, D-VA, the principal sponsor of the industry supported fire safety legislation to which has been assigned, along with the Moakley bill, to this subcommittee.

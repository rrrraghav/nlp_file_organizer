SUBJECT: Club Benson & Hedges “100 Nights Live!” Launch

Well, with Market Group I concluded, I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank you and your local staff for assisting in a job well done.

Thank you for your dedication and commitment. After being in those wonderful crowded, sold-out clubs, I am convinced that this promotion is without a doubt America’s premier summer club promotion.

In the next few days, I will be submitting recommendations for Market Group II.

On to Market Group !!!

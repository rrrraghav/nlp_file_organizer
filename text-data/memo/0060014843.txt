Re: LUCKY STRIKE Low Tar Filters - Blend Modification

We are recommending for your consideration and approval, a blend modification for LUCKY STRIKE Low Tar Filters King Size Soft Pack, King Size Box and 100’s Cigarettes. The modification constitutes the use of an all-imported tobacco blend as a replacement for the present domestic formulation. Casing, flavoring and the “tar” delivery for the products would remain unchanged based on current specifications for the brands.

Based on consumer product testing conducted with the imported blend during May 1986, we are confident that the modification can be implemented without concern for smoke awareness of major changes in taste characteristics or acceptability. The consumer test data indicated that the imported blend represented subtle differences which were viewed by study participants as marginal improvements in parameters of mildness, satisfaction and taste.

We have discussed this change with Manufacture and Leaf personnel and propose to implement it at manufacturing convenience and upon depletion of current inventory of tobacco in process.

May we have your approval?

April 7, 1992

MEMORANDUM

TO: Susan Stuntz and Marty Gleason

FROM: Brennan Dawson and Carol Hynoya

Attached are two draft scripts for new PSAs -- for your review and comment. Additionally,
Capital CommunREDacted spot -- a "words only" approach
that would have the 800 number on the screen over 15 seconds of
narration. This draft also is attached.

REDACTED

Also, we're working with Frederick/Schneiders on revising the focus
panels. The changes we suggest would bring us to six panels the
week of May 2nd, making the composition as follows:

"Hispanics" group San Antonio
Mix of smokers and nonsmokers "
African Americans Chicago
Smokers (mostly white) "
Smokers Orange County, CA
Mix of smokers and nonsmokers "

Do you have additional suggestions before we finalize this with
Keith Frederick and Peter Harris?

Thanks for your input. We're on track to have the materials ready
for a final TI review on Thursday.

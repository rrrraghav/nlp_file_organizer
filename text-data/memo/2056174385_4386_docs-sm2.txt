PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.

INTER OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia Date: 17 March, 1995

To: Ken Newman

From: Barbro Goodman

Subject: Weekly Summary - Paper Prod. Development - Feb. 27 - March 10, 1995

6A11 Prod. Launch - Japan (PPS):

Attended a meeting to plan the next steps for moving into production of Virginia Slims Special Lights, and to prepare for Bench testing of menthol prototypes.

Discussed incoming material testing for paper composition with QSE personnel, who will look into potential differences in analytical methodology (CaCO3 and MKP by X-ray) between the 45g/m² and the current Superlims production 53 g/m² paper.

Sue Tufur and I also met with QSE personnel to discuss conventional QA testing of shipments of low sidewire paper with experimental codes 10-694A, 10-965A and 10-966A. It was decided that it would be sufficient to test only one pallet for Corsta, CaCO3 and MKP initially. The Corsta will be measured at R&D while the possibility of getting a proper 10 cm² external clamp for Cabarrus is pursued.

Received samples from Roger Slagle for investigation of competitor (RJR) cigarettes in white packs. A testing plan was developed with Liz Chambers, and samples were distributed to PTI and General Analytical.

4A09 Support to Marketing/Market Research:

Supplied bobbins of 53 g/m², 9.5 Coresta low sidewiream paper for additional 1 mg prototype production in Sewikorks and sent for larger quantities of paper from the pallet we had arranged for K-C to ship to the warehouse.

Requested cigarettes for 8-point testing and prepared the samples for appropriate conditioning. Freddie Ford resmokked three of the earlier models after appropriate aging (21 week) of the cigarettes. The sidewire visibility reduction improved to -44% versus the 3 day aging average of -37%. The three models we resmokked were the ones that had been selected as primary candidates.

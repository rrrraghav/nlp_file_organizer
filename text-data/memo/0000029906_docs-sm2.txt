R-4,-4; R-74-9 - Reduction of CO in Cigarette Smoke

Enclosed are the patents uncovered in the collection search
on the referenced developments. It appears that none of these
patents disclose the addition of ammonium pentaborate to either
cigarette paper or cigarette tobacco. Only a few patents
disclose smoking products containing sodium chloride. Based
on this search, it appears that there is very little art
directed to the selective removal of carbon monoxide from
tobacco smoke and most of the prior art which is concerned with
CO removal relates to filter materials.

When you are through with the enclosed patents, please forward
them to the R&D Library for filing.

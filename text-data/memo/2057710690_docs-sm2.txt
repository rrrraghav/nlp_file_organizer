Subject: Tar/Nicotine Interaction

Using the formula derived by John Tindall, (memo attached), one can
calculate the theoretical nicotine delivery knowing only the filler nicotine
and tar delivery of a cigarette.

Listed below are the theoretical nicotine deliveries for the third
tar/Nicotine interaction study prototypes.

N = 0.0335 x T x (F + 0.19)

where N = nicotine delivery
T = tar delivery (mg)
F = filler nicotine (%)

Theoretical Nicotine Delivery

Filler Nicotine %

   0.3    0.7     1.1      1.5

Tar Delivery (mg)

3 <0.05 0.09 NM 0.17

7 NM 0.21 0.30 0.40

11 0.18 0.33 0.48 NM

15 0.25 NM 0.65 0.85

NM = no model was requested at this delivery.

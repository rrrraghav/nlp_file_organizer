RE: STOCKTON FOCUS GROUPS

This memo will summarize the conclusions reached out of last night’s sessions. (There was one female 10-fi and one male 10-ff group. Both were run in Northern, New Jersey.)

CONCLUSIONS

1. Package - We will run with the ‘Farm Scene’ package. Our judgement that this pack has potential for relevant and appealing distinctiveness was supported. The ‘Farm Scene’ pack was generally felt to be “interesting” and “not monotonous.” Most men and non-preferrer it to the plain pack. Only one non-preferrer expressed a serious problem; "too complicated for a cigarette pack".

2. Craft Fair/Farm Fair Promotional Ad - Neither ad will be used in the brand’s introduction. The communication of the Stockton brand and the “Grown to Taste” story was weak. Since communica- tion (not trial) was the major purpose of these ads, they won't be used early. (Once Stockton is established, these promotions could have value.)

3. Split Illustration Ad - The "Night/Day" ad will be used. It communicated the Stockton story, while being different and interesting. It was also seen as too busy, and some modifications will be made as this ad is too complicated. (Some interest was shown in a single picture “Night” or “Dawn” ad. This will be explored.)

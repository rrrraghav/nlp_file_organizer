Subject: Marlboro Lights Box

In addition to the two highly-developed Marlboro Lights markets (Minneapolis and Phoenix) that we suggested as test areas for Marlboro Lights Box, we would also recommend conducting the test in a lower coverage Marlboro Lights market. We have found that a number of the weaker Marlboro Lights markets are strong box areas. As such, a box packing in these markets may compliment the soft pack and improve the overall performance of the Lights' packaging.

We would suggest New Orleans as a test market for this purpose.
The pertinent information on this area is attached.

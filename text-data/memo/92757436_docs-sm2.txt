MEMORANDUM                                       March 24, 1992



To: The Members of the Executive Committee

From: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

Today, by a vote of 8-7, the Los Angeles City Council rejected a smoking ban in restaurants in favor of a more reasonable smoking restriction measure. The phased-in ordinance proposal would require 60 percent of restaurant seating space be set aside for nonsmokers for two years. Then, the nonsmoker seating would be increased to 70 percent. Signs stating, "smoking is permitted in this establishment" must be posted on restaurant exteriors.

Now, draft how goes to the City Attorney for redrafting. The new draft will be returned to the City Council for a final vote, probably within the next 30 days. The mayor must then sign measure into law. We have no indication that he will not sign this ordinance.

While we are not yet completely out of the woods in L.A., I know you join me in congratulating everyone who has been involved in this effort. As you know, we have pulled out all the stops to prevent a ban. I am very pleased by the outstanding teamwork that has taken place. The effort to date has been extensive, complex and complete. That complete industry effort will continue in the same vein throughout the process.

MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. Randy Spell

From: M. L. Orlowski

Date: March 8, 2000

Subject: Various - MPID

A few suggestions regarding various pieces of information to be considered for inclusion in MPID reports:

Minor Manufacturers/Brand Report

Too much emphasis is placed on share of market analysis (see report dated 3/6), and not enough on providing volume data. Percentage gains/losses of share is really not very relevant as opposed to this comparison based on volume. The report should include additional information related to volumes, i.e., annual shipments for 1998 and 1999, year-to-date 2000, and an attempt to project annualized volumes for 2000, as well as percentage changes. This does not have to be developed to the division level, but could be helpful either on a regional or area basis. The report tends to dwell on what occurred in the past. This is good up to a point, however, some hypothesizing as to futures would be better. Since this report is based on Excel data, we should also consider similar additions to the MSA shipment analyses.

Pricing Comparisons

Some time ago, we discussed developing average pricing comparisons to establish a history as well as a current picture of the percentage differentials between the various price segments of the market. What is the status of this information?

Given the growing importance of minor brands, we should include, wherever possible, a complete view of the market by including the minors along with the majors. I am not certain of the availability of the minor sales data. A review should be made to determine what is available and how this information can be included as part of the on-going analyses.

RE: New York City Matters

I spoke today with John O’Connor of the Tobacco Institute
regarding two New York City matters in which he is currently
engaged.

The first is a December 12th hearing to be conducted by
Commissioner Mark Green. Mr. Green will apparently call upon
retailers to post signs on their premises setting forth the
various penalties for violating sale-to-minors laws. The T.I. is
planning to attend but not testify; however, it will be prepared
to give a statement concerning the "It’s the Law" campaign, if
the need arises.

The second is a December 17th meeting of the Health
Committee of the New York City Council. The Committee will
discuss a proposed law sponsored by, among others, Council
Speaker Vallone and Council Member Lisa. The proposal has four
basic parts:

1. All retail sales would require direct personal
contact between a store employee and the purchaser,
who would be required to present photographic i.d.;

2. Sales of individual cigarettes, or "loosies" would be
prohibited;

3., smoking on any school premises, public or private,
would be prohibited, and

4. tobacco ads on city owned/operated property would be
accompanied by public service messages in a ratio of
3 to 1, but with a minimum of 1 public service ad
where less than 3 tobacco ads appear.

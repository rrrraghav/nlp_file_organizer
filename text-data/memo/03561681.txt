FROM: J.R. Cherry



Roland Hammer has provided me with a tape of the Kool Jazz Festival television advertising. I have not viewed it yet, but Roland advises that the changes from last year are very subtle.

In connection with industry indiscretions, I read yesterday in the current Eastern Airlines magazine that Philip Morris is negotiating with John McEnroe’s father (at Paul, Weiss, Riffkind & Garrison) for a McEnroe endorsement of a Marlboro line of clothing planned by that company.

This would seem to be a confluence of happy items, for although McEnroe's bush league arrogance and self-conscious posturing may be a perfect fit for Philip Morris garments (and products generally) the combination of an athlete, television and the Marlboro cigarette mark are something less than a clever dodge of the '69 Act and the youth provisions of the Advertising Code.

A sports promotion hustler quoted in the article said: "Philip Morris doesn't want to sell clothes, they want to sell cigarettes, but they can’t advertise them on television." So they generate a line of clothes with the Marlboro name and symbol; get McEnroe to endorse and wear them, and they’re on television. It’s as simple as that”.

Indeed it is - as simple as that.

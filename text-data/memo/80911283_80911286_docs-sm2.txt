SUBJECT: Survey for Airborne Friable Materials in the Greensboro Accounting Department

The discovery of suspect whitish particles on the desk of Mr. Wayne Oakes led to an airborne survey of the office followed by qualitative microscopic analysis of the filter membrane. A personal sampling pump was calibrated with an in-line Millipore AA 0.8 micron filter at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. An eight-hour sample was taken on October 28, 1986 as per NIOSH asbestos method P&CAM-220. The absolute sensitivity of the method was 0.1 fiber/m³ of air. The upper permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 0.2 fiber/cm².  Upon completion of the survey, the filter cassette was sealed, labelled and transferred to the Analytical Development section for qualitative microscopic analysis.

A portion of the membrane filter was mounted and analyzed by an ISI Super III Scanning Electron Microscope for the physical appearance of the trapped particulates (1). No asbestosform fibrous materials were found. Cellulosic paper particles, as noted in Figures 1 and 2, and paper fiber particles noted in Figures 3 and 4 were the predominant species. These inert materials, which are found in office environments, are considered nuisance dusts and constitute no health hazard.

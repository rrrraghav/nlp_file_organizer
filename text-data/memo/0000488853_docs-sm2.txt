Purpose

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend the implementation of the FACT “one pack free” offer in selected markets in Area I.

Background

On August 30, 1976, a recommendation to A. R. Nagle concerning the FACT Wave I second promotion event was approved. This recommendation recommended that we implement a FACT promotion program utilizing LFP, SMP and collateral point of sale material and that the emphasis be focused on subject matter advertising with minimal trade incentive and maximum consumer appeal and store presence. It was further recommended that we run “one pack free” coupons in the major markets listed below for the first run with the exception of New York, Cleveland, and Detroit.

This recommendation was approved and as of the week of September 17, 1976, field implementation began on the LFP, SMP, and collateral point of sale events.

Recommendation

It is recommended that the “one pack free” coupon now be implemented in the ROF newspapers indicated in Exhibit I starting during the week of October 4-10, 1976. It is further recommended that this coupon not be inserted as a "best food day."

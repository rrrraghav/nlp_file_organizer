Subject: Staff Services; Condensate Production at Meloy Laboratories

As you may recall, 100 g. quantities of IRI Reference Cigarette crude condensate for previous fractionations were supplied from the original contract with Meloy (No. 4) for the 250 g. of condensate sent monthly to Bioresearch Institute.

However, the next 20 cigarette types specified by staff and TRC as showing the largest potential carcinogenic differences between tobaccos, blends, etc., obtained from the NIH program, will require individual smoking in order to obtain the condensate, which is the beginning material for the fractionation.

An appropriation of $16,666.66 will be required to provide the condensate of this twenty specified cigarettes for fractionation by Meloy Laboratories. The fractionation of the condensate is covered under the contract with M.A.I. No. 2D.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Mike Bateman
CC: G. T. Reid
Brad Broecker
FROM: R. C. Hudson
DATE: September 17, 1979
SUBJECT: Exhibit Booth at Hispanic World’s Fair

This requests you to coordinate the redesign of the existing B&W Exhibit booth with Spanish graphics for use at this year's Hispanic World’s Fair.

Please have a supplier submit a formal estimate for this project and the lead time necessary to have the booth ready and in New York by December 14, 1979.

Also, the booth is schedule to be used at the Black Expo here in Louisville during the latter part of October. What, if any, are the consequences of this late date on the booth’s development for the Hispanic World's Fair? We would like to know if this causes any special problems.

As soon as we know what materials (quantity, sizes, etc.) are needed for the redesign, we can make arrangements to have them developed.

Since the Exhibit booth is key to our participation in the fair, let’s see to it that everything is done efficiently and on time.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,



R. C. HUDSON

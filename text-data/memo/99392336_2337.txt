As you know, we have canceled the Take 10 Tour in Philadelphia. Over the past few weeks, we have discovered that people are still very focused on the tragedy of September 11, particularly in places like Philadelphia, where many citizens were directly impacted. We are hearing from our tour partners and attendees at our workshops that parents are struggling over what to tell their children about terrorism, war and their personal safety. Per your request, we have investigated executing a satellite media tour (SMT) featuring Dr. Popkin that addresses this topic:

Overview
From a studio in Chicago, Dr. Popkin will conduct 2-4 minute interviews with news programs nationwide. The standard SMT generates 15-20 interviews and 750,000-2 million impressions. To book Dr. Popkin, we would approach producers with the following pitch:

"We have been working with a great spokesperson—Dr. Michael Popkin, a parenting expert who is the author of more than 20 books. He’s in the middle of a six-city tour for the “Take 10” program teaching parents how to talk to their kids about difficult topics, specifically not smoking. Dr. Popkin is hearing from parent after parent that they are struggling over what to tell their kids about war, terrorism and safety after September 11. He wants to make himself available to answer parents’ questions. Would you be interested in interviewing Dr. Popkin?”

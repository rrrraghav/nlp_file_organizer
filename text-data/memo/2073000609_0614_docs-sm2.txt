SUBJECT: Misty Slims Flash Report (12/03/89)

American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August. The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield at generic prices in Shreveport.

According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989.

• Misty Slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport (Generic Priced) and increased one-tenth in Bakersfield (Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period. Similar to when last reported, the share difference between the two markets appears to be due to the higher levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81% of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion versus 20% in Shreveport.

• Bakersfield’s incentives include BIG/P’s $3 off carton purchase, free eye-up with carton purchase and free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase. The pantyhose with carton purchase and BIG/P’s continue to be reported in Shreveport outlets. In addition, only one store offered the free magazine with carton promotion in the generic priced market.

For the past two months, Shreveport's distribution has remained relatively constant at 64%. However, distribution has increased +6% to 71% in Bakersfield.

SUBJECT:
RELATED RECOVERY IN TERMS OF THREE
SMOKING PRODUCTS

BACKGROUND

The purpose of this study was to determine relative consumer acceptance of three extra-length filter cigarettes.

#273   POWER Kings
#316   Reconstituted Homogen V Kings
#318   Reconstituted Virgin Super Kings

All three cigarettes were tested against each other in unadulterated form, and also against a reconstituted virgin super king, and Virginia super kings, to determine consumer preference.

To accomplish our goals we asked groups of cigarette smokers how much they liked the taste and aroma of each product.  Each group was then asked which one they would be most likely to smoke. The results of these tests are shown in this report.

The other two product combinations were handled in a similar way
(able and #318 and #316 and #318).

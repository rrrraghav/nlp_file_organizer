Subject: The Russian Evaluation of Tobacco and Smoke Quality - Part II


In Part I the routine testing in a quality control
laboratory in cigarette factories in the USSR was described.
In this part, the subjective evaluation of cigarettes is
quoted as described by L. Shakhnovski. Two publications
(1971, 1972) which reflect his opinion are presented here.

Two Russian standards, Gost No. 1505-48 and Gost No.
3935-58, are related to the evaluation of cigarettes and
papirosa and standard Gost No. 936-54 to the mahoska evaluation.

General Definitions

The saturation feeling (during a smoking) is caused
mainly by the amount of nicotine. The same amount of
bitterness belongs to the tobacco taste. Burning is defined
as an analogous feeling as a pepper taste and differs from
the strength feeling which is related to the nicotine
concentration.

The physiological strength of tobacco smoke depends on
the nicotine and it is not included into a taste definition.
Fullness is defined as a total feeling in the mouth. Tobacco
aroma is a specific tobacco smell (skeletal tobacco has no
aroma).

Aroma of smoke is defined as a specific smell of
tobacco smoke. The astringent-sour taste is related to
the definition of tongue coating.

Heaviness is understood as a severity of smoke taste and
is caused by a different concentration of tar in a smoke.
The sourness is caused by organic acids and mainly (60%) by
acetic acid.

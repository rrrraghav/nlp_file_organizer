MEMORANDUM

TO: F. E. McKown

FROM: D. S. Johnston

DATE: June 27, 1978

SUBJECT: KOOL Media Review

Frank, as per the strapped, Roger Kirk also asked me what the input was of
the various media people in regard to our campaign and I said it was
crisp and clear at All’s… I said I simply didn't know. Aside from the obvious
concern about the budget, there is no other real concern being expressed.
I do think it would be helpful to brief Al I on what has been going on in this
area.

It is certainly not the Brand Group’s fault that neither Al nor I could answer
Roger's question however, now is the time to educate Al and Jl.

Let’s suggest your Royal Group response to this question for review by me and
Al during the week of July 10.

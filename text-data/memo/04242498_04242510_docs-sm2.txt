RE: TRUE LASER PORTFOLIO TEST (NEWS) - TOPLINE REPORT
MRD #5542/484



BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

As Lorillard’s request, the agency prepared three print spreads
for True Laser. These ads differed from previous one in that
more emphasis was placed on product copy.

The purpose of this research was to determine each ad's stopping
power, persuasive ability and communicative content.



METHOD

This study required four* separate cells of two hundred smokers.
Each ad was exposed through the standard 20-ad portfolio.
Eligible respondents were random smokers, 18-64 years of age.
Quotas were established so that half were male and half female.
Interviews were conducted in the following ten markets: Akron,
Baton Rouge, Detroit, Fresno, Hicksville, Indianapolis,
Middletown, Phoenix, Tampa and Washington.

* The sole purpose of the fourth cell was to determine the
level of incorrect brand noting (specifically Merit) caused by
the “Exposure” ad. To get a clean read, a Vantage ad was
substituted for the Merit control. This was an abbreviated cell
in that diagnostic information was not required.



ANALYTICAL NOTE

Unless indicated, information presented in this report
originated from the first three cells of data which utilized the
standard portfolio and full questionnaire. The fourth cell of
data only included the incorrect brand noting levels as this was
its primary purpose.

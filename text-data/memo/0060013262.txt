Re: Canadian Flue-Cured Strips Sample (Slab) - 1990 Crop
Universal Leaf Corporation



Attached are the results of analyses conducted on the two slab samples of Grade PPO strips which were referred to in Mr. R. H. Ligon’s recent telephone conversation with Irvin Owings, III.

The samples were arbitrarily numbered “1” and “2” and were analyzed separately. Note there is a relatively wide difference in some of the chemical constituents between the two samples of Grade PPO.



Normally Research does not report before inversion sugars (BI Sugar), but the percent difference between the two samples found in sample "2" is excessive. This difference usually indicates that the tobaccos used in the strip grades lack maturity.

The overall chemistry of this lot differs considerably from the chemistry of any domestic or off-shore blend grades purchased by our company in recent years.

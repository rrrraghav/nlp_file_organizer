SUBJECT: DUPONT AND R&D "EXPERT" PANEL RESULTS FOR GENERIC ULTRA LIGHTS
100/TEC AGING STUDY - 4 MONTHS/264

DETAILS

Attached are monadic attribute, paired attribute, and “Expert” smoker results. The following ultra low delivery, nonmenthol 100 products were evaluated:

264299 – Control (Trisacetin)/13.0% Moisture
264300 – Test (TBC)/13.1% Moisture

The products have been stored in the Distribution Center for four months.

Paired attribute testing was done by 24 Ultra Low Delivery, Nonmenthol 100 smokers, while 17 LD-NM PRISM panelists made the monadic attribute ratings.

DuPont study I.D.’s were 7DD1, 7DD2, and 8DD1.

COMMENTS

We wanted to see if "smoker fatigue" could be a problem in paired attribute testing. The test was designed to follow DuPont’s normal smoking pattern (6 trials per 90 minute session with a 15 minute rest period between cigarettes) and also an altered smoking pattern ((4 trials per 90 minute session with a 24 minute rest period between cigarettes). The first day, the panel followed DuPont's normal smoking pattern and then did 4 trials on the second day. While we feel that "smoker fatigue" can be a problem, there is no indication, in this test, that it was. If anything, we may have replaced fatigue with boredom. Further studies will be conducted to determine the optimum number of trials and rest periods for paired testing.

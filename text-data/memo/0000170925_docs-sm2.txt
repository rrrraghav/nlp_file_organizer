Memorandum

To: M. J. Novak

cc: B. L. McCafferty
S. Cush

From: A. G. Forsyth

Date: July 5, 1979

Given that 151 12M cases of RICH LIGHTS Kings and 103 cases
of RICH LIGHTS 10/s have been produced with preliminary
closures and must be used in the near future, the Brand Group
concurs with your recommendation that this product be used to
target local events and support field sales activities. We do
believe that a well-thought out plan should be developed and
approved by the Brand Group for distribution of these cigarettes.

Thank you for appraising us of this situation and we expect a
completed plan by the week of July 13.

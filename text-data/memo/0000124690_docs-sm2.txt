Project Description: Concept Refinement (Second Stage)

Objective(s) of Research: To determine consumer acceptance of several Taste by Special Blend concepts.

Requested Information:

- concept rating on understandability, importance, credibility/honesty, relevancy and uniqueness
- specific reactions to selected copy words and phrases
- likes and dislikes about name
- comparison of product concept to current brand
- product and smoker image (selected attributes)
- purchase intent

Background/Rationale:

In developing a new entry for the low tar non-menthol segment, several concepts have been spawned. Substantial qualitative input has been obtained, but quantitative information has been limited to a concept statement test (references Brand Group Log # 77-11(7)). These concepts cover a broad range of product types, so that development effort may become more focused, an ordering of the concepts based on consumer acceptance is needed. This ordering will use a methodology which will compliment that being done currently during the first stage concept screening.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

To: Mr. Herb Foster Date: May 19, 1989

From: J. L. Myrick

Subject: VIRGINIA SLIMS SUPERSLIMS SIDESTREAM MEASUREMENTS

We believe our laboratory research can support the SuperSlims
advertising claim of 70% less smoke from the lit end of the cigarette
as compared to the leading 100 mm brand, and 60% less smoke from the lit end as
compared to Capri.

This research utilizes an instrument which measures the amount
(intensity) of light which passes through the smoke plume of eight
cigarettes under laboratory conditions. The light source is a Helium-Neon
laser operating at a wave length of 543.5 nanometers.

The measured value for the VIRGINIA Slims SuperSlim cigarette used in
the advertising photography is equivalent to the measured value expected for
the commercially manufactured product.

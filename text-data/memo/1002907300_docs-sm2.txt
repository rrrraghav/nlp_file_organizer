MEMORANDUM March 3, 1972

TO: Joseph F. Cullman, III Curtis H. Judge

Edwin P. Finch

FROM: Horace R. Kornegay

Enclosed you will find a copy of a letter from Mr. Harry
Z. Rosenberg, Executive Vice President of Gray Industries,
Inc., referring to conversations and correspondence Gray
Industries had with Senator Clements in 1966 with respect
to the beneficial application of the "Gray Process" for
tobacco and tobacco products. Our files disclose that
copies of the correspondence and pertinent materials sup-
plied by Gray Industries through Dr. Saunders were sent
to the executives of our member companies on December 12,
1966. I think my letter of acknowledgement to Mr. Rosen-
berg is self-explanatory.

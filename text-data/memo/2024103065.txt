RE: WRA/SA Meeting Follow-Up

Following up on the recent WRA/SA meetings in snowy, New York, attached are the notes that everyone suggested and were written down on the flip charts.

As we agreed, responsibility for follow-up goes to those individual(s) whose name(s) appear next to certain items. You will notice that certain items are not attributable to an individual at this time; Richard & I have discussed this and determined that these will need further discussion at the next meeting.

The next meeting will be a video conference call, scheduled from 9:30--11:00 AM on Tuesday, March 8. At this meeting will be begin the follow-up process of those items designated to an individual(s), action items and also other undesignated points from the list to continue the excellent dialogue that was a result of the recent meeting. An agenda will be circulated prior to this meeting.

Also, as you read through the list, should you have any suggestions, etc. that need to be incorporated into the main document, please let us know. Thanks.

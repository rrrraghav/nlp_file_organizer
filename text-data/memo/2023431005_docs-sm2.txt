INTER - OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Richmond, Virginia

To: Mr. J. E. Schardt Date: December 8, 1989

From: R. D. Kinser

Subject: Information for PMT Patent Application

Dr. V. Malik and Dr. H. Nakatani have assembled the attached documenta-
tion of experimental details and results regarding isolation of the tobacco
enzyme PMT as requested by representatives of Fish & Neave. In keeping
with our understanding of the request, these reports have been prepared to
be technically accurate with little concern given to format and style.
Because our interactions with Protein Database, Inc. involved 2-D
gel electrophoresis being incorporated into our isolation procedures, no
description of those methods is included. Please let us know if more
information is needed.

EPA Risk Assessment Report

There are unconfirmed reports that EPA Administrator
Reilly and HHS Secretary Sullivan will hold a major press
conference at the National Press Club on January 7, to once
again release the "final" EPA Risk Assessment report
characterizing tobacco smoke as a “Class A carcinogen.” They
are expected to indicate that there are only 12 printed copies
of the Report presently available, and that they are being
forwarded to Congressional leaders.

The Tobacco Institute and Congressman Bliley are being

alerted.

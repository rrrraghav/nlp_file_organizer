TO MEMBERS OF THE SALES ORGANIZATION IN THE METROPOLITAN
AREA OF NEW YORK CITY

The New York Metropolitan area has more people, more
purchasing power, more visitors from out of town, more
stores selling cigarettes and …

MORE CIGARETTE SMOKERS

than any other area of the country.

BUT … we are not getting our rightful share of business
in a market accounting for close to 10% of total cigar-
ette sales in the United States. And we mean to get
that rightful share by taking the following action:

IMMEDIATE

1. Divide present Section E2A into two Sections,
effective Monday, November 4, 1968.

2. Sales Section E2A, under the supervision of
Section Sales Manager C. T. Stadler, will be
comprised of New York, Bronx, Westchester,
Putnam, Dutchess, Ulster, Sullivan, Orange and
Rockland Counties in New York and Fairfield
County in Connecticut.

3. Sales Section E2C, under the supervision of
Section Sales Manager B. Verdrager, will be
comprised of Richmond, Kings, Queens, Nassau
and Suffolk Counties in New York.

FUTURE PLANS

1. Add more manpower where required.

2. Assign a Female Sampling Representative to
each of the two Sales Sections headquartered in
New York.

3. Authorize afterhours sampling of special affairs.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA



To: Departmental Records Coordinators Date: October 11, 1990

From: L. M. Cummings  Lewis

Subject: : RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PROCEDURES

The attached procedures have been developed for the inventory and maintenance of records for your functional area. The procedures have been reviewed and endorsed by the Records Management Joint Task Force, the Philip Morris USA Legal Department, and the law firm of Hunton and Williams. The implementation of these procedures is dependent upon the Records Management Inventory System being fully operational. According to the Information Services Department, the system will be fully operational by December 31, 1990.

The procedures are in compliance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual with one exception. The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual states that Disposal Notices are signed by functional heads whereas these procedures indicate that Disposal Notices are signed by department managers. The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual will be revised to indicate that this is the responsibility of department managers.

It has been recommended to the Records Management Joint Task Force that these procedures be included in the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual as an appendix, and a decision on this matter is pending.

These procedures should prove to be highly beneficial in assuring that your department's records are managed in accordance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management Program, and it is anticipated that you will realize greater efficiency in managing records upon implementation of these procedures.

If you have any questions or require interpretation of these procedures, please contact me at extension 5943.

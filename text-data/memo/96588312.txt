Subject: Merchandising – EXCEL

Please be guided by the following updates:

• As you know, we shipped 4 color prints of the new Promotion Center and Lorillard Carton Fixture for presentation purposes at EXCEL meetings. You will receive 4 color pages for the EXCEL Brochure Carton Section. The color pages shipped will have all specifications and are suitable for retail chain and independent presentations. These pages will be mailed next EXCEL and should be inserted behind the “Carton Merchandising” sheet in your EXCEL Brochure.

• Please discard the 3 pages of Package Merchandising Sell Sheets that are in the EXCEL Brochure. The Sell Sheets that were inserted in your EXCEL Merchandising manual have superseded these pages.

• Newport & Wide Riser Cards (General Market, Urban, Spanish) were not included as part of the P.O.S. Advertising “Kit” that are inside EXCEL Display Kits. They are being developed and will be shipped to all locations that received an EXCEL 8-Wide Display as soon as production is complete.

Please contact me with any questions,

M.T.

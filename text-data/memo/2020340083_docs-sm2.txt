Subject: Summary for the week of April 10, 1991

I am making modifications to the RTX device software that will cause the application of power to the heater in a "pulse duration" mode the length of time negative pressure is being applied to the puff sensor. I am in the process for modifying, recompiling, testing and debugging the software.

I am having an energy controller circuit designed and built by Development engineering. The purpose of this circuit is to test the effects of varying the frequency of the energy pulse applied under pulse width modulation control. That is, perhaps there is an optimum frequency that battery life will be prolonged. May 10, is the estimated completion date.

I am involved in testing and changing the RTX device software to produce the different power profiles needed to test subjective response and battery life.

Subject: BELAIR Consumer Promotion Proposal Date: June 20, 1975

Purpose:

This document forwards a recommendation for a consumer promotional
program to be implemented during the third quarter of 1975. This
trial for BELAIR from key target market segments. The program
details are outlined below and execution is slated for July
and August 1975.

Promotional Goals:

The goals of our 1976 First Quarter promotion are:

1) To achieve broad reach trial among male and female
consumers (25-49).

2) To support our current franchise by providing a
short-term reason to continue purchasing BELAIR.

3) To create excitement and meaningful increase at
retail.

4) To provide the opportunity of improving the
effectiveness of our advertising in key geographic
markets.

5) To reduce unbranded product (generic) preference.

Promotional Concept:

After considering many alternative promotional devices, the
marketing team has determined that a sampling program will provide
the most efficient and effective means of achieving widespread
trial and generating positive consumer response.

Specifically, we are proposing a program of bundled two packs
of BELAIR Kings or Super Lunges to consumers when they mall in
coupons found on promotional shelf talkers located at retail
outlets. The coupon will entitle the consumer to one free package.
Additional publicity will be secured through tie-in with CBS
television programming. We have also developed a series of
incentive and sweepstakes based upon both the
consumer and retailer's participation in such program.

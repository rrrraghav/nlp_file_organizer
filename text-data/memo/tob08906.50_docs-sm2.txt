see it.

Ann,

My compliments to you and your staff on
this new publication. It's a beauty and should be
in the hands of every parent of teenagers. As
a parent whose two boys were heavy into "pot" and
booze, I would have welcomed such a booklet to aid
my handling such a situation. You’re doing a great
job, and I’m proud to be associated with you.

RE: LORILLARD MARKET OVERVIEWS – BASED ON
EXCEL RETAIL DATA FOR 12 MONTHS ENDING JUNE, 2000

Attached are Lorillard Market Overviews for the 12 months ending June, 2000 based on EXCEL Retail Data. These data reflect the location of each retail store being supplied by wholesalers participating in our EXCEL Program. In contrast, MSA Shipment Data are based on the location of each wholesaler’s warehouse and are, therefore, less representative of actual consumption within a market.

Total volume reported by EXCEL participants represents approximately 50% of corresponding national industry shipments and 406,297 retail stores.

Specific data summarized for the Industry, key market segments, and companies by brand in each Lorillard Area, Region, and Division include the following:

% of U.S. Volume
Share of Market
Share point change vs. year ago
Share Development Indices (SDI) vs. U.S. levels

In addition, the total number of retail stores on which data are based are shown for each market. Finally, note that EXCEL data cover all manufacturers and brands. As a result, totals shown for “All Other Manufacturers” include all available products.

Following is a brief summary of full price versus discount brand trends by Area (listed in order of their importance to Lorillard).

FULL PRICE BRANDS
Full price share based on EXCEL data is down slightly (-3 to -33%) in all points except the Western Area (+7.2 point).

In total, the top six full price brands – Marlboro, Newport, Camel, Winston, Pall Mall, and Benson & Hedges – garnered 63.9% of U.S. volume in June 2000. The five leading discount brands were Keystone, Coronado, L&M, Fox, and Santa Fe, accounting for 25.1% of total U.S. volume.

From: Joanna Sullivan C.C.: Distribution
Subject: Draft Action Plan for EC Transport Directive

Attached are my initial thoughts on an Action Plan to defeat the proposed smoking ban
contained within the EC Transport Health and Safety proposed Directive.

I look forward to receiving any comments/additions/deletions you may have in order that
this might be sent out to the Corporate Affairs Field managers as agreed at the last Field
meeting.

Regards,

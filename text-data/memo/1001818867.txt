PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

To: Mr. J. S. Crichton Date: May 16, 1975

From: J. S. Osmalov

Subject: Low Alkaloid Cigarette 3Al for the University of Kentucky

Attached for your information is a letter from Dick Barbella
of the University of Kentucky regarding production of the
3Al low alkaloid cigarette. Please note that the production
date will be targeted for late 1975 or early 1976. A new
cost estimate based on production of 1.1 million cigarettes
needs to be generated and transmitted to the University of
Kentucky for approval. By copy of this memo to Wayne Saunders,
I am requesting that such a new cost estimate be prepared
taking into account the reduced number of cigarettes (origi-
nally five million) and possible labor and material cost
increases which may occur either at the end of this year
or early next year.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

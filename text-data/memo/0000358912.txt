SUBJECT: COMPARISON OF PARENT CONTROL CIGARETTES TO NICOTINE ADDUCTS

Per your request, statistical comparison of parent control samples to
samples treated with nicotine adducts was made. The control
cigarettes used were the parental cigarettes. In treatment
#1 propylene glycol was used in the product application. In treatment
#2 a mixture of propylene glycol and glycerol was applied.
The treatments were applied at 30% solids. The parent-control
samples were stored for 4 weeks, and then the treated samples
were stored for 3 weeks, 5 weeks, and 6 weeks. The cigarettes used
in this study were manufactured one day prior to the manufacture of
Treatment 2 and 3.

Results

The statistical analysis indicates results as statistically
significant differences in parent control samples. Treatment
#1 showed a significant difference (P<0.05) from the control.
Treatment #3 showed a significant difference (P<0.01) from the
control.

After four weeks of aging, there was no
statistically significant difference between control and
the bulk of the test treatments.

The total milligrams of nicotine composites are provided below.
There was a statistically significant difference in the amount
of nicotine. The level of significance was 0.01.

SUBJECT: SWITCHING STUDY ANALYSIS

Eve,

To lend off, I’d like to thank you, Karen, Naney, and Margo for what I believe was a very productive and informative day. We were able to cover several topical areas (OOH, today's show, Book of the Month Club), obtain resolution on formatting of the switching study, cover "Evolution of the BELAIR Property" and I still made my plane with fifteen minutes to spare!

This memo is to confirm our discussions concerning the outline and specific formulas we will use in doing the Key Findings portion of the study. To reiterate, the general outline for Key Findings will follow that of the last BELAIR switching study:

A. BELAIR Gains and Losses

B. Sources and Destinations of BELAIR Business

C. Current Smokers

D. Starters

E. Quitters

F. Loyals

G. Switching Gains

H. Switching Losses

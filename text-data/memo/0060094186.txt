This serves to recommend a field affixed CARLTON $3.00 I.S.C. with bounceback for three $2.00 coupons to begin on January 4, 1993 in CARLTON 400+ volume opportunity outlets.

BACKGROUND

The CARLTON opportunity program which began in April 1992 has given us the chance to target our CARLTON sales promotions in those outlets that service a higher ratio of CARLTON purchases.

RATIONALE

The use of $3.00 I.S.C. with bounceback promotions in CARLTON opportunity outlets (400+ ) will create excitement for the CARLTON consumers and stimulate consumer pull at retail, while sheltering three additional carton purchases with the $2.00 bounceback coupons. In addition, CARLTON will be featured on separate floor displays in these high visibility outlets. This promotion will offset some of the potential out-switchers that are defecting due to I.S.C.’s on Full Revenue Ultra Low Tar and Price Value Ultra Low Tar, and stimulate repeat purchases.

RECOMMENDATION

A $3.00 field affixed I.S.C. with bounceback (three $2.00 coupons) will be implemented in CARLTON Opportunity outlets, where a floor display can be secured. Based on individual Field display opportunities, the program will promote 148,000 cartons during this twelve week coverage. The Western Field will not be included in this promotion. A carton cash card continuity program will be tested in the Western Field on February 22, 1992. This program will be approved under a separate proposal.

Memorandum

To: Dr. W. Relnnghaus
From: R. A. Carchman
Date: 26 January, 1995
Subject: Support

I am asking for your help in preparing a critique of the linear extrapolation
of carcinogenicity with the goal to address the key claims by OSHA and
EPA against ETS. The critique should list the principal limitations of this
model as well as alternate models and list referenced examples, where
threshold situations for carcinogens have been identified.

The document should provide the pertinent arguments and their sources; it
may include quotes by scientists and should be in as simple as possible
layman’s language.

I am considering the inclusion of this document into the OSHA post hearing
comment, which will be collected in draft form by the end of February ‘95. In
addition this critique will be of great importance in our efforts with respect to
IARC.

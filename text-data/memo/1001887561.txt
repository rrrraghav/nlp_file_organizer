Subject: 3912 without Burley Spray

3912's without burley spray were evaluated against 3912 controls
and each was compared to Kool for the purpose of establishing
if elimination of the burley spray would make 3912 more Kool-
like. Evaluations were carried out both by the Flavor Develop-
ment Group and by SEF-Lab.

The results of these evaluations showed that although differences
were detected between the 3912's, the experimental 3912 was
not found to be more Kool-like than the 3912 control.

The findings of the evaluations are summarized below:

SEF-Lab (N=29).

One pack of Kool 85’s was given to each panelist before the test
in order that he could familiarize himself with its smoking
characteristics. On the day of the evaluation, the panelists were
asked not to smoke an hour before the test. The actual test
involved smoking one cigarette and mentally comparing it to a Kool. The following questions were asked:

1. Which cigarette is more similar to Kool smoked the night before?
2. Can you see a difference between the two cigarettes?
3. If “yes,” describe.
4. Do you have a preference?
5. Which cigarette?

asked to indicate which of the 3912's was more kool-like (no choice
included) and to comment. The results for the

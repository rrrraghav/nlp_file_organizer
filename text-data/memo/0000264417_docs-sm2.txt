This will recap Rich Lights newspaper advertising in New York City during
and after the strike.

As you know, our original budget for the three daily papers was $133.0.
From this we deducted the Boston 20-sheet buy ($42 used) and in your
October 31 memo to Don Johnston added back in $22.5 for a new budget
of $118.5.

During the strike, we ran one insertion in each of the following papers:

Cost
City News	$ 2,906
Daily Press	2,749
Bergen Record	1,449
New York Post	6,126
		$13, 230

With the remaining budget of $101.1, I have approved the following schedule
which began this week:

New York News
6 insertions (2 per week for frequency discount)	$36,737

New York Times
5 insertions (one per week)		$29, 785

New York Post
5 insertions (one per week)		$33, 320
					$99, 842

If you have any questions, please call.

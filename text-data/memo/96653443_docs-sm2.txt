MEMORANDUM

July 29, 1994

TO: J. R. Reid
FROM: M. B. Bennett
SUBJECT: Status of the 1994 Testing Program Budget

Testing Program underspending increased this month by approximately
$100,000. However, this amount is balanced by the July shipment of
test compounds which, due to charges pending guidelines, will not
appear in the budget until next month. Again, the balance of
underspending is related to delays in initiation of subchronic
studies. The remaining subchronic study will be initiated in the
near future.

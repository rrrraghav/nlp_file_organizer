Dear John:

I am enclosing the initial estimates and scope of work needed to satisfy
the most recent Durham Fire Marshall’s inspection of the Durham plant.

The violations noted in Part 1 and Part 3 are for existing structures
which have been in place for many years. North Carolina started their
own fire code two years ago and this has started this new process.

The estimates and actual scope of work is still in the initial stages of
project and will be refined as we get more information on the fire
codes interpretation and the engineering needed once that is determined.

If you need further clarification, please call.



Sincerely,





James G. Gallotto
President and Chief
Executive Officer

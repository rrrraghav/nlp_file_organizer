VARIABLE FILTERS

Thank you for your note of 27 August on these novel filter patents for adjustable filters.

You have confirmed my own impression that these were complex assembly jobs and are disclosed in patents more as preventive actions than as protective ideas for commercial exploitation.

I cannot see any opportunity to exploit these ideas in our market but will seek a Marketing view about this. I would have doubts that the UK market is yet ready for this “self control” of smoking characteristics. The concept is too subtle for the market but if more official guidance on the benefits of filter ventilation were to be given, there might be the chance to develop such new ideas.

My own belief is that the average smoker wants a "fixed level" of ventilation and he would pick his brand according to that chosen level.

I think your notes are “for the files” rather than “for action”.

Perhaps the Cigarette Acceptability Working Party may take a different view. I shall be discussing the CAMF activities on 5 September.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

Subject: WEEKLY SUMMARY - Week Ending June 10, 1988

PROJECT AKT

a. Pilot Plant Summary

Three batches of CRS were cased with solutions of citric acid and
evaluated for use as a binder in the production of cigarette filters as an
alternative to the non-tobacco potassium silicate currently used. Also,
two batches of "MPC" cased stem were prepared and shipped on Thursday
and Friday.

b. Process Development

The results of the MDT Production Simulation Trial are incomplete. The
physical analyses currently available include a/s and
a/v measurements. The a/s value is 13.34, while the final
silo was put above the 13% target at 13.36 OV. The filling power
analysis shows a CV of 12.0 with a CV of 6.6 cfg. The chemical and
particle size analyses will be available by end of next week.

An additional run on the VT separator in MDT Core I has been scheduled
to provide clumps for further clump reduction work. The feed material
to the VT separator will be a special "MPC" pilot plant run to
generate clogged filler for a breaker plate test. After the filter
passes through the VT separator it will be dried in line before shipment
in a steaming cylinder, probably in Semoworks.

STEM PILOT LINE SUPPORT (SS CRS)

Preparations are underway to replace and install the humid stem tunnel,
currently located outside the MDT area, with a new tunnel inside
of the pilot plant allowing the humid tunnel to be installed in-line before
the dryer. The new location would be adjacent to a side room from existing
dryer lines.

A formal Request for the purchase of an Admist conditioner for the D-
plant is being prepared. This equipment, if approved, will allow for
shortening the delivery schedule and be ready for inspection in the
current quoted 4-5 months call for the unit to be clear.

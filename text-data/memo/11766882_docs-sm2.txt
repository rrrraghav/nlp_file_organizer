INTERNAL CORRESPONDENCE

TO: L. E. Gravely

CC: H. H. Huber, D. L. Scholten, R. A. Gonterman

FROM: P. H. Doyle

DATE: October 9, 1992

SUBJECT: KOOL Lts KS AND 100’S CPT/273/281

The KOOL Lts KS and 100 CPT products were scheduled to be shipped on October
26, 1992; however, there has been a delay in the schedule.

The ship date for KOOL Lts KS has been rescheduled for November 5, 1992.
Because of the age difference between KOOL Lts 100 and Salem Lts 100, the KOOL
Lts 100 CPT is being delayed until January 1993.

If there are any problems with the new dates please call me as soon as
possible.

BREAKDOWN OF TOTAL COSTS AND CHARGES

— TRUE REPRINT MAILING
December 1967 - April 1968

Explanatory Notes

The Tiderock Corporation was instructed by The Tobacco Institute,
Inc., in December 1967 to make a mass mailing of reprints of the
article, "To Smoke or Not to Smoke — That is Still the Question,"
which appeared in the January 1968 issue of TRUE.

Tiderock directed the art work, setting of type, printing, and
mailing operations.

Recognizing that some manufacturers desired additional copies
of the reprint, Tiderock canvassed the companies, and bulk quantities
of the article were printed for manufacturers who requested them, on
the understanding that the companies would be billed, on a pro rata
basis, for the number they ordered.

The attached documents are intended to aid the accounting
personnel of The Tobacco Institute.

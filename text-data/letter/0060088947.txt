Re: Out-of-Home -- Washington, D.C. Subways

Dear Norm:

This is to advise you that Phase 4 of the Washington, D.C.
Metro System is due to open November, 1979. There will be
four new stations. These are:

    Court House
    Clarendon
    Ballston
    Virginia Square (Glebe Road)

These stations will require six additional Posters bringing
our total to seventy-five. The additional cost will be
$360 per month or $720 total additiona1 for November/December,
1979.

Funds for this can be transferred from the $4,750 released by
the Pioneer Bus Strike in July.

Sincerely,



     Byron

Dear Dr. Young:

Hopefully the FDA will continue to insist on the need to consider R. J. Reynolds’ new cigarette, FAVOR, as a drug for which a new drug application will be needed. It would be too bad if the safety and efficacy considerations which are validly enforced by the FDA for therapeutic health supporting drugs should not also be applied to recreational drugs such as nicotine. I suspect that the new “smoking article” proposed by R. J. Reynolds of nicotine would be equally effective for illicit drugs, especially marijuana and cocaine, and their control even more difficult.

Please keep up the good work.

Sincerely,

Robert W. Frelick, M.D.
Medical Director of
Chronic Diseases

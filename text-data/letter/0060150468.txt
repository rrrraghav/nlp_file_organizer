Dear Mr. Topol:

This addresses the letter you submitted in February, 1979, on behalf of six cigarette companies¹ in response to the Federal Register announcement raising specific questions regarding the Commission’s proposed methods for testing carbon monoxide (CO), “tar”, and nicotine in cigarette smoke (44 Fed. Reg. 37777):

1. Whether to use, in performing the above-described analysis, the smoking machine as described by B.C. Pillsbury and G. Merfeld at the 32nd Tobacco Chemists’ Research Conference, October, 1978, for the determination of “tar,” nicotine and carbon monoxide.

2. Whether the carbon monoxide determined with the new smoking machine should be reported as milligrams per cigarette.

3. Whether to modify the presently used method of "tar" and nicotine determination by using the method described in an article entitled, “Gas Chromatographic Determination of Nicotine Contained on Cambridge Filter Pads,” by John K. Wagner et al., as presented at the annual meeting of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, October, 1978.

¹ Comments were submitted on behalf of the six major tobacco companies: (American Brands, Brown & Williamson, Liggett, Lorillard, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds).

By letter dated February 22, 1980, these same cigarette companies objected to the initiation of CO testing by the staff before the Commission responded to their February, 1979, letter. At the time this letter was received, the staff had not started testing for CO. The staff waited to begin testing until it was directed to do so by the Commission.

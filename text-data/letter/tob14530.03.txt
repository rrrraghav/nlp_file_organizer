Charles Rose

Dear Charles:

On behalf of the member companies of The Tobacco Institute,
I want to thank you for your very special thoughtfulness in
joining with Congressmen Whitley, Broyhill and Biley to forward
our "Helping Youth Decide" material to other Members on
September 21. One early result is that several Members have
requested substantial numbers of copies to provide to
educational authorities in their districts.

We have also been encouraged by initial endorsements of the
project which we have received from organizations such as the
American Association of School Administrators, the National
Association of Elementary School Principals, the Institute for
Educational Leadership and the Board of Regents of the
University of New York.

We are convinced that parental guidance as contrasted with
public propaganda is the best way to help young teens avoid
premature decisions about adult activities. We believe our
project will be helpful to parents in this respect and we intend
to continue to promote it vigorously.

Thank you again for your generous support.

Sincerely,

Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

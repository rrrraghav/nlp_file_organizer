CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

Dear Tom:

This correspondence from
Dr. Homburger is self-explanatory.
I would imagine that other CTR
supporters have received the same
mailing.

We are referring this to Alex
Holtzman for response. If you have
any suggestions, I am sure Alex
would welcome them.

Cordially,

James C. Bowling

Mr. W. T. Hoyt, Executive Vice President
The Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A.

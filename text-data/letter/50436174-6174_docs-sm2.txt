Dear Dr. McAllister,

I would like to apply for a grant application to the Council for Tobacco
Research. I am currently an instructor at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center in the Department of Pathology & Microbiology. My current research is in
"The Involvement of ras Oncogene in Bladder Carcinogenesis." I have enclosed a
brief description of my proposed research for review by the Council.

I look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,

Angela M. Mann

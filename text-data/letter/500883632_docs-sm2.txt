1. A critique of an unpublished paper alleging the affect of passive smoking on the excretion of hydroxyproline was prepared for Dr. Colby.

Hydroxyproline in the urine is considered to be, in part, a result of the breakdown of collagen. The assumption being made by the authors is that higher levels of hydroxyproline in the urine is related to the destruction of the collagen in lung tissue. Destruction of collagen is assumed to be related to emphysema. A copy of the critique is attached.

2. Mrs. Teresa Lyalls completed the first week of the Facilities Services’ training course in the use of the word processing equipment.

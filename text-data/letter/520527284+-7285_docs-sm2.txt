Re: Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA)

Dear Mr. Andee:

You have contacted us in regard to the legality of certain cigarette manufacturers’ promotions under the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA). This letter is in response to that inquiry.

As you are aware, the Department issued TSB-M-00 (2/M) on March 3, 2000 stating that certain manufacturers' promotional programs known as "buy-downs" and "master-type" programs are prohibited under CMSA. Please reference that memorandum for details. It is the Department’s view that any change with regard to “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs would require statutory change by the Legislature.

Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the manufacturer's invoice and "buy one, get one free" (or "buy some, get some free") promotions. These programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction (including any price reduction due to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer’s invoice; (2) all cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer's brands in New York State are allowed to participate in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to specific retail dealers (other than for purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product). The industry has also offered manufacturer’s coupons. These are allowable under CMSA, provided that the coupon is either published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation, or mailed directly to the consumer by the manufacturer.

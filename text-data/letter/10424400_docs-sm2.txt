Dear Bob:

Thanks so much for letting me know about the
conference on May 15th. Unfortunately, I have a meeting
with the departmental chairman that day and it would be
a bit difficult to get off. Anyway, I will see you on
the 20th and 21st.

All good wishes and many thanks.

Sincerely,

                                        Dout
                                Richard J. Bing, M.D.

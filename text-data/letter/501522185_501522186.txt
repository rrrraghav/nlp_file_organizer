INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

TO: Dr. G. R. Di Marco

FROM: Alan Rodgman

SUBJECT: Weekly Highlights
Fundamental R&D

TOBACCO/SMOKE RESEARCH

Smoke Formation Studies

Modifications to the puff-by-puff smoking machine to allow study of the effect of puff frequency on puff-by-puff delivery profiles have been completed. The modifications which were made by Mr. Smythe will allow puff-by-puff smoke collection at puff intervals of 15, 45, and 90 seconds. Data collection has begun for a study which will examine the effects of both puff frequency and puff volume.

BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH

Entomology

In September 1983, Dr. Benezet presented a paper at the International Conference on Stored Product Entomology on the results of his research on beetle control with methoprene. He has been invited to present the paper in February at a course at the University of Kentucky on insect control.
Dr. Faustini from PM will also participate.

BIOBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

Nicotine Pharmacology

Pure, tritiated L-nicotine has been received, and studies of the nicotine binding sites in murine neuroblastoma are underway. Use of this new material has increased the sensitivity of the experiments two to four-fold.

Details for modification of the Zeiss microscope to allow its interfacing to the existing Bausch and Lomb Omnicon image analyzer have been worked out in conjunction with Dr. Dominguez and the technical support staffs at Zeiss and Bausch and Lomb. Upon final approval of the R&D, the microscope will be ordered and shipped to Bausch and Lomb for modification. Once this is complete it will be shipped to RJR for incorporation into the Omnicon system.

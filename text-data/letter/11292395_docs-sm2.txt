Dear Colter:

Thank for your letter of Labor Day. We set off for a
brief family vacation the next day and I have not had a chance to
reply.

We are very familiar with the work of Dr. Thomas since
we have been sponsoring parts of it for quite a number of years.
We are still helping her with some of the more specifically psycho-
logical aspects but she has now received substantial aid from the
National Institutes of Health. We think she is a very able invest-
igator.

I am interested in your own article and think it contains
some sound ideas. I will send copies of it to members of our study
group on the “psycho-physiological aspects of smoking”.

Enclosed is a copy of a paper I wrote some time ago but
which gives viewpoints I still hold on experimental approaches to
the lung cancer problem.

Kind regards,

Very sincerely yours,

RCK/tth                Robert C. Hockett, Ph.D.

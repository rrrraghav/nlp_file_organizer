Dear Roger:

On behalf of the Los Angeles Hospitality Coalition, I want to thank you in advance for your support of our efforts to qualify a referendum overturning the Los Angeles City smoking ban. If left unchallenged, the ban passed last week by the Los Angeles City Council would have a devastating impact on city restaurants, hotels and the entire Los An-geles hospitality industry.

We hope that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will make a contribution in the amount of $71,619.00. Please forward your check to the attention of Cary Davidson at 777 Figueroa Street, Suite 3400, Los Angeles, CA 90017. As this effort is extremely time sensitive, please have your check or wire to our office or bank on July 1, 1993 if at all possible.

Again, thank you for agreeing to help preserve a positive, competitive business climate for the Los Angeles city hospitality industry.

Sincerely,

Lee Stitzenberger

Dear Dr. Wakeham,

Dr. Hüusermann of Philip Morris Europe has been kind
enough to arrange a visit at Philip Morris in Richmond. He
gave me several days which are convenient for you.

I am flying next Sunday to the United States and try to
get to Richmond on Sunday or Monday. The hotel reservation
has been made at Holiday Inn Center.

Since the 25th October would be convenient for you, I
will be at your office this day between 9 and 10 a.m. I will
call your office on Monday 24th to ask if this time is con-
venient for you also.

Looking forward to meet you in Richmond, I am,

Yours very truly,
CHEMICAL LABORATORY

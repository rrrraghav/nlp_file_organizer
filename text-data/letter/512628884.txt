SUBJECT: Strip Nicotine Variation Control Test

From: J. B. Wilson

To: Mr. T. J. Porter

Bob Shore and I have reviewed with Leaf Processing and Storage and PT&D the logistics of the proposed strip nicotine variation control test. Originally, this test was to have been conducted using 1990 Georgia tobaccos. The early market dates and subsequent PT&D equipment delays necessitates a shift in test design from Georgia tobaccos to Old Belt tobaccos.

The objective of this test is to determine whether meaningful improvement in strip nicotine measurement variations can be achieved through on-line green leaf nicotine measurement and subsequent stemmery infeed blending. A three part test using 4X OB 90 tobacco will be conducted. Each test leg will be limited to approximately half a shift at Brook Cove. A line nicotine values for bailed green leaf tobacco will be measured at Davis County Prizerry prior to shipment to Brook Cove. The following test design will be used:

A-Leg: as received tobacco, no special market mixing at either Davis County or Brook Cove.

B-Leg: as received tobacco, maximum market mixing at Brook Cove in-feed.

C-Leg: nicotine tagged tobacco from Davis County, pre-determined blending ratio of high, mean, and low nicotine level tobaccos per crop grade target, blending at Brook Cove in-feed.

Inter-office Memorandum

Subject: Work Proposal Date: July 27, 1972

To: Dr. A. H. Laurene From: Dr. Charles Rix

OBJECT: To study means of flavoring TC devices to further augment the taste of very low tar (less than 10 mg) cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION: New TC devices have many advantages, the most obvious of which is lessened tar delivery. Air dilution causes smaller amounts of mainstream smoke to reach the consumer. Present TC cigarettes have desirable flavor. However, if tar levels were to continue to drop lower, perhaps to less than 10 mg/cigarette, lessened flavor might result. It is this possible reduction in taste which makes the successful addition of flavorants to plastic TC devices desirable.

PROPOSAL: It is suggested that a study of flavor transfer from TC devices be initiated. The flavorant would of necessity be held in a solid matrix, either on an absorbent granule or in a permeable solid. The project would ascertain the delivery properties of model compounds such as menthol, nicotine or flavorants to the mainstream smoke. It would require the services of one B.S. chemist for approximately 6 months. No new capital expenditures for equipment would be required.

Mr. Bowman Grey

Dear Bowman:

Following my letter to you of December 23,
1960, this will advise you that we have received word
from each of the five companies approached by Dr. Kotin
for funds. With the exception of the P. Lorillard
Company, each has given assurance that financial aid
will be extended to the University of Southern California
School of Medicine as requested by Dr. Kotin. Funds will
be provided in accordance with the proportion and according
to the formula used by the FFEC, which was attached to my
letter to you of December 6, 1960.

With best personal regards.

Sincerely,

T. W. Barnettt
Chairman

Dear Bob:

Several points evolved after the D-llas groups as relates to the "Untamed" campaign.

First, the consumer needs a call-to-action. “Come to Marlboro Country”, “Fly the Friendly Skies”, “Discover Monthol Refreshment” are examples of a consumer call-to-action as we perceive it.

The group members seemed to need help in making the transition from "Untamed" to the animal visual to a cigarette offering. This needs to be smoothed and made easy for the reader.

Second, package visibility needs to be improved. Several comments were made with the basic thought being that the group member did not know he/she was looking at a cigarette ad. The relationship (size) perceptions) of the animal and the package needs to be improved.

Third, benefit needs to be communicated directly and immediately. The campaigns that were best received had the consumer benefit up front. The weaker ones did not.

Next Steps

Using “Spirit” as the working name, I would like to see additional approaches incorporating the above comments. For review purposes, I want these kept in tissue form as you did before.

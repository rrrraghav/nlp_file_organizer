① HELLO

Dear Jim:

I am delighted to have your response indicating your willingness to join the FMI task force to work out a common industry-wide approach to underage access. I have already had contact from other major industry associations asking if they can also join this group as we had hoped they would. Incidentally, I hope you appreciate our keeping this dialogue out of the media. The recent Wall Street Journal article featuring one of the other distributor associations is certainly not reflective of the way we like to do business.

Best regards,

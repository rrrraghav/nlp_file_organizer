Agency Memo
RJR

TO: Mr. P. K. Shaner

AGENCY: William Esty Company

FROM: R. S. Tatum

DATE: July 16, 1985

SUBJECT: Fourth Quarter SALEM Advertorial Scheduling

This forwards, as requested by the Agency, the cover
dates, on-sale dates, and material closing dates for
SALEM advertorials in the fourth quarter. This
information should assist you in planning execution of
the rotating warning statements for the advertorial
program. Execution of this new procedure with respect
to advertorials will require particularly careful
planning since lead times for advertorials are so
long.

Please be sure that all rotating warning statement
guidelines are followed in preparing materials for
this program.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Re: Coupons and Sales Tax in South Carolina

Dear Ron:

I have discussed the above matter with Frank Skinner of our tax department, who is knowledgeable in area. He also believes that there is a problem with the way South Carolina is approaching this matter and is willing to offer his help.
Please feel free to call him at (336) 741-0262.

I assume this was the subject of your call the other week; however, if it is not, please give me a ring.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely yours,

Tom

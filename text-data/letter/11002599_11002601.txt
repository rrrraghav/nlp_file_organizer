Dear Dr. Hockett:

I have delayed writing you thinking we would hear from
Dr. Finlay. Since we have not, I think it best to proceed to outline
those studies that interest us.

1. To determine whether ⁹²Zr is in gas or particulate phase of cigarette
smoke and whether ⁹²Zr added as a spike to cigarettes is deposited in
dogs the same as produced by neutron activation. This work could
lead to a simple method for safely measuring deposition of smoke
products in both experimental animals and man.

Estimated cost is about $10,000.

2. To investigate the interactions between alveolar phagocytes and
tobacco smoke particles in smoking dogs. The phagocytosis of tobacco
tare has been documented (Walloe, R. C., 1956. Proc. Am. Assoc.
Cancer Research 2: 325) but the extent to which phagocytosis contributes
to clearance of tobacco smoke particles from the lungs and the effect
of tobacco smoke on the morphology and function of the phagocyte are
unknown. Therefore, we propose to investigate the following using the
lung lavage technique:

a. Rate of phagocytosis of tobacco smoke particles.
b. Rate of clearance of tobacco smoke particles from the lung by
phagocytosis.
c. Whether the phagocyte-clearing mechanism can be "overloaded"
by heavy smoking.

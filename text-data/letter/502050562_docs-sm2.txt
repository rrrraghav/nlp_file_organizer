Dear Mr. McCall:

Thank you for your letter of February 7, 1964.

Quite a few of our friends have suggested or offered to disclose lines of research which might clarify the large gapa in existing knowledge of the relation of tobacco to health.

We want you to know we appreciate the constructive approach you and your client have adopted. However, we have thought it best not ourselves to engage in the type of research your letter contemplates. Instead, since 1954 we have supported the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, 150 East 42nd Street, New York 17, New York, which has made grants totaling several million dollars to independent scientists engaged in a coordinated program of research into questions of tobacco use and health.

Again, many thanks for taking the trouble to write us on this important matter.

Very truly yours,

Robert D. Rickert

Dear Susan:

Enclosed please find three sets of labels for the Vantage 1994 Program Focus Groups.
There is a different set of print for each of the priority groups of zip codes, depending
on the distance from the facility. There are 716 names in the priority group 1 set
of labels, 463 in priority group 2, and 647 in priority group 3.

Each label contains a Personal Identification Number, ten-digit telephone number,
name, address, city, state, and five-digit zip code. The last line of each label is brand
code, age, and sex.

The brand code "88" stands for Vantage, and every person included in these labels

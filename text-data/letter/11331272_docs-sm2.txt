Dear John,

Thanks for your letter. I have reviewed Tim’s report as well as Pat's latest progress note to me. You will find enclosed a copy of my advice to Pat. I am very interested in knowing what antiserum Chick Turner used for the CF test. We may need to use the anti-hamster leukemia virus serum for all our testing. Positive results would be very provocative.

I am now in the process of arranging my charter flight to California in November. I have obtained a ticket on a plane arriving in San Francisco about November 10.

I had one idea which may make our meeting more convenient for you and at the same time enable me to visit NIH to get some supplies and finish up some paper writing there. Is it possible for CTD to pay my trip from San Francisco to New York? I would leave the Monday after the conference (November 15). We could spend one or two days together and then I’ll go down to Washington. I can get a charter flight from New York to Paris very easily but must make a reservation very soon.

If you prefer meeting me in California, I shall reserve the return flight from there. Await your reply.

Looking forward to talking with you.

Have lots to share with you.

Best regards.

Jay

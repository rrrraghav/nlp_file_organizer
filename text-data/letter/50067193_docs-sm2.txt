Dear Carl:

We’ve received your letters and agree with you concerning the
numerical errors you have detected. We are working hard on the important
and thought-provoking criticism you raised concerning the interpretation
of the results of controlling for smoking quantity, and will be back in
touch with you shortly about this.

Vince Lisanti was here last week and I did tell him that the manuscript
would not be ready by July.

I’m sorry that June and July are out of the question for your next visit
here, but hope that the earlier week in August might be feasible. Mean-
while, I expect we will be able to work out some of our disagreements by
letter and phone.

With best regards.

Sincerely,

Hay

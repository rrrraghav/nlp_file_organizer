Dear Gerron:

This is in response to your recent letter in regard to the post pane-
ment of double coupons, and the next steps in terms of production.

A final decision will be made on double coupon in late November.
As you know, Management has decided both brands or neither brand
unless new data dictates otherwise.

Assuming that BELAIR does go national with double coupons,
advertising would begin in mid-March.

We agree that the Basic Plan should be implemented in January,
and we agree that "Sailor" should be plated for supplements (and
7 x 10) based on the scores and diagnostics.

In regard to the National Enquirer, please clarify "undertaking
whatever test production may be indicated".

Based on recent correspondence, we are concerned about the
reproduction qualities of this vehicle, and wish to take whatever
steps are necessary in order to satisfy ourselves that the Enquirer
can handle the subtle color balance of the “treat yourself” executions.

Please call if you have any questions or comments.

Sincerely,

B. L. McCafferty

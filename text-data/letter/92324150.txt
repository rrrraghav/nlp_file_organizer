Re: Sale of B&W’s export Newport cigarettes in the United States.

Dear Mike:

It was a pleasure meeting with you at the I.N.T.A. I am looking forward to working with you on the RL contract and the bootleg goods issue.

As we discussed it has come to Lorillard's attention that quantities of Newport cigarettes manufactured by B&W are being illegally sold in the United States. Our Sales representative has purchased two packs of cigarettes at retail in Connecticut. Particulars are enclosed.

We would appreciate learning what information you obtain with respect to the extent and the source of these infringing goods. Please contact us if you require any further help with respect to this matter.



Very truly yours,





Ronald S. Goldbremner

INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

RUR MC/b
SECRET

SUBJECT: Status of Toxicological DATE August 23, 1987
Approval of Materials No. 410 By
in ALPHA Products

TO: Dr. A. W. Hayes FROM: R. A. Lloyd

As you know, we have adopted a standard product and are
currently in process of starting up production machinery in
Building 631. This is necessary to develop a solid production
process capable of manufacturing quality, consistent product
in volume sufficient for test market introduction in early
'88 and to support later national expansion.

In order to meet this ambitious schedule, we must
finalize specifications for raw materials and components so
that our suppliers can scale up their processes to meet our
expanding needs beginning now. As a result, I need your input
as soon as possible if we are to meet the projected
introduction date.

Please provide in writing the status of the toxicological
recommendation for use in the ALPHA product of the following
materials:

Silica Gel Flow Agent
Attapulgite Clay
Kaolin Clay
Microglass
Flavor Systems
Alumina
Polypropylene Fabric
Papers
Tipping
Glass Fiber Mat
TiO2
Chalk

If additional information is needed, please indicate the
nature and how it will be used in formulating your
recommendation.

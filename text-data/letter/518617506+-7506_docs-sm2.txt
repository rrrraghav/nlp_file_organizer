DORAL SEPTEMBER B2G1#601270

I will be forwarding two sub-jobber templates (Fedele, SIS #674281 and New
Milford Tobacco, SIS #394648) for accounts located within Region 16XX which
are supplied by your direct account, Montano #960059.

I have transferred one case of each Doral style to cover distribution to these
accounts (30 Displays), and 30 SKU’s of sleeves (Item #512141). Please include
these templates with Montano's distribution for this promotion.

Thanks for your help.



Sincerely,
Judy Campbell
Promotional Coordinator / #1610

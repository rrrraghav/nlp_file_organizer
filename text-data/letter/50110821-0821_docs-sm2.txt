Dear Mr. Hoyt,

Re: Grant #9864

I thank you for your letter of 13th September 1979, and very much
regret that due to staffing problems, it has not yet been possible to provide
the information requested in your two earlier letters. It is hoped that we
should be able to send you this fairly soon.

Again with my apologies. Yours sincerely,

D. Bradshaw

I. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH DIVISION

A. Avoca Farm

A.- Tobacco Crop
Tobacco harvested mechanically and bulk cured randomly sold
7-8¢ per pound less than tobacco hand primed and cured conventionally.

In other experiments, quality was also below average, perhaps
owing to chlorine damage. Excess chlorine may be attributable to
one or more of the following possibilities: (1) already present
in soil, (2) manure, (3) fertilizer.

b.- Flavy Farm Research

Deep plowed and heavily limed fields show promise of productivity
where previously all sage plantings failed to survive.

II. Aluminum Insulation for Curing Barns

Leaf quality appraisal and records of fuel consumption indicate
equal quality and a saving of $4.75 per cure where the barns were
insulated.

III. Evaluation of Tobacco

A.- New Flue-Cured Tobacco Varieties - North Carolina

Smoking flavor comparisons were made on 43 samples of a number
of varieties.

b.- Farmers’ Barley Samples

Approximately 100 samples have been analyzed. Nicotine values
are averaging higher than in previous years.

a.- Flue-cured Tobacco Lines - South Carolina

smoking flavor and chemical evaluations were made on 36 lines.

A.- Flue-cured Tobacco Lines - North Carolina

smoking flavor and chemical evaluations were made on 60 samples.

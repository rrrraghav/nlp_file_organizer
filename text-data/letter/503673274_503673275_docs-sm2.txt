Dear Bill,

Confirming our telephone conversation,
enclosed is a letter from Dr. Rao, together with detailed
proposals for research support, a budget of $15,000 for
one year, and a copy of a paper related to that work,
which, as you will note, has been accepted for publication
in the British Medical Journal.

As you know, it now appears that this research
is not appropriate for consideration as a CTR special
project. Nevertheless, the work is of obvious value.
Moreover, Dr. Rao’s past work and future plans include
research into several areas of obvious interest to us,
including further development of his work on lung cancer
as an endocrine disease.

As you and I have previously discussed, Dr. Rao
should be a most effective proponent of some of his views
and, under appropriate circumstances, might well be able
to provide useful information to a Congressional Committee
or other body inquiring into certain aspects of smoking
and health. Indeed, some of the work that he is doing on
smoking and pregnancy, while focused on the smoking mother,
would suggest that he might have important information to
impart in any consideration of claims of effects of smoking
upon fetuses or non-smoking mothers.

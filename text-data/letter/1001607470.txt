Dear Dr. Woodard;

This will confirm our recent telephone conversation regarding the
abstract which you submitted to the Toilet Goods Association for the
April 1968 symposium. The Program Planning Committee has accepted that
paper for presentation at the December 6, 1968, meeting in New York of
TGA’s Scientific Section. Further details will be sent to you, but for
now we ask that the final manuscript be submitted by October 6. The
abstract, "Systems Approach to the Safety Evaluation of Cosmetics," will
be published as you originally prepared it unless you wish to make re-
visions available to the TGA in the near future. I look forward to hear-
ing this provocative paper in December.

Sincerely yours,



R. A. SCAIA, PhD

Dear Mr. Gertenbach: Re: Grant No. 1565

In response to your letter of May 4 informing me of my grant award, I am enclosing the "Notice of Research Project" form now completed. Also, I have enclosed our Institutional Human Subject
Certification form which was filed here at the Institute when the
application was first submitted to you. If you still need to have
the additional Human Subject Form from your organization filled in,
I will be glad to do so. I hope our Institute form is sufficient.

Sincerely yours,

Heinz Kohler, M.D., Ph.D.
Director
Department of Molecular Immunology

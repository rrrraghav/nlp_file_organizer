Dear Ms. Helwig:

Thank you for your quick response to my request for a listing of the Plan’s 1998 payments to William M. Mercer, Inc., Covington & Burling and Coopers & Lybrand.

I have attached a copy of the 1998 Form 5500 Schedule C, Part I. Please check your records and provide me with information regarding other payments, if any, that should be reported on lines 1 and 2 or Schedule C, Part I.

Sincerely,

William A. Adams
Plan Administrator

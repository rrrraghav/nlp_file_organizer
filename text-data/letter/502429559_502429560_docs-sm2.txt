Dear Mr. Clofelter:

This is in reply to your inquiry concerning use of Eastman Kodak Company’s trademark ESTRON.

ESTRON is a trademark for acetate fiber or tow and therefore should not be used to identify filters. We suggest that you refer to your filter as an “acetate filter”, “acetate fiber filter”, or “fiber filter”. However, if you particularly wish to use the trademark ESTRON, the following statements are suggested (1 and 2 being preferred) as being lawful usage of the trademark in reference to filters manufactured entirely from ESTRON tow:

1. A filter of ESTRON® fiber
2. A filter of ESTRON® material
3. Filter of ESTRON®
4. All ESTRON® filter
5. 100% ESTRON® filter

(The asterisk in the above statements should refer to an explanatory footnote reading “fiber trademark” or “registered fiber trade-mark”. This footnote to appear in a reason-ably prominent position on the vehicle of publication such as package, carton, or advertisement.)

For protection of the trademark the word ESTRON must appear in a distinctive fashion. It should be capitalized, at least; or if the rest of the words in the phrase in which it appears are capitalized, ESTRON should receive some distinctive treatment such as quotation marks, different type face or type size, underlining, or color.

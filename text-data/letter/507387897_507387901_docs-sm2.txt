RE: Moviegoer - CAMEL Perspective.

As requested, the following is Media’s perspective on Moviegoer Magazine relevant to CAMEL's continued support/usage in 1987.

BACKGROUND

Moviegoer was developed in 1962 by the 3-C Corporation for exclusive use by the CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful impressions against better educated 18-34 year old males. Both Brand and Media management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of frequency/exposure in selected markets. Attached is the original authorization request submitted on May 7, 1961, which outlines key brand objectives.

The three major objectives of Moviegoer were: 1) reach portions of CAMEL’s target not reached by other magazines; 2) generate brand association/sponsorship ruboff and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment.

A five-year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per year. In 1983, SALEM became a co-advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL’s budget. Rate increases have averaged 9% per year and in 1986, the total Corporate commitment will be $7.4MM ($4.8MM Media, $2.6MM Promotions). Circulation has remained controlled at 1.2MM per year.

NEW PROPOSAL

Moviegoer has offered RJR a new three-year proposal (details attached). Briefly, the total yearly cost will be $5.6MM net (versus $7.4MM in 1985). Issues will be decreased from 12 to 10; the number of ad pages will be decreased from 60 pages (5 pages x 12 issues) to 52 pages (5 pages x 8 issues and 6 pages x 2 issues). Circulation will increase 46% from 1.2MM to 1.75MM in eight issues (and to 3.0MM or 150% for 2 issues). The number of mankets will decrease from 12 to 10 (ZIZ).

CURRENT RESEARCH

During the last five years, several studies have been conducted regarding Moviegoer’s readers. For purposes of this pipeline, we will summarize key research data/findings from these studies which we feel are relevant to CAMEL's perspective. Research data is summarized in Exhibit A attached, and a qualitative summary is provided below.

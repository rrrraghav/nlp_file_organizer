SUBJECT: KOOL MILDs 100 - COMPETITIVE PRODUCT TEST RESULTS

The following provides results of Kool 100's performance in the latest
SALEM Lights 100 competitive test. This competitive wave was to be the first
test of a nationally manufactured improved SALEM Lights 100 product against
its new action standard competitor, Kool Milds 100. However, the SALEM Lights
100 product picked up for this test was rejected due to low tar. Therefore,
only ratings for Kool Milds are available since past competitive waves tested
the previous SALEM Lights 100 product.

Results from Wave III, due in early November, will provide the next
opportunity to confirm the competitive status of the new SALEM Lights 100
product.

OVERALL ACCEPTANCE

Kool Milds’s overall acceptance ratings are extremely low among both
competitive and franchise smokers.

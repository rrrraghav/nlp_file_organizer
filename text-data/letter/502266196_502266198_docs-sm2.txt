TOBACCO AND SYNTHETIC TOBACCO PROJECTS

I. PUFFED TOBACCO

The study of puffing with volatile liquids, e.g., Freon-11, near ambient temperature has been continued to extend the useful range of operating conditions. The process has produced a 230% increase in cross-sectional area of flue-cured stem sections previously. The concentration of Freon-11 vapor in the atmosphere used to treat the stem sections has been estimated to be 5.4 mg./ml by MS. An attempt to estimate the quantity of Freon-11 absorbed by the stem sections continues.

The stem section method has been applied to puffing with aqueous CO2. Preliminary data (see table) establish the system as a possible basis for a puffing process.

Sections treated with H2O (200% by wt.), exposed to reduced P (1 mm.) for 1 hr. 85

II. CELANESE SMOKING MATERIAL

The Et2O-soluble portion of smoke condensate from 64,085 cigarettes containing Celanese smoking material was chromatographed on silícic acid to give 8 fractions. Investigation of the first two fractions has been completed; investigation of the third fraction is near completion, and the investigation of the fourth fraction is well underway.

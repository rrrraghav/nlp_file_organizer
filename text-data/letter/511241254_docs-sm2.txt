CONFIDENTIAL

Mr. G. R. Woodman
Secretary Additive Guidance Panel
Imperial Tobacco Limited
Lombard Street
Bristol BS-99JR, England

Dear Mr. Woodman:

Dr. Rodgman has informed me of your suggestion that he come over
to discuss certain aspects of the G-13 process in connection with
possible submission to the Hunter Committee.

Of course we are pleased to comply.

Because of my responsibility in the G-13 licensing program—
particularly this situation involving one of the largest cigarette
manufacturers in the world—I would like to attend these discussions.

I realize that the matters to be discussed are highly scientific
and outside my scope. Thus, I hope not to be intruding.

If for any reason unbeknown to me you feel it best that I not
attend, such a suggestion would not offend but would actually be
appreciated.

Unless I hear to the contrary, I shall accompany Dr. Rodgman.
And I look forward to the discussion with you and your associates.

Sincerely,

Haywood Smith

Haywood C. Smith

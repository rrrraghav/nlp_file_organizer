To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing in response to your proposal to regulate the sale distribution, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products. I have no quarrel with your goal of preventing underage use of tobacco products. My concern however, is the laws of this nation be made by the elected representatives of the people in Congress and not by un-elected bureaucrats accountable only to themselves.

For nearly 90 years, and on at least twenty different occasions Congress has specifically rejected legislation to grant FDA jurisdiction over tobacco, including seven occasions in the last few years. For the record, here is an account of Congressional activity on the issue of FDA jurisdiction over tobacco:

1929 - S. 1468 (71st Cong., 1st Sess) was introduced by Sen. Smoot to bring tobacco products within the jurisdiction of the Federal agency enforcing the nation’s drug laws. The bill did not pass.

1956 - H.R. 11280 (84th Cong., 2d Sess.) was introduced to amend the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to grant FDA regulatory authority over cigarettes. The bill did not pass.

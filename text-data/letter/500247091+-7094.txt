TO OUR DIVISION MANAGERS:

Beginning November 6, 1967, and terminating
December 8, 1967, you and your salesmen are to make to
the trade the WINSTON SUPER KING BOX Display Offers
specified by the attachments to this letter.

As with all display offers made available by
us, these offers should be made known and available to
all retailers and vendors promptly, and as nearly simul-
taneously as possible.

We believe you will welcome this renewal of
the WINSTON SUPER-KING BOX Display Offers and will
follow through with your salesmen to insure maximum
sales, distribution, and displays -- for outstanding
test market results in your Division.

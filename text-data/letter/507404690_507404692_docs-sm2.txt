SUBJECT: Event Status Report
CAMEL Grand Prix of Southern California at Del Mar
October 21, 1989 - October 23, 1989

CAMEL PRESENCE AT EVENT

The CAMEL signage as per EPP contract was in place, and we had CAMEL scoreboards, banners, pennant rope, trash bins, and inflatable. We did not have the old Joe inflatable as the plan for the golf folks to have the inflatable packed on the simulator truck and sent to Del Mar didn’t materialize, and we did not have the Old Joe inflatable there.

Comments: The track appeared to be less cluttered than in 1988, and we appeared to have a great deal more signage, particularly through usage of regular series banners. I want to look into getting some more special banners made to use in place of the series banners for 1990.

ON-SITE CONSUMER PROMOTION

The concession stand offer of “buy two packs and get a CAMEL GT lighter” was implemented by the Sales Force, and the pavilion and simulator were in operation for a special VIP preview on Thursday night and then it operated on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. There was a steady flow of consumers visiting these activities.

SALES/CUSTOMER ENTERTAINMENT

Sales hosted 25 plus customers on Saturday and Sunday. The Sales Force was very cooperative and indicated a desire to use this event as a major entertainment vehicle.
Tom Dahlien, Executive Vice President of Big Bear, was the Grand Marshal for the event, and numerous Big Bear Executives were entertained on Sunday. Sales implemented at retail “buy two packs get a free CAMEL GT lighter” in the San Diego Division.

Dear Dr. Stone:

This letter is in reference to our conversation of June 16 regarding the excess salary money in my present CTR grant (#1359).

In the original grant application, in order to devote the majority of my time to the research, I applied for salary money to support what is known as a "release unit." This means that I would be released from half of my teaching commitment in the upcoming fall semester. I later learned that I was scheduled for a release unit which did not require external funding. The result of this is that there will be approximately $600.00 in salary money on this year's budget which will remain unexpended. If the CTR agrees, and notifies the Controller of Wellesley, this money could be extended to next year’s budget. This would allow me to apply for much less new salary money on the budget of the renewal and still support a release unit for the fall of 1982.

I look forward to your visit of the 19th.

Sincerely,

Dennis M. Smith

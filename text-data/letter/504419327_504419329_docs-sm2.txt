Discussion: Agenda is attached.

Updates were given on the following Applied projects pertinent to FF prototype development efforts:

Shorts Testing (H. Young) - Shorts have been blended into the current WKS product at three usage levels – 0, 5, and 8%, and products were mailed out on MARC week of June 20. Topline results are due week of July 27. One usage level will be chosen as the standard to be used for production of WKS.

G7 vs C/Aged vs Unaged (H. Young) - Topline results from MARC panel tests indicated that young FFMN 85 smokers (excluding WINSTON) preferred product made with aged GTA over that made with aged G7 and franchise smokers had no preference for either. Franchise smokers did have a preference for aged G7 product (current) over that made with unaged GTA. Full report due within one week.

Reaction Flavors (A. Gonzalez) - Several reaction flavors from different suppliers are being tested in the WKS product for enhancement of tobacco taste and possibly smoothness. Two products containing reaction flavors are currently on Walker panels (results due 7-22-83) and an additional four are being evaluated by the Flavor Division.

Topline results for the following three additional studies are due within the next two weeks and primary investigators (including H. Young - Shorts Testing) have agreed to summarize test design and results at the Next Brands FF Team meeting in mid-August (15 minutes per study):

Tobacco Aging Study (L. Villegas)
Full Flavor ‘Tar’ Limit Study (C. Neumann)
Tobacco Nicotine Variation Study (L. Villegas)

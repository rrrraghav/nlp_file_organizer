ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF

• G7 Value - G7 is valued for blend costing purposes at $0.24/lb. The recently developed unit operations input-output model for G7 has been used to determine a more accurate value. After applying all changes against the final product, a more reasonable value for G7 is $0.60/lb.

• Outstanding Literature Scientist - The R&D Library has successfully hired an outstanding Senior Literature Scientist, Hana Roysypal has broad scientific training, extensive experience in library automation and was at one time chief librarian of the technical library of the CZECHOSLAVAK Academy of Sciences in Prague. She is also fluent in five languages. This hire will allow us to significantly accelerate and expand our advanced information retrieval activities that support all R&D programs.

• R&D Plant Lab - Effective June 1, the physical test lab in the R&D Plant under Bob Hoge will transfer to the Analytical Services Division. They will also begin to assume responsibility for a new function involving company-wide physical test standards, instrument calibration and method improvement, in conjunction with the Product Standards Division. The organizational move allows us to apply rigorous analytical standards to physical methods in the same manner they are applied to chemical methods.

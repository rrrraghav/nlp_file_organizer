The sample of triethylene glycol (TEG) submitted was analyzed for its pyrolyzates and impurities as follows. A small amount of the sample was pyrolyzed at two temperatures (700°C and 200°C). The pyroly- zates were then analyzed by an on-line pyrolysis/GC/MS system. A 60-m DB-5 fused silica capillary column was used. The GC column temperature was held at 35°C for 5 minutes and then programmed to 280°C at 3°C/min. The pyrolyzates were identified and are listed with their relative percentages as below:

% Compound (700°C)
15.99 Acetaldehyde
0.05 1,3-Dioxolane
0.26 1,3-Dioxolane, 2-methyl-
0.10 1,4-Dioxane
0.16 Diethylene glycol
82.84 Triethylene glycol

Only a trace amount of 1,4-dioxane was detected at 200°C. Diethylene glycol and 1,4-dioxane were identified by comparing their mass spectra and retention times with standard chemicals (Aldrich Chemical Co.).

The triethylene glycol submitted was analyzed for impurities as follows. A small amount of the sample was analyzed by GC/MS. A 60-m OW-351 fused silica capillary column was used. The temperature of the GC column was held at 35°C for 5 minutes and then programmed to 220°C at 3°C/min. Only approximately 0.078% of diethylene glycol relative to triethylene glycol was found.

Dear Dr Hickey,

Thank you for your letter and your publications on hormesis - it really seems to me to be a topic that raises quite a bit of interest. Your question about caffeine or nicotine is low levels to me because both seem to stimulate physiological processes at low levels. I did begin one draft of my paper with the assertion that most people are familiar with the hormetic effects of caffeine, nicotine and ethanol, but somehow it seemed a little trite!
I felt that to remain credible I ought to keep the examples I gave close to my own field of interest, so the review and my other papers on hormesis deal only with growth. I have not yet found examples in the literature of growth hormesis with caffeine or nicotine.

In recent months we have been trying to see whether the explanations for growth hormesis in hydroids (report enclosed) applies to other organisms.
I have suggested that hormesis is due to regulatory over-corrections of a rate-sensitive feedback mechanism that controls growth in hydroids. We have been seeking evidence for a similar explanation in a marine input and have shown that it oscillates in the same suggestive way, but the experiments thus far extent of the growth stimulation is not statistically significant.

Please keep me informed of your own progress with hormesis.

With best wishes.

Yours sincerely,



A R D Strebbing

Dear Harry:

The attached release is quite significant and I hope you will give it some attention. This is the first time anyone has had the courage to criticize the report of the nursing commission study.

Of course, the criticism comes from one side of the fence that seems to be getting a lot of heat. There are, as you know, a lot of RNs in California and the report does affect them in the long run.

Mrs. Martin is quite a gal – attractive, bright, well-spoken, personable. And very dedicated. She’s an RN, the wife of a physician and the mother of four.

If it's at all possible, I hope you will see the importance of this story and try to sit down with her while she’s in Los Angeles. She’ll be checking into the International Hotel the night of Oct. 21st and will be there all the next two days.

At any rate, I hope you and the family are well. My best to you and the lovely wife.

With kindest regards.

Sincerely,

Leonard S. Zaba

Dear Dr. Gardner:

Following our discussion in New Haven, I reviewed my twin populations born between 1897 and 1952. Our records show that there were 7,659 pairs of like-sexed twins born in this period who survived to one year of age. Studies we have conducted in the past would lead me to say that we should be able to locate approximately 60% or better of this population with both members alive and living in Connecticut. This certainly is more than the minimum number of pairs we discussed.

I have requested permission to attend the meeting in Miami Beach the week of December 10 and have made reservations for arriving on the 9th. I hope you will make reservations for me. I anticipate approval of my request and hope to see you shortly.

Sincerely yours,

Melt

RE: DORAL Ultra Light Box King and 100's

Dear Dale,

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is pleased to announce the availability of DORAL Ultras in new box styles. The tremendous growth in all Style products, a current 8% growth in ultra light products and DORAL’s strong position make this new product a perfect fit.

Attached is a fact sheet regarding these two new styles. We will be offering an introductory allowance of $7.50 per GM case on all product shipped from April 12 - May 7, 1999. Credit worthy customers will receive additional dating in your original allocations.

We have included a summary of your initial allocations. Please return the attached form with P.O. to our office by March 31, 1999. This will insure that you have this new product available to your customers. Our Sales Representatives are currently pre-selling this product and we will forward orders to you the first week of April 1999.

We have also included a sample of the DORAL Ultra Light 100’s BOX to assist with getting this product up in your system. Please call if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Chase Brent

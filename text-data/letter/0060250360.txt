Dear Mr. Hamner:

A friend of mine who is a practicing physician here told me of an interesting incident yesterday.

It seems that a well-known doctor here has been making experiments in the field of allergy. One of his experiments was to take a quantity of tobacco from Chesterfield cigarettes, place it on his arm, fasten it to his arm by means of adhesive plaster and leave it on the arm overnight. It appears that by the next morning the arm was swollen to twice its normal size.

Of course, I know that allergy is most often a matter of individual reaction and it is quite possible that some people might have a definite allergy to Chester-field tobacco others to Camel tobacco, perhaps others to LUCKY STRIKE tobacco; or it may even be possible that this doctor’s experiment would have the same result no matter what tobacco he had applied to his arm.

But, is it possible, perhaps, that there may be something in our process – the removal of irritants – which might make a normal individual less allergic to LUCKY STRIKE tobacco than to others? I wonder whether this particular experience opens a trail of thought for experimentation.

I would appreciate your thinking about it and letting me know your reactions.

Sincerely yours,

Paul M. Hahn
VICE-PRESIDENT

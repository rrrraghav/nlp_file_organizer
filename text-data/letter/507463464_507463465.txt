The CAMEL Brand is focusing on unique media and promotion opportunities in
1991.

Per Brand direction for 1991, unique, unexpected, attention-grabbing media and
promotion programs are desired. Inserts, advertorials, BBP speciality units
and especially vertaculars fall in this category.

The CAMEL Brand is appeal to appeal to smokers with an irreverent, offbeat
mindset.

What can I say? The vertacular is not a traditional, conservative,
mass-produced approach to OOH.

Vertaculars act as interrupters and attention getters.

It’s a well-researched fact that print inserts such as Smooth Magazine command
greater awareness and recall than standard page and spread executions.
Inserts establish big brand presence and provide needed variety to a print
schedule. They "shock" the reader who expects standard advertising and force
him to pay attention to the message.

Vertaculars serve a similar function for the OOH medium. People who are used
to viewing standard OOH units see and remember this special creative.
There is no formal research to back this but time-after-time in focus groups
participants say they’ve seen Miliband man cutouts.

Production costs for the unit are not OOH expensive.

Any time something beyond a standard OOH unit is produced, production costs
will be high. If you will note from the attached sheet, CAMEL vertacular
production costs are in line with similar special OOH creative such as the
MAGNA spangle board and vertical wall. As information, the marvelous
vertaculars in Detroit and Los Angeles aired 2-4 times more than at the CAMEL
festival.

Sincerely,

Ned Leary

P.S. I’ve attached a sheet outlining vertacular production costs.

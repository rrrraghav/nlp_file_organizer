Dear Bill:

As we discussed on the phone, I have arranged to send to you at South Windsor one hogshead of blended tobacco for reconstitution via the process you described to Mr. Resnik. This sample and any correspondence or discussion is to be on a non-confidential basis.

When preparing the sample, please add 2% glycerine based on tobacco (dry weight basis). As I understand it, you will return the sample in the hogshead or other suitable container, weighing about 1000 lbs. During the production of this sample, I would appreciate your arranging to have collected:

(1) 50 - 17" x 15" sheet samples for physical testing. The 17" dimension should be in the machine direction. These samples should be pulled at five intervals (10 sheets per sampling) equally spaced through the run. Please record time of sampling and pack each sample separately. These sheet samples should be packed in a way that will ensure no damage or drying out during return shipment.

(2) A 20-lb. sample of squares pulled throughout the run.

As you know, the tobacco sample may segregate during shipment so be sure to reblend. The return sample should be sent to:

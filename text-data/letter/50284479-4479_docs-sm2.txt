Dear Dr. Robinson: Re: Case #2037

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a proposed research study has now been considered by the members of the Scientific Advisory Board.

They asked me to notify you that they cannot encourage formal application for support of this study at the present time.

We trust that you will obtain the support you seek elsewhere.

Sincerely yours,
Harmon C. McAllister

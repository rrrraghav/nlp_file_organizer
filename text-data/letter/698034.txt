Dear Sirs:

I am very interested in racing. I’ve wanted to build my own Formula 1
Race Car but could not locate a set of plans. Maybe you could help.
I've already built a street car from the ground up. I really want to build
a Formula 1 Racer. I’m sure I can build the engine. What I primrerally need
is the complete body plans including: Degree of bends, Major stress points,
Minor stress points, Gear and gear ratios of differential and trans parts
list, etc., Complete blue prints, as much information as you can possibly
supply. I’ve seen your ad for the sale of the used car and I feel you can
help me.

Please send me any and all information you can supply. I am including my
phone number in case you want to contact me.

Sincerely,
Robert Kasatis

PHONE Area Code 201-291-2474

P.S. I don’t smoke Viceroy cigarettes but I do smoke Raleigh Filters, also*
a Brown and William product.

Dear Alan:

Further on the matter of your pending visit, I would like to suggest that you correspond directly with those you are interested in seeing, other than the members of our staff. To assist you I am enclosing a list of current addresses.

The reason for this suggestion is a bit complicated. For one thing Charlie and Marvin have both retired from The Institute. In addition, three of our companies have incorporated a new organization, the Center for Indoor Air Research, to look after the scientific matters related to the ETS controversy and to monitor and sponsor relevant research. While no formal arrangements have yet been made I suspect that CIAR will be taking over consultations with more or less the same persons with whom you would like to visit.

The acting Executive Director of the CIAR is Dr. Guy Cudaker at Reynolds. For that reason, and because of your expressed interest in visiting the R&R research facility I have included Guy’s address on the attached list.

Regarding your visit to The Institute, let me know when you can of the “hole” in your schedule so that I can arrange time for a couple of us to meet with you.

I hope you will find this satisfactory. We certainly look forward to seeing you.

Cordially,

William Kleopfer, Jr.

Dear Dr. Malkin:

The scientific staff of the Council for Tobacco Research has asked that I communicate to you their regrets in not being able to recommend support for your projects "Photoacoustic Investigations of photosynthetic activity of Tobacco leaves".

Over the years, this organization has supported research projects almost exclusively concerned with the etiology and pathogenesis of somatic diseases that have implied linkage to smoking as revealed by epidemiological associations. Be-cause of the continuing importance of these diseases in the national public health picture, the Council up to this time has been reluctant to divert its very limited resources away from such studies. I hope you can secure funding for your interesting project elsewhere.

Sincerely,

Harmon McAllister

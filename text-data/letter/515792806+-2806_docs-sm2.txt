INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
Winston-Salem, NC 27102

RJR

July 22, 1980

TO: Mr. E. A. Morrigan, Jr.

FROM: G. H. Long

SUBJECT: MDD Report on Teenage Smokers (14-17)

Attached is a MDD report covering the aforementioned subject.
Last January, a report was issued on this subject that indicated
that Philip Morris had a total share of 59 among 14-17 year old
smokers, and specifically, Marlboro had a 52 share. This latest
report indicates that Philip Morris’ corporate share has increased
by about 4 points; however, Marlboro remains the same at 52.

Importantly, the report further indicates that RJR continues to
gradually decline, and between the spring and fall 1979 periods,
RJR's total share declined from 21.3 to 19.9.

Hopefully, our various planned activities that will be implemented
this fall will aid in some way in reducing or correcting these
trends.

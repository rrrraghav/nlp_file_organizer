preemption and taxation.

Local restrictions as they relate to the following classes of trade; convenience store, supermarket, gas
station, wholesale and vending industry.

Our meeting will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 noon on Thursday, January 26, and will last to
approximately 2:30 p.m., and will be held at the Newark Airport Marriott Hotel. The hotel address and

Karl and I look forward meeting with you for this important meeting to share information and ideas to
meet the growing threat of punitive legislation as it relates to our business in 1995.

Once again, thank you for your interest in participating and we will be looking forward to seeing you on
the twenty-sixth of January.

Sincerely,

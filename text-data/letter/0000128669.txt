MS. VIVIAN T. MARRA
BATES

Dear Vivian:

I am returning Call Report V78-8 for a revision. Before discussing the revision, I believe we should clarify operating policy with respect to what materials Bates should provide B&W for VICEROY outdoor.

My understanding from Mike McCue, based on a meeting between the Brand Group, Bates and ZML, is that Bates will provide art and a layout with a cell overlay containing set type. The purpose of this material is to indicate type size, style, and placement.

Apparently, there was some confusion resulting from this meeting because in the case of "Pie," Bates provided a mechanical for 30-sheet but a layout with a type cell overlay for paint. In the future, it should provide the latter for both 30-sheet and paint.

As to the Call Report in question, therefore, the material provided for “Pie Throwing” V-PA-78-1 should read layout with type cell overlay (paint) Kings.

Would you please arrange to have the Call Report revised accordingly.

Sincerely,

Carter Broach

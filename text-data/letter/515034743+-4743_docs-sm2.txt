MEMORANDUM TO THE COMMITTEE OF COUNSEL

There is enclosed a copy of a recent decision by
Judge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
one of the prisoners' rights cases that we have been monitoring.

As you will see, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district
court’s dismissal of the nonsmoking prisoner’s Eighth Amendment
claims concerning smoking.

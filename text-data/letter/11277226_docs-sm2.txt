Dear Howard:

Many thanks for your letter of 30 August. I have been so busy of late that I have neglected writing my very best friends, most trusted associates and loyal Beardians. Like the prophet, Abdullah, you head the list.

One filing about sixty days ago was made with the Federal Food and Drug Administration. This consisted of about nineteen pages and could be considered a memorandum of information. Notice has been received that this filing is incomplete. I have prepared another filing that will amount to almost 400 pages, and I trust that this filing will be considered complete. The statutory limit for notification on a filing is sixty days, as you know; however, in some cases notification is given earlier than this.

You can advise your physician friends that a new drug application of almost 400 pages has been made to the Federal Food and Drug Administration and that a similar filing will be made with the corresponding California agency within the next few days.

I want to thank you for your intense and continuing efforts in the cause of Beardianism. I appreciate very much what you say about the pressure you are receiving from doctors, since we are feeling a bit of this ourselves.

As I may have told you, Doctor M. W. McDougall of 529 East 10th Street, Long Beach, California, is working on the Beard Anthrone Test. Perhaps you would like to drop him a line to welcome him to the club.

Cordially yours,

E.T. Krebs, Jr.

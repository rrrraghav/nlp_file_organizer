Dear John:

It was great to talk to you today, and I hope your move from Colorado goes smoothly. I know you will love living in the Commonwealth.

Per our conversation, we are preparing our year-end financial report and would greatly appreciate a $1,000 contribution from your group before January 1. I realize this is less than two weeks away, but I hope you can help.

I hope you and your family have a great holiday season, and if you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 804-359-1997.

Sincerely,

Tom Benedetti
Finance Director

Dear Harry:

Thank you for the various items of information that you have sent me recently.
I was sorry to miss you in Bloomington, but the M.D.P. in Cnelwood was interesting, and the contacts will be beneficial to getting things done.

I write to let you know that I am coming to Europe later this month. I will be accompanied by Joe Hough who is the ex-Liggetts man working for Bill Telling on KENT. On September 27, we go with Mike Hamerton to Woking to discuss KENT in the UK. On the Friday, John Howley and I will be presenting to Mr. Sheehy on the new KENT advertising and improved packaging.

We will be at BWIT’s offices in Brussels on October 1, at H. V. L. Luxembourg on October 2 and 3, and visit BAT Suisse in Geneva October 4 and 5. The latter visit and development plan which will result from the discussions should be very interesting. KENT is unsuccessful in Switzerland at the moment.

I am glad Claude Borloz has taken over the marketing responsibility as I respect him. I don’t know March, the Research Manager, and have mixed reports about him. I haven't been to Geneva for about four years but with Mr. Macadam visiting the company during the same week, mine will be a flying visit.

Germany is the subject of a letter John Howley is writing to you. Depending on Phil Wright’s findings and John Howley’s own trip in late October, I may well need to visit Hamburg with you (or invite the Germans to Millbank or Louisville) in late Autumn and work with them to implement decisions on the KENT family made at a higher level than mine. As you are BWIT's local contact point with BAT Germany, perhaps you would let me know what you think once we all know what they are proposing.

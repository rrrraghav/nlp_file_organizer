Re: Literature Retrieval Project

Gentlemen:

In your letter to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, American
Brands, Inc., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., Philip
Morris Incorporated and Liggett & Myers Incorporated,
dated February 8, 1971, you indicated that you were
holding certain items pertaining to the above project.

We understand that you were then holding said items in
accordance with a certain letter agreement between you
and the aforementioned companies, dated November 19, 1966.

We also understand that some of these items may have already
been delivered by you to The Council for Tobacco Research -
U.S.A., Inc. and that others of these items may still be
in your possession.

Would you please deliver any such items still in your
possession to The Council. Would you also please convey
to The Council any and all rights, title and interest,
which you may have either in said items or in any data,
concepts or other matters relating to this project, as
well as any of the items, data, concepts or other
matters relating to this project previously delivered
to The Council.

Thank you very much for your trouble.

Sincerely,

A.H.
Alexander Holtzman

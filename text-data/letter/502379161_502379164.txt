MEMORANDUM ON CIGARETTE ADVERTISING

1. INTRODUCTION

Much thought is currently being given to restrict advert-
ising for certain products and the category which at present
is under discussion is that of tobacco products and more
particularly cigarettes.

The EAAA is of the opinion that as long as governments
permit the sale of cigarettes, they cannot deny
the manufacturer the right to inform the public about
the products they sell.

The EAAA is not qualified to comment on current theories
about risks to the health of the person who smokes.
However, it would like to give its views on the role of
advertising in the marketing of tobacco which
is under discussion at the moment.

2. Does advertising promote smoking?

There is no evidence one way or the other, about the effects
of advertising on individual persons but there is ample
evidence from overall statistics to show that the absence of
advertising does not reduce the overall volume of smoking
in any country. In Italy, for example, where advertising has
been banned for 13 years, cigarette consumption shows a
steep increase in comparable countries, rising from 7.5
thousand million cigarettes in 1962 to 10.8 thousand millions
in 1977 (not counting the consumption of smuggled cigarettes)
and to 14.4 thousand millions in 1979.

In the Eastern Block countries where advertising has not
been allowed, though of smoking has risen steadily in
some cases, while in others it has fallen. (e.g.
Poland where it rose by 25% between 1970 and 1973).

The absence of television advertising in Austria, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, and
United Kingdom, France this without doubt the most power-
ful advertising medium, has not had any effect on the level
of smoking; it would be unreasonable to assume that the
withdrawal of the much less powerful media of press and
billboards would have more effect.

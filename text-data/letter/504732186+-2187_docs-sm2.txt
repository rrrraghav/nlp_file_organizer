Mr. J. D. Barnhill:

Weekly Highlights
Division 784

1) N&A Filter

A new smaller size gorniture has been ordered and is being air freighted
from England. Arrival is expected the week of January 22. Evaluation of
filters produced with the gorniture will begin as soon as possible.

2) HY Tow

The SALEM KS product with HY tow selected for NFO testing was rejected
due to low firmness results. Another sample is being taken and will be NFO
tested. Mailout will be delayed to the first of February.

3) Monsanto Filter

The equipment is being set up and sample filters will be made the week
of January 22 for KJITI testing. Application to cigarettes in Brazil is
planned.

4) WINSTON Lights, SALEM Lights, and CAMEL Lights Box Products

Prototypes with correct tar and nicotine values have been prepared. Repeat
tests to obtain enough product for panel evaluations and more extensive physical
and chemical analyses are underway. The work is currently on schedule or
slightly ahead of schedule.

5) Multidraft Unit

The instrument was moved to 97-1 and made operational for use in monitoring
VANTAGE 9 production. Initial results using air dilution percent measured by the
unit to predict tar and nicotine on production product were good. This has been
done more or less as a “shake down” exercise. We will attempt to have the unit
available for the CAMEL Light 100 startup on January 29.

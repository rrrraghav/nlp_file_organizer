Dear Mr. Routien:

Although some time has passed I do want to acknowledge
and thank you for your letter of June 5th on turkey “X” disease.

I have discussed this matter with scientists of the
National Cancer Institute in Washington. They have an intensive
study under way on this problem and we will keep in close touch
with them. At the appropriate points we will consider sending a
hand if it appears necessary in order to cover fully any angle
that might be relevant to tobacco.

I would appreciate having a Xerox copy of the publication
by the Interdepartmental Working Party on Ground Nut Toxicity Re-
search, which I have not yet acquired.

We will endeavor to keep you posted on any developments.

Sincerely yours,

Robert C. Hockett, Ph.D.
Associate Scientific Director

Dear Ron:

This is in response to your letter of October 13 asking for Reynolds to assist you as you plan to participate in the World Cup and the U.S. Ski Team. Unfortunately, I must advise you, Ron, that we do not sponsor individuals in such events and, therefore, I am afraid that we cannot be of any assistance to you. However, I was very pleased to hear from you again and I am also very impressed with the goals that you have set for yourself. Please give my best to your Mom and Dad.

Warm regards.

Sincerely,

E. A. Horrigan, Jr.

Dear Dr. Fink:

The d,l-norcotine (0.49 g, my Sample Number: 6668-111-74-3) which is being supplied to you has a minimum purity by gas chromatography of 95 percent. The sample has been stored under a nitrogen atmosphere as it undergoes slow oxidation on long-term exposure to air. The rate of oxidation is not as rapid as that of nicotine. For long-term storage, we also keep the compound in the dark to avoid the possibility of photodegradation. The method of preparation of the d,l-norcotine is as yet unreported but is currently being written up for publication: W. B. Edwards, III, D. F. Glenn, F. Greene and R. H. Newman, in preparation.

If there is any additional information you need regarding this material, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Sincerely yours,

William B. Edwards

MEMORANDUM

TO: The Members of the Management Committee

FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.

Enclosed for your review prior to our conference call November 16
are The Institute staff’s recommendations for 1993 creative and
media buys for the “Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No” and “It’s the
Law” print campaigns. These materials include a narrative
describing the rationale for the proposed insertion schedule, the
new creative work, and the budget. By way of summary:

materials; Helping Youth Say No

Three different creative concepts are included in the 1993
“Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No” print advertising package
(Tab II).

The first, “It’s Tough Growing Up,” complements the print
messages for 1991 and 1992, and continues to dovetail the themes
stressed by the television PSAs. This ad has been designed for
placement in general consumer books and minority publications, at
a budget totaling $694,000 for general consumer (down $256,000
from 1992) and $55,000 for minority media (down $10,000).

A second ad, “Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up,” has
been designed for decision maker publications and continues to
promote both the youth and “It’s the Law” components of the
industry's youth initiatives. The 1993 budget for decision maker
publications is at $291,000 (up $66,000 from 1992).

The third ad, also headlined “Smoking Should Not Be A Part of
Growing Up,” is designed for the education trade press and is
same ad that began running midway through 1992. Because the
educator audience is the peer group of the family COUNSEL
Consortium members, the Consortium is designated as the sponsor
of this ad, made possible by a grant from the Institute. This
sponsorship again dovetails the designation carried by the PSAs.
A full-year schedule for the education press is budgeted at
$25,000 (a $5,000 increase).

Dear Professor Sterling:

Thank you for your letter of April 2, 1982, with its interim report, financial accounting and proposal for the continuation of the "Project on Computer Analysis of Related Data".

We are pleased to confirm that the sum of $52,950.00 you require for the first year of the project to begin on April 1, 1982 will be provided to Simon Fraser University in two equal installments of $26,475.00 payable May 1, 1982 and November 1, 1982. It is understood that a complete accounting of these funds will be made as of March 31, 1983, and any unexpended funds returned.

We note that the study contemplates a duration of two years; therefore, consideration will be given to support for one additional year as budgeted following a review of progress before the end of the first year.

Our records will again designate your undertaking as a Special Project of the Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc. rather than a grant-in-aid. It should be noted that this designation should be so worded to avoid its being confused with the grant programs of the Scientific Advisory Board.

We are pleased to assist you in this investigation and are confident that it will yield data of scientific value.

Sincerely,

W. T. Hoyt

Dear Ron:

Thanks for meeting with us last week to discuss our questions about Lorillard’s proposed fall advertising campaign. Because this subject is of such concern to us, I thought it best to summarize in writing some of the questions we raised.

The recent California and FTC attacks on the Joe Camel advertising campaign are alarming and compel us to be sure that our Property will not be used to recruit underage smokers, intentionally or otherwise. These developments raise new moral and legal issues for us as we see Harley-Davidson and its broad range of products attracting an ever more youthful audience. Forecasting how children will react to massive publicity about a Harley-Davidson cigarette is complex, and selling the new cigarette at a discount price would increase its affordability to children, which could be an enticement even without the accompanying “low price” slogans.

Some time ago, we expressed concern about positioning Harley-Davidson cigarettes in a way that says, in effect, "buy Harley-Davidson cigarettes because they’re cheap." Kathleen Demitros made that point in writing over two and a half years ago. While we accommodated Lorillard's desire to test such slogans in limited test markets in order to gather data about price points, we have never agreed to a full-scale rollout on such a basis. A massive cigarette advertising campaign like yours could redefine the Harley-Davidson image in a way that conflicts with the brand image we have worked so hard to create and sustain.

Dear Alex:

In accordance with your earlier request, I am enclosing
herewith xerox copies of most of the illustrations and charts
used during the site visit presentation at Harvard. I hope that
these will serve your purpose in being able to report about the
site visit to those in Philip Morris who were not able to attend
and who have a desire to know.

With best regards.

Sincerely,



David R. Hardy

Dear Mr. Pinney:

Thank you for your invitation to participate in the
"Working Meeting: Research Needs on Low-Yield Cigarettes".

The following are some of the questions which I believe
bear examination in future research on the effects of cigarette
smoking on the pregnant mother, the fetus and placenta, and the
child. As you will note many are those I formulated for the
chapter on Pregnancy and Infant Health for the 1979 Surgeon
General’s Report on Smoking and Health. (I apologize for the
sketchy nature of some of these questions, but I am writing
this letter during a few hours between a trip to Boston and
another to Amsterdam.)

Lactation and Breast Feeding

1. By what mechanism does nicotine affect prolactin
release, and can this phenomenon be reversed?

2. To what extent is nicotine excreted in breast
milk ingested by the nursing infant?

3. What other components of cigarette smoke are
secreted in significant amounts in breast milk?

4. Do interactions between nicotine and other drugs
such as benzo[a]pyrene excreted in breast milk
affect newborn physiology?

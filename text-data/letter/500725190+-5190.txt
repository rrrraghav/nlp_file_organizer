Dear Thom:

Re: Disposition of CAMEL Art and Plate Files

This will recap the agreement reached at our 5/29 meeting
re. the disposition of art and plates.

1. Advertising art and plate materials will be held on file
for three years from date of first national use and
then destroyed.

2. Collateral art and plate materials (POS, etc.) will
be held on file for two years from date of first
national use and then destroyed.

3. Exceptions will be considered for advertising materials
on an as needed basis. The Agency will recommend
exceptions when they feel any particular piece of
advertising has a useful life that exceeds three years,
particularly in the case of CAMEL REGULAR where the
current pool is limited.

In addition, the Agency will continue to maintain a permanent
file of examples of all advertising and promotional material
produced for the Brands.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to call.

Sincerely,

Craig C. Standen

Dear Suzanne:

Subject: PRODUCT TESTS SCREENING

I am attaching copies of the demographic design for tests
currently scheduled. Please notice that unless I have speci-
fied the percent of smokers by brand in category selection,
the normal rate of distribution is to be applied; i.e.,
77-0037 is specified, 77-1487-1488 will reflect normal dis-
tribution.

Also attached are copies of various ways of looking at dis-
tribution of smokers that should be helpful to you.

If you have questions, please call.

Sincerely,

Ray

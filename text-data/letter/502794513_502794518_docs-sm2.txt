A. ANALYSIS OF TOBACCO SMOKE

1. Determination of Polycyclic Hydrocarbons by Phosphometry

Cigarettes containing the additives listed in Table 1, along with a control, were smoked on the analytical smoking machine. The smoke condensates obtained were analyzed spectrophotometrically for fluorene, benzo[b]fluorenhone and 3,4-benzpyrene. The values obtained are also listed in this table.

Control 15.40 1.28 2.16
Attapulgus clay, 3% 12.70 1.15 1.79
Calcium carbonate, 5% 11.58 1.15 1.70

B. DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICAL METHODS

1. Determination of Acids in Nonaqueous Solvents

a. Determination of Perchlorates

Additional perchlorates were assayed by the following procedure: Approximately 0.5 g. of sample was weighed into a 100-ml. volumetric flask and dissolved in 10 ml. of water. The solution was diluted to the mark with pyridine and 10 ml. aliquots were titrated potentiometrically with 0.1 N tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Bu4NOH).

The perchlorates of cobalt, aluminum, zinc, manganese, lead and strontium were successfully analyzed in this manner. Chromic acid must be added to the aliquot prior to the titration of acetonate

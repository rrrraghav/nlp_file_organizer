READYFLAKE

Dear Dr. Egli,

The Readyflake cigarettes you left with us last week have now been tested in our sensory irritation comparison test. They were asked to rank the cigarettes for irritation and flavour.

The majority confirmed that coating increased the “roughness” rating, with scores ranging between 380/71 and 420/71. One smoker, however, was of the opinion that coated Readyflake was less irritating than uncoated (360/71 vs 380/71) but preferred the latter as found an off-flavour for both coated samples.

It is, of course, a given list to make 100% reconstituted tobacco at present, and it would be difficult to achieve this without some degree of coated product. We will continue to investigate means to mask the taste side of the coating process. The cross-linking agent, used at 0.35% w/w, is proving to be particularly effective in reducing “roughness” all over the cigarette and we are currently exploring alternative agents. I feel that a more palatable approach would be to use a different type of binder not only to reduce irritation but also to give a better appearance in filling capacity.

With kind regards,

Yours sincerely,

P.J. Nicholl

PRI. RESEARCH REPORTS

Chris, the Brand has requested, on numerous occasions, that
Mr. John McMain at William referbe copied on all advertising
and sales promotional research done for WINN-DIXIE. The Agency has
received some of these reports, but apparently has not received
all of them. In the future, the Brand would appreciate your
copying Mr. McMain on all advance research reports at the same
time the report is released to the Brand.

The primary reason for this request is that the Agency can be
most helpful in providing additional input to the Brand as re-
gards these programs and their effectiveness. In
addition, this information is most useful to the Agency, both
as information and for planning purposes.

Also, please copy Mr. McMain on all consecutive "Free Rides"
that apply specifically to WINN-DIXIE (i.e., Marlboro, Viceroy,
B & G, L & M, etc.).

Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

P. R. Ray, Jr.

SUBJECT: Kelgraf-1200 Chain Oil Replacement

FROM: Paul Barr

Tobacco samples collected from under the Tobaccoville C&D dry apron,
were analyzed by RAD, revealed the presence of the chemical
2-butoxyethanol. Information on the Kelgraf-1200 oil
indicated the presence of .5% glycol ethers that are added for chain
cleaning. Scientific Affairs has stated that "use of this oil in
areas where it can come into direct contact with tobacco is likely
to contaminate tobacco indirectly should be discontinued."

Ms. Carolyn Rahn contacted Witco Co, and discussed alternative chain
oils. They have available a chain oil of the same viscosity and
operating temperature which does not contain the chain cleaning
chemical package. Scientific Affairs is evaluating this oil.
Discussion with the affected area personnel has identified that (1)
the installation of an automatic hot water wash on the dryers and
the scheduled pressure washing of the feeder chains greatly reduces
the need for the chain cleaner package and (2) that the investigation
objective should be to eliminate the problem rather than initiate
administrative controls.

Witco Co. is sending me 3-1/2 gallon sample of the 100 AR chain
lubricant to test. Since GU NI has the wash system installed on
their dryers, I would propose that the testing be conducted at that plant.
The two (2) parameters that can be monitored for comparison are:
1. Quantity of oil.
2. Amperage consumption.

Russ Dockman and I will get with Foy Hicks to set up a dryer test that
will develop replacement oil recommendation to present to the
Primary MIC Committee.

Thanks for your time.

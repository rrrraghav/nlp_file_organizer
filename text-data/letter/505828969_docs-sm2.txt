Dear Dr. Sivak:

Enclosed find a copy of a protocol entitled "Repeated Exposure Study with Cigarette Smoke in the Rat". We would appreciate receiving a cost estimate as soon as possible. As Sam Simmons indicated to you, we anticipate a November 25, 1985 initiation date for this study.

In addition to a cost estimate, our pathologist would appreciate receiving a copy of several ADL SOP's. Gary Burger would like to see your SOP for lung perfusion and your SOP for lung fixation and sectioning. Also, Dr. Burger requires additional information regarding fixation and sectioning of nasal sections. In particular, he is interested in your SOP for decalcification of the nasal turbinates and the location from which the four sections are taken. Please note on page 7 of the protocol the requirement for the presence of a board-certified pathologist at all scheduled and unscheduled necropsies. Please confirm that ADL can comply with this.

If any questions arise regarding this protocol, feel free to call Sam Simmons at (919) 773-5545 or me at (919) 772-5045.

Sincerely,

Randy Deskin, Ph.D.

Mr. Larry Dulude
Market Research Manager
200 East 42 Street
New York, NY

Dear Mr. Dulude:

I am very pleased to be able to report to you that our panel is now complete, with about 1,500 female heads of households and some 1,200 males represented. As you know, we queried our panel concerning its purchase and use of some 240 different product categories, including cigarettes, in which you expressed interest.

Our panels show the following usage of cigarettes and related products:

Females Males
Cigarlillos 0.9 7.0
Cigarette Size 1.7 4.7
Cigars 41.9 45.4



While brands used and frequency of use have been included in the questionnaire, they are tabbed only on order, or for specific projects.

As you know, Mr. Dulude, our panel is not a national one with respondents scattered over 50 states. We maintain a local panel at two metropolitan New York locations (Little Neck, Queens and Huntington, L.I.), and our members can be made to literally turn on a dime. Thus if you required 500 cigarette smokers next Tuesday for a taste test, we can do so, and since we have already pre-screened our members their screening costs are reduced to near zero.

I would very much like to participate with you in your 1977 research plans and to demonstrate to you how our unique service can be of use to you. If you like, I would be more than pleased to provide you and your associates with a personal presentation of our capabilities. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

In the meantime, have a very happy and healthy New Year.



   Iry truly yours,
Larry Zame
Director Market Research

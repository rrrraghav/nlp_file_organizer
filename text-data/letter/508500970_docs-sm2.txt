Dear Dr. Leake,

Thank you for sending me the interesting results from your evaluation of 3M’s Expantrol V infusencent granules. While this results do not initially appear encouraging, at least they offer possible directions for improvement. Some ideas immediately came to mind:

Change the particle size to optimize adherence. We have recently determined that smaller particles give better adherence.

Restrict use of the additive to only filter cigarettes to eliminate the grit problem. Our results also show some filters work better than others in preventing particle migration.

Bond the particles to a percentage of the tobacco in “secondary” casing operation using a water solution.

3M will be meeting with our tobacco consultant, Mr. Robert Cumifft, in early February to explore additional "new" approaches to possibly incorporating Expantrol V into cigarettes. We would appreciate continuing our discussions with American Tobacco and thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

Alan J. Marlof
Product Development Manager

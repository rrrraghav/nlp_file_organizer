The effect of these agents upon the flow of blood in the various human tissues has been considered to be a problem deserving high priority, and these have taken precedences over any animal work.

The basic questions to be answered now, I would assume, are these: What facts of general applicability can be learned by study of blood flow in the manner touch that cannot be learned by direct study of human subjects? What are the actual advantages in terms of information to be gained or recording the blood vessel activity on moving picture film? Is the cost of such work likely to be justified by what can be learned about the effects of tobacco constituents?

The financial request made last year was far greater than the average appropriation that has been made for research projects and could not be given a commensurate degree of priority.

Since the photographic equipment is already available, I am wondering what “instrument development” may be referred to in your letter of June 9. Whole composite cigarette smoke condensate can be

INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: ANALYSIS OF :30 AND :60 ON-AIR STUDIES Date: February 18, 1969

To: Mr. R. M. Odear, Jr.

BACKGROUND:

MRD has conducted on-air tests for various :30 and :60 commercials on our Company line products. Listed on the attached chart are overall recall scores on all of the Company line commercials (see Chart I). Only two CAMEL Regular commercials (“Main Coast” and “Jungle”) received on-air tests on both the :30 and :60 versions. Chart II compares four, not necessarily the same, :30 and :60 "Walk A Mile" commercials which have been on-air tested by MRD. The analysis compares the various recall scores of the four :30 versus 60 CAMEL Group commercials and the overall average for Company line products.

FINDINGS:

Listed below are significant findings from my :30 versus :60 analysis:

a) :60 Company line commercials cost twice as much as :30 commercials and deliver 19% more overall recall (see Chart I).

b) :60 "Walk A Mile" commercials deliver 17% more overall recall than :30’s (see Chart II).

c) :60 commercials deliver 25% more specific recall (see Chart III).

d) There is no substantial difference in the :30 versus :60 generally related recall scores (see Chart II).

e) There was no difference in the :30 versus :60 slogan recall scores (see Chart III).

f) There was no difference in the :30 versus :60 recall referencing the "Walk A Mile" format (see Chart II).

g) There was no difference in the :30 versus :60 playback of “hole in the man’s shoe” recall (see Chart II).

h) The percentage of men in the commercial audience giving recall was nearly the same in :60 and :30 commercials (see Chart III).

i) Recall from men under 35 was nearly the same in :60 and :30 commercials (see Chart II).

Dear Max:

Thank you for your letter of June 26 and the copies of reports by Klimisch and by Nilsson and Tibbling.

The chemical information up to the present is certainly not definitive when it comes to explaining the biological results. The more we know about the chemistry, the more difficult and confusing It seems to be. To develop this kind of a relationship will require a tremendous effort.

Many thanks for the help.
With best regards.

Sincerely,
H Wake

Mr. Mark Schofield
Brown & Williamson

Dear Mark,

This will provide you with the Agency’s view of point on RALEIGH Parent/
Family advertising role we discussed informally last week.

Conclusion:

We continue to believe that total brand sales and share will be optimized
by continuing to support RALEIGH Lights.  Parent or Family of Products advertising does not represent the best use of funds
for RALEIGH at current budget levels.

Rationale:

1. Ideally, we would advertise both RALEIGH Parent and RALEIGH Lights.
We see a clear field for Parent advertising, both primarily defensive.
First of all Parent advertising should slow the rate of Parent decline by
communicating to smokers that Parent is still around.  Secondly, it allows us
to steer current smokers’ preference to Lights. Secondly, Parents
advertising can be used to support the RALEIGH Lights product story
for the Light style by continuing to build brand heritage.

Five major, non-merchandised brands support then Parent styles – Marlboro, Winston,
Camel, Kent and Benson & Hedges.  RALEIGH is not as strong as these. To
hold Parent forces a limit (4%) . (4%) The other brands have had Parent
advertising for years, but not RALEIGH’s, despite RALEIGH's full
of direct Parent advertising (Exhibit 1).

Aggressive support of Lights style has resulted in net share gains for
Marlboro, Kent, Camel and Benson & Hedges.

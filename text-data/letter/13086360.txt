Dear Bruce,

Enclosed, please find six volumes of data concerning project 88-11K, the Kool Milds Perception/Advertising Elements Study.

Three volumes contain all the information collected on the questionnaire including field agency, demographics, MOB information, second MOB information, all the open ends and all the attributes (scale questions) utilizing a 1-10 scale. The open end scheme in these volumes follows the scheme we sent you in early March. Two of these volumes have the banners you requested (one demographic, one MOB information). The third is a reflection of which ad the respondent saw, also run by the entire questionnaire.

The second three volumes employ the same banners but only contain the open ends and the attributes utilizing a 1-100 scale. The open end scheme here reflects Henry Huber’s fax of March 6th.

We are presently working on resetting the open ends as per Henry Huber's request of March 10th. These should follow later this week.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Sincerely,



Kate Schueller
Study Director

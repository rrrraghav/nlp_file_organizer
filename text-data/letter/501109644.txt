Re: CAMEL FILTER HEADLINE TEST
MRD # 75-0707)

After Camel Filter had gone national with the “Meet The Turk”
campaign, various nationality groups expressed anti-Turkish
sentiments. To alleviate any possible negative reactions to
the “Meet The Turk” campaign, research was conducted to evaluate
five alternate headlines with "Meet The Turk" as a control.

1. One of A Kind
2. A Breed Apart
3. He Does More Than Exist...
4. A Man…His Cigarette
5. The Camel Filter Man
6. Meet The Turk

Of these headlines, two – “A Man…His Cigarette” and “The
Camel Filter Man” -- received low recall impact and did not
appear to communicate Camel Filter’s product benefits. Following
are the results of the three highest scoring headlines in comparison
to "Meet The Turk".

FINDINGS:

Immediate Recall

“One of A Kind” had the highest recall impact of the alternate
headlines. “Meet The Turk” scored very high in recall as would
be expected of a national campaign.

The One of Breed More Than
Turk A Kind Apart Exist

Correct Recall 51% 29% 22% 22%

Meaning of Headline

When asked about the meaning of the headline, respondents felt
that “One of A Kind” and “Breed Apart” were inferring both
product characteristics and life style attributes.

The One of Breed More Than
Turk A Kind Apart Exist

Cigarette characteristics 57% 81% 55% 9%
Life style attributes 35 29 51 79
Don’t know meaning 17 5 7 17

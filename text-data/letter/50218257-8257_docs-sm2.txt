Re: Grant Application No.  1273
Marte-Louise Luba, Ph.D.

Dear Dr. Feinshtein:



It has been suggested that you might evaluate for us a grant proposal we now have under consideration, for which we require a critical review. 

Because of the pressure of time, I have taken the liberty of enclosing a confidential copy of the application, and hope that you would evaluate it for us.  You have entire latitude on how you set down your comments. The Council provides a modest honorarium for such evaluations.



As we are now preparing for a semi-annual meeting of our Scientific Advisory Board, we trust that we may hear from you within the next few weeks at the latest.

If you are not able to provide the requested evaluation, please simply return the application in the enclosed postpaid envelope. 



Sincerely yours,



David Stone, Ph.D.
Associate Research Director

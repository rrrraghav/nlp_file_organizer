CONFIDENTIAL
MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION

Mr. Leonard Zahn

Great Neck, New York 11021

Dear Leonard:

Are you aware that AMA has agreed to an industry proposal
to turnover to C.T.R. the substantial funds left from the
ERF project? If not, consider it my fault, but no harm is
done.

Leo Brown is working now on publishing a final report including
abstracts. That will be the next big expense. In the fall
the turnover should occur.

Which brings me to the point and I am putting this in writing
so that you can tuck it into your future file: I think
there ought to be a photograph and news release at the time of
the transaction which, if Add is willing, you could perhaps
work up out with the Chicago boys.

Cordially,

William Kloepper, Jr.

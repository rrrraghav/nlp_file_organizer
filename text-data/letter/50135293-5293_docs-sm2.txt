Dear Dr. Lisanti:

Jack Frankel asked that I write to you with regard to two points
on the coefficient, Yule’s Q.

Q is a measure of association between two variables that have each
been classified into dichotomies. Thus it contrasts with the most
conventional measure of association, Pearson's Product-moment Corre-
lation (r), in that latter relates two variables that are each
measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both
measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing
perfect direct or inverse associations, respectively.

Pearson’s r is based on the product moments for each data point
represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted
sum of signed distance vectors from the bivariate mean. It therefore
requires interval scales measuring the variables.

In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points
on the scales. Only two points are represented for each variable
(e.g., high x low, x on off, cancer x non-cancer, etc.). The data
are thus classified into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack).

A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F.

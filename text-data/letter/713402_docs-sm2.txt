Dear Wyatt:

Ted, Gary, and I spent the day in Little Rock yesterday riding the Rich Lights’ showing and we were pleased to find that, with one exception, all the postings were in very good condition.

The one exception was a 30-sheet board posted at 7th and Park which was flagging and was also obscured by a tree. Due to the limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging problem.

There were also two locations that we could not find. One is indicated on the map as a new location at U.S. 67 and 167 near the Little Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on the map at the junction of U.S. 70 and 130. The only 30-sheet locations near the latter point were Borden and Camel Lights. Could you please advise the status of these two locations.

Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30-sheet location located inbound on Highway 167 one mile west of the Dixie exit which was virtually falling apart (the physical structure and the paper). The structure had Baird on it, not Donrey. The location is very good; however, we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising value is worthless and, in its present condition, is probably detrimental. Could you please check this out for us.

Wyatt, our net impression is that, given that the Little Rock plant is pretty average to start with, Rich Lights now looks better, as far as posting conditions go, than any other showing in the market.

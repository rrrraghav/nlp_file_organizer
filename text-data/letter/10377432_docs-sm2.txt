Dear Dr. Hockett:

I have received your letter of April 22 and the form for
application for a research grant. These forms will be completed
and returned by May 15.

I am preparing a progress report on the results to date
under the 1957 and 1958 grants. This report will be included
with the application forms. Progress Report No. 2, dated April
1, 1958, was reported under TIRC Grant No. 152. Is this still
the number of the TIRC grant? I would appreciate receiving this
information at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

C. B. McCants
Associate Professor

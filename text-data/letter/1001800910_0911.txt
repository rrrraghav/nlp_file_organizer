Dear Andy:

The book on Free Radicals which I referred yesterday was
written by W. N. Hinsberg and is a rather comprehensive spectrum-koncept-theoretische-chemie of oxidation. I am certain that you
will find it to be quite valuable and instructive. It is here that he compiles the existing literature on
oxidation-reduction enzyme systems, photo synthesis, and to carcinona.
I also believe that you will find his discussion of the studies on
detecting free radicals in cigarette smoke.

To my mind this whole subject of free radicals and their rela-
tionship to enzyme mechanisms is a rather fascinating area of
chemistry at present. If one can speak of geometric lines in science,
then I would say that we are approaching an important juncture in
biology over the domain of free radicals. Unfortunately, this
is not something that chemists should be able to supply, but in
part the area that chemists should be able to supply.

The more I think of these relationships between resonating
polymers and free radical reactions, the more it seems that one way
through contradiction, the more other ways. It must be reason for radicals
to exist. If one would find the largest concentration of stable free radicals
in a system, then one could determine what is going on. It is thought that the higher polymers would tend to be disproportionate and be
responsible for some of the color changes observed in tobacco. In this
think the problems of supernatant and filtration prove lower cancer
concentrations.

Sincerely,
A. W. Stewart

Dear Peter,



R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company would like to extend our current merchandising agreement with Canal Bayou Food with the following changes:

* No changes in merchandising (positioning of package fixtures).

* Must allow R.J. Reynolds to prorate at parity pricing in all price tiers. 12/1/95

* To remain in effect for al of 1995.



In consideration for extending our current merchandising agreement with the above listed changes, RLR will pay Canal Bayou Foods $3,000.00 front. Canal Bayou Foods understands that:

* If this contract extension is terminated by Canal Bayou Foods prior to 75% of the term (6 months) being satisfied, Canal Bayou Foods will refund 100% of the extension bonus payment. If this contract extension is terminated by Reynolds during the final 26% of the term (3 months), Canal will refund the pro rated amount of the extension bonus payment not earned.

* If legislation is enacted that requires RLR’s ability to satisfy the entire term of this agreement, and monthly payment could cease at that time, however, Canal Bayou Foods would not be obligated to return unearned extension bonus money to RLR.

* RLR can elect to terminate this agreement anytime. In such an event, Canal Bayou Foods will be entitled to retain the upfront payment.



Should Canal Bayou Foods agree to the stipulations set forth in this document, please complete the information at the bottom of this page and return to us.



Sincerely,

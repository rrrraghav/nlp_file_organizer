Brown & Williamson

Brown & Williamson is using a mail insert coupon on Viceroy offering consumers $2 off with purchase of two cartons (see attached).

We received a brochure showing Brown & Williamson floor package merchandisers (see attached, original on file).

Liggett & Myers

Liggett reportedly will introduce Eve Lights in either Phoenix or Denver. We have alerted Division Managers in these cities to report any developments on Eve Lights.

Lorillard

We continue to receive comments indicating that Lorillard will introduce a Kent III containing 3 mg. of tar.

Lorillard has dropped the name Kent on Golden Lights in three test markets. Each carton of Golden Lights now contains a notice indicating the change (see attached).

Philip Morris

Philip Morris will be promoting the entire Marlboro line during June this year. Attached is a copy of the 90-carton floor base they will be pushing. Source: G. H. Roberts, Springfield, Missouri, Division Manager.

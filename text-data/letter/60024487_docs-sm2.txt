Honourable Council:

Our group is interested in doing research about possible protective agents to prevent Parkinson’s disease development. Recently, we found a protective effect of one of the components of tobacco in the experimental model of Parkinson's disease in mice, the MTP model. We have sent an article with the results of this study to a scientific journal.
Now, we want to extend this observation to human patients with Parkinson’s disease and we would like to get financial support for such a project. Thus, we will be very pleased to receive some information about research grant applications or formats of your organization to support scientific projects.

Thanking in advance for your kind consideration, I remain,

Sincerely yours,

C.M. Rico

Re: Special Project #101

Dear Doctor Hickey:

We are in receipt of your proposal for a research project titled
"Epidemiological and Etiological Studies on the Relation of Air Pollution,
Smoking and Other Environmental Variables to Human Chronic Disease," which
was tendered under date of January 29, 1979 by Mr. E. J. Parker, Contracts
Administrator.

We are pleased to confirm that the $69,161.00 you requested will
be provided for the period January 1 through December 31, 1979. A check
covering payment for the first six months will be sent under separate cover
to Mr. Parker.

Our records will designate this undertaking as Special Project
of the Council for Tobacco Research - U.S., Inc. rather than a grant.
If credit line should be inserted into any future publications, please do
so worded.

We are pleased that it is possible to assist you in this investigation
and are confident it will yield data of scientific value.

Sincerely,

W. T. Hoyt
Executive Vice President

Parker

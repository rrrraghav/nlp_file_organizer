Dear Dr. Young:

Tobacco products have not been regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of their place historically in American society. However, if tobacco products were introduced today, they would certainly fall under the purview of FDA.

R. J. Reynolds has recently introduced a "smokeless" cigarette. This is a product which is substantially different from those traditionally considered as tobacco products:

1. It does not involve the burning or chewing of tobacco.

2. It is, essentially, a drug inhalant system, the drug being nicotine.

3. It contains unknown chemicals in a "flavor capsule" which may be harmful.

4. Tobacco is a secondary part of this product; it could be produced without the tobacco.

On the other hand, this product is substantially similar to delivery systems regulated by FDA, including nicotine gum, drug inhalant delivery systems (asthmatic and other products) and “Favor” and a "smokeless" cigarette.

It is in the public interest that this product receive the same scrutiny afforded to all new products, so as to protect the health of the American public.

This product is a cigarette substitute, and thus, has therapeutic use in smoking cessation/reduction. It is important that this product not be given an unfair advantage over other products and devices which have a similar use.

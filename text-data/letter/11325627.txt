Mr. William D. Hobbs, Chairman
Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc.
110 East 59th Street
New York, NY 10022

Dear Bill:

At the June 1984 annual meeting of the Burley
Auction Warehouse Association Board of Directors, I
withdrew my name for nomination as Chairman of the
Board. James Finch was elected Chairman and Ben Crane
President. Although I was named director emeritus and
consultant, I believe it best for me to resign as a
member of the Council for Tobacco Research and ask the
Burley Auction Warehouse Association Board to name my
replacement as a Class B member.

Having disposed of my tobacco auction warehouse
interests, I feel the above action is only proper.

It has been a pleasure and honor for me to serve
as a member of the Council since its inception. Please
convey to my fellow members my best wishes and gratitude
for the important contribution the officers, staff and
members have made to the industry. As President of Clay
Tobacco Company, I will continue to be actively involved
in our industry and will be available to help the
Council any time I am needed.

With warmest regards, I am,

Sincerely,



Albert G. Clay
President

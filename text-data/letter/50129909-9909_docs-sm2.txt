Dear Dr. Lisanti:

I am writing to you concerning the feasibility study of d-nicotine and gamma-vinyl-γ-oxybutyric acid (POBA). Some problems have arisen concerning the availability of some chemicals that we need to complete the study and we would like to ask to extend the study through July 1st. We have found that racemization occurs at the elevated temperature (250°C) and pressure as indicated in our previous report. It is now clear that the yield obtained by this approach is very low and would be of the order of 0-5% which makes the method impractical for preparing larger amounts of d-nicotine. We are therefore evaluating lower temperatures (e.g., 170°C). The chemical synthesis of racemic nicotine looks promising and may be the best solution. However, until the backordered chemicals arrive we will not be able to complete the study. It appears that we have liquidated the world’s supply of cyclopropylbromide!

We have investigated the McKennin synthesis method of POBA and are not at all happy with the procedure or the yield. As an alternative we are looking at the reaction of 3-pyridylmagnesium bromide with succinic anhydride as a possible one-step synthesis. Results of these studies will be discussed in our next report.

Sincerely,

Andrew M. Tometsko, Ph.D.
Director of Research

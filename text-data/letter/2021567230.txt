Dear Dr. Tso:

Attached are the results of our filler analyses on the TWG Series IV samples. There have been two methodological changes since the 1974 study.

1. Total Alkaloid - An aqueous acetic acid extract of tobacco is dialyzed on an Auto Analyzer and reacted with cyanogen bromide and an aromatic amine. The absorbance is measured at 460 nm. RSD at 2 σ = ±2%.

2. Reducing Sugars - An aqueous acetic acid extract of tobacco is dialyzed on an Auto Analyzer. Reducing sugars are reacted with p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide in a basic medium at 95°C and the absorbance is measured at 410 nm. Chlorogenic acid is a positive interference. Standards are 1:1 glucose-fructose. RSD at 2 σ for 2-30% reducing sugars is ±6%. RSD at 2 σ for 0.2-2% reducing sugars is ±1%.

If there are any questions regarding the data or the methodology, please don’t hesitate to call (804-271-2418) or write me. I look forward to seeing the complete tabulation.

I am returning the remaining samples under separate cover.

Sincerely,

Jau
James L. Charles
Senior Scientist

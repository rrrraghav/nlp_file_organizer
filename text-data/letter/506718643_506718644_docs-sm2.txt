Re: Germany - Tax Classification

It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of Finance is likely to tax SPA's as a cigarette. This unfortunate news comes as result of a preliminary report from the customs laboratory to the MOF.

In a meeting this morning with three MOF officials, W. Denbach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and were of the opinion that SPA's characteristics were most similar to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the MOF to classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a cigarette tax rate.

It was stated at the meeting that this report was preliminary and is not binding on the MOF. However, W. Denbach did not see any indication that the MOF would rule differently.

The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance, Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich (the official directly in charge of ROR's request). Absent from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s superior and has been an advocate of ROR’s position. Wilfredric read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a major factor in the MOF’s decision.

Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He went on to say that the political issues of SPA's investment value and social benefits were of no concern to the MOF in its interpretation of the law. In light of this, Wilfredric believes that Mr. Dittrich will feel encouraged to recommend a cigarette tax rate.

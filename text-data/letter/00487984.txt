Dear Ed:

I just returned from the trip, a little tired but everything else
all right.

I have your letters dated July 23 and August 13.

I will be around for a while so let me know your flight number so
I can meet you.

[ I will inquire into the use of the Kent label to package candies
and will let you know.

Looking forward in seeing you and with kindest regards,

Very truly yours,

FABRICA DE CIGARROS BALOYAN.

S. H. Baloyan.

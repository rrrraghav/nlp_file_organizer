Dear Joyce:

Enclosed, please find the array of SALEM, Newport, and Kool tearsheets required by MDD for a Portfolio Test.

There are five ads for each of the brands broken down as follows:

Newport

- 2 full flavor pages
- 2 lights pages (1 Black Market)
- 1 spread

Kool

- 4 pages (1 Black Market)
- 1 spread

SALEM

- 4 pages (1 Black Market)
- 1 spread

Given that this project came out of our SALEM brainstorming session last week, would you please forward whatever you may have from MDD regarding the objectives, questions, sample size, test locations, etc. for this project?

Thanks much.

Sincerely,

Michael P. Aldrich

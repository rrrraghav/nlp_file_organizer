Gentlemen:

Ref: Proposed Legislation-Federal Smoking Restrictions

I am strongly opposed to the Federal government imposing
severe smoking restrictions in the workplace, restaurants,
bars and any other establishments.

If this legislation is passed, it would cause considerable
hardship on the company that I am employed with.

Your reconsideration of this issue would be greatly
appreciated.



Sincerely,

Nancy A. Thomas

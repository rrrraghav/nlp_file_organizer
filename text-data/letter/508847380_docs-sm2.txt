Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter
Sheet Material

The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected
on cigarettes prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test
product (Sample 6) contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaCO3.
(Sample, see mo.) Mr. R. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to
30% total CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F) based on his anal-
ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample 6 was 63 µg/cigarette. The silicon
in the ash at the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS), is a
42d times the level of calcium in the test product (Sample 6) and 3339 µg/
cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for
test product 6 was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 µg/cigarette) and
silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 µg/cigarette versus 0.066
µg silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS.

The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaCO3 present
in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash >99%. The
amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The
amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product 6 was no
greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit
of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 µg/cigarette.

As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton
linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of
up to a level of 30 weight percent (see Sample 6).

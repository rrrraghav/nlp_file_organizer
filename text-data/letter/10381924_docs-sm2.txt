Dear Chris:

The attached article is a good example of
what we discussed the other day. The weaknesses
and deficiencies I see could probably be multi-
plied tenfold by a professional statistician or
epidemiologist.

Data necessary for a true evaluation of the
article are lacking. The journal in which it ap-
pears is known as an organization well-known for
its misleading bias; also, the journal is almost
a "trade organization" publication. You'll note
there’s no mention of the wine (or other) drink-
ing habits of the subjects.

You might want to send a copy to PMI in Lau-
sanne. I’m not sure whether the French Industry
group in Paris, Association de Fabricants Com-
munautaire de Cigarettes, has seen it. I did know
its director, Mme. Hélène Bourgois, but I'm not
sure she’s still there.

With best wishes.

Sincerely,

Leonard S. Zahn

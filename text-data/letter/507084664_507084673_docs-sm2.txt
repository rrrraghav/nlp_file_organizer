ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF

Biochemical Seminar - Dr. George Lunt, Professor of Biochemistry, University of Utah, United Kingdom, presented a seminar on the results of RR# sponsored research he is conducting on the functional properties of nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system. Dr. Lunt also described the use of a state-of-the-art computer-based modeling system in the study of transmitter-receptor interactions.

SAS ETS Survey - Ms. Mary Ward, Dr. Charles Green and Guy Oldaker met with representatives of Philip Morris in Washington, D.C. on August 3 to discuss whether R. J. Reynolds should support a project to survey ETS exposure onboard Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) aircraft. The study would involve DC-940 and -50 aircraft flights throughout Europe originating from SAS bases in Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen. The European Forestry is interested in the study in response to the forthcoming British Air smoking ban and the U.S. future legislative hearings. Philip Morris desires that this project be sponsored by the Center for Indoor Air Research (CIAR) of which they, as well as R. J. Reynolds and BAT have also been asked for funding. If R. J. Reynolds elects participation, our direct participation would involve technical direction only. Sampling and analyses are to be performed by TWO, a laboratory located in similar to the Netherlands, that has developed a sampling system close to R. J. Reynolds Portable air sampling system (PASS) that they intend to use in the survey. Philip Morris and TNO scientists are working together to evaluate the performance of this sampling device relative to the PASS. Results of

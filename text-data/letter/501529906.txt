Dear Dr. Senkus:

You may recall that I reported on the cocarcino-
genicity of catechol and other compounds at a meeting of
the Tobacco Working Group (NIH) about a year ago. That
work has now been completed and written up, and I am sending
you a copy of the manuscript with this letter. I will be
sending it to the J.N.C.I. for publication as soon as I
receive clearance from the offices of Drs. Gio Gori and
Thomas Owen at NCI.

I feel that this work is potentially important
in terms of the development of a less hazardous cigarette.
Also, several new areas of follow-up studies are indicated,
e.g., doses that are more relevant to the ratios of B[a]P:co-
carcinogens as they occur in smoke condensate, etc.

I will welcome any comments you may have regarding
this manuscript.

With kind regards.

Sincerely yours,

B. L. Van Duren
Professor of Environmental Medicine

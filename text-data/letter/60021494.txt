Dear Ms. Johnson:

Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. In response to your request, I am pleased to enclose a copy of the explanatory materials sent by The Council for Tobacco Research to potential principal investigators outlining two step application process. The executive committee of our Scientific Advisory Board first evaluates a Preliminary Application and decides whether or not to encourage submission of a Full Application.

Their decision is based not only on scientific merit, but also on appropriateness for inclusion in one of the Council’s multidisciplinary program areas, as well as recognition of current support levels for similar projects. This procedure takes about two months.

In order that your office has on hand a reference set of our Full Application forms, a sample copy is enclosed. You will also find in this package our Statement of Policy Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

Litte Cienent
Arthur D. Eisenberg

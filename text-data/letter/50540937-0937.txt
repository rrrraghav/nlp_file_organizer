Dear Dr. Peterson,

I am writing to confirm that I am extremely impressed with your ideas of how to use ENU mutagenesis to isolate mutations that affect forebrain development.
I am happy to provide my expertise in the analysis of embryonic forebrain anatomy and my knowledge of the Dlx genes.
To this end, I will send you the Dlx-1 & -2 mutant mice for you to breed with the ENU-mutagenized F1 males. I anticipate that the mutations which you identify will lead to novel insights regarding regulation of the Dlx genes and the function of the Dlx proteins. In addition, I believe that this screen will identify other genes in the Dlx-1 and -2 pathway.

Finally, I believe that the general screen which you propose to perform to identify genes that regulate forebrain development has a high probability of leading to novel insights. Studies like yours are embarking upon will be essential to identifying many of the ones that control forebrain development.

I look forward to this interesting and important study.

Sincerely,

John Rubenstein

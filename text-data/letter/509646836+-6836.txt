INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: ETS Meeting DATE: February 24, 1986

TO: Distribution FROM: Gary T. Burger

Tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in Seminar Room B, we have a meeting with members of the ETS group relating to potential studies that could be done at RJR to support the Environmental Tobacco Smoke program. Attached is a proposed plan to be conducted through the Tobacco Institute. This plan represents a cooperative agreement among the various companies, but is still not finalized. The purpose of tomorrow’s meeting is to "brainstorm" about possible studies to be conducted in-house to help us understand ETS issues. Therefore, tomorrow morning's meeting is merely a round-robin discussion to be followed up with a more in-depth meeting in mid-March that will attack specific issues and plans of action.

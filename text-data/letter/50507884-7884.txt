Dear Dr. Pick:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a proposed research project has now been considered by the Executive Committee of the Scientific Advisory Board.

You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this time concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on the complete proposal.

Sincerely yours,

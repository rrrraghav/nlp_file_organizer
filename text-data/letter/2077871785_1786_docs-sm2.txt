Re: Engle, et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et al.

Dear Ms. Giachino:

Thank you for your May 10, 2000 letter to William S. Ohlemeyer.
Because of my past involvement in the Engle litigation, your letter has been referred to me for response.

For a variety of reasons and on a variety of grounds, Philip Morris Incorporated argued strenuously and repeatedly in Engle against the discovery of any information regarding Philip Morris Incorporated’s consumer lists. Despite Philip Morris d other defendant's objections, the Dade County Judge presiding in Engle ordered that certain consumer list information be provided to class counsel.

In light of the court’s ruling, counsel for Philip Morris Incorporated then took steps intended to maintain the confidentiality interest of Philip Morris Incorporated and its consumers including:

1. Specifying detailed procedure by which no name, address or other identifying information would be produced to class counsel (see attached April 24, 2000 and May 9, 2000 letters to class counsel);

Dear Dr. Falk:

I am sure you are familiar with the name of Dr.
Francis J. C. Roe of the London Hospital Research Laboratories.
He has been working with M. N. Salmon on carcinogenasis and
has done considerable work on tobacco smoke under grants from
the British Empire Cancer Campaign. He is in this country
making a round of several laboratories and will present a
paper at the A.A.C.R. in Chicago.

He expects to be in Los Angeles for a day or two
with some free time on Tuesday, April 12. I am sure the two
of you will find a great deal in common if you can get together
and I have suggested that he pay you a visit. I hope that
you will be available on the day when he happens to be free.

He is prepared to give a seminar in case there should
be an opportunity for this and hopes that he may be able to
supplement his rather meager travel funds by giving one or two.
He has been invited to give one in Madison when he visits
Bontwell and Heidelberg there later in April.

I am glad your new research plan has been approved
since it looks very interesting. You will find that Roe has
some similar ideas. A conference now may help you both to avoid
unnecessary duplication and somewhat integrate your plans so
that the overall product will be maximal. I do not think there
is any shortage of work to be done.

FROM: E. Mc Atee

SUBJECT: B&W MERCHANDISING DIRECTION

Attached is a recap developed from information the field provided us relative to B&W’s intentions/ direction relative to presence in primarily package outlets.

You will note they would prefer an environment with RJR, Lorillard and B&W versus PM. It also appears directionally their presentations will feature a co-existence theme versus B&W and PM.

There is also more than a fair amount of discussion relative to advertising. They intend to tie promotions and advertising together.

As we receive information in this regard, we will keep you informed.

Re: M-2 P.O.S.

Dear Dan,

Reflecting on our discussion of M-2 P.O.S., here’s an idea for consideration.

First, perhaps a non-traditional use of P.O.S. might be advisable for M-2 given its unique consumer franchise goal. For example, we could consider using a P.O.S. display to carry a unique consumer premium offer and coupon; a 20 or 320 pack display might feature both the product and a premium that assists in quickly positioning the brand.

Secondly, the device could achieve a higher trial rate as well as building rapid awareness.

Recommendation:

The agency believes the use of a self-liquidating premium that positions M-2 as:

•	Female
•	Fashionable/Stylish
•	Modern

could add immediate impact to M-2 image perception at the very start of its launch. Thus properly positioned in the younger female adult smokers’ mind, we should achieve greater awareness and trial than might be otherwise expected.

Consider the use of a premium like a brushed chrome metal cigarette case and/or a slim stick chrome lighter on P.O.S. materials. Either or both could conceivably be self-liquidated via coupon plus proof of purchase and cash.

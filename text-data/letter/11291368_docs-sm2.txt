Dear Mr. Reames:

In the absence from the city of Mr. T.V. Hartnett,
Chairman of the Tobacco Industry Committee, to whom
your recent letter was referred by the Associated Tobacco
Manufacturers, I want to thank you for your interest and courtesy
in advancing suggestions regarding the current cigarette contro-
versy.

As you may know, the Tobacco Industry Research
Committee has been set up to organize and supervise a thorough
scientific study of any possible connection between tobacco use
and health. It is advised in this research program by a group
of distinguished cancer experts and scientists who comprise our
Scientific Advisory Board.

Any suggestions or ideas regarding this important
investigation, which you care to advance, will be brought to the
attention of our scientific advisors.

Sincerely,

W. T. Hoyt,
Executive Secretary.

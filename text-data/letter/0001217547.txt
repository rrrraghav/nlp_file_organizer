Dear Avery and Art:

This requests an Agency point-of-view on the use of Bestboards for future
VICEROY advertising. Some issues to be addressed are:

1)  Intervenous
2)  Effect on brand image
3)  Ability to convey brand strategy (will vary by campaign)
4)  Cost
5)  Aid or deterrent to persuasion (effectiveness)
6)  Reach
7)  Ability to reach target audience
8)  Frequency
9)  Broadcasting vehicle or problem market, ad hoc one
10)  Visibility (actual delivery of stated impressions)
11) Effect on current translation
12)  Effect on current production
13) A replacement or supplement for outdoor?

This list is not exhaustive, so feel free to address other areas of interest.
We are particularly interested in your assessment as to whether this is
appropriate. In our total marketing effort to revitalize VICEROY, innovative
media such as these may be considered. Your feedback on Bestboards is a first
step in this direction. We would appreciate your response by July 16. An
informal document will suffice.

Sincerely,

G. T. Held

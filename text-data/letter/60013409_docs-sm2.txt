Dear Dr. McAllister:

I am certainly pleased to acknowledge and accept with thanks the checks from The Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A. in the total amounts of $12,500.00 in support of the following five Summer Conferences to be held in 1989:

Bone Marrow Transportation
Calcium and Cell Function
Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements
Molecular Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis
Ubiquitin

The Federation and the scientists who comprise it are appreciative of your interest in assisting us to improve scientific communication. The funds will be used by the chairpersons of the conferences to defray the travel and registration expenses for some of the speakers.

We extend an invitation to the scientists of your organization who are interested in attending any of the FASEB Summer Research Conferences. In 1989 there will again be eight conferences held under our auspices ten in Saxons River, Vermont, and eight at our second site in Copper Mountain, Colorado.

I have enclosed for your interest a copy of the FASEB Public Affairs Newsletter. It is published monthly by our Office of Public Affairs to keep Federation members and other readers abreast of the latest developments in Congress and In Executive Branch agencies that may affect biological and clinical research.

Please express to the appropriate officials my thanks and appreciation for your generous support of these conferences.

Sincerely,

Robert W. Krauss
Executive Director

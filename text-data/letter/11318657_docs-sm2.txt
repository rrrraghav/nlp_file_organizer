Dear Bill:

Attached is a check covering your expenses and
two days per diem for the Scientific Advisory Board meeting.

Please let me know when you plan to take your
vacation this summer as I want to get down to Baltimore
and have a talk with you some time soon.

Jill joins me in sending her best regards to
you and Frances.

Sincerely,

W. T. Hoyt
Executive Vice President

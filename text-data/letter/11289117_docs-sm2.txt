The little booklet we have the honour to send you herewith
has just out of press.
We ask you to have the kindness to take a look on this
“BROCHURE”.
For the 2nd time, we organize in BRUSSELS (Belgium), the 2nd

it will be a great pleasure for our organisation if you
will kindly accept to inform your readers of your or-
ganisation (Tobacco Producers and Manufacturers) about the
holding of this World Convention.

Hoping we may count on your great kindness to do,sincerely

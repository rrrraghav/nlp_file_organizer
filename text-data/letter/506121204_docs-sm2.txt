Subject: Bird Delta Washer
RJR P.O. #87-09047

Dear Sir:

In response to your concerns relative to the above referenced order, you can be assured that the design of this unit in no way infringes on any existing patents.

The Bird Delta-Washer design employs an air-liquid separation system which is common practice on all Fourdrinier paper machines and makes no attempt to control the level within the individual vacuum receptacles.

Furthermore, the patents for the original Fourdrinier type pulp washer are owned and were developed by Ontario Paper Co. and C.I.P. Co. from whom we license the rights to the Delta-Washer technology.

In summary, we can assure you that the Bird Delta-Washer is free of any infringement and, in fact, incorporates the most advanced technology in countercurrent washing.

Best regards.

Very truly yours,

J. A. Daugherty
Vice President
Sales & Marketing

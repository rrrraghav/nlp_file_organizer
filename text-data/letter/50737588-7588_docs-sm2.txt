Dear Hans:

After talking to you I had Steve Laird prepare an application statement for a supplement to our current contract between Bio-Research Institute, Inc. and CTT to enable us to study respiratory sounds and certain other physiological parameters in smoke-exposed Syrian hamsters. Preliminary work showed that this non-destructive approach promises to furnish a wealth of information relatively soon after beginning the exposure. Once the comparison between in vivo sound tracings, respiratory frequencies and magnitudes and anatomical findings which have been made this will provide a new approach to the study of effects of smoke upon pulmonary function and health.

Unfortunately through an unbelievable mix-up in the mails this material mailed from Boston on August 13th reached me this morning. No time remains now for clearing it up and I am sending it to you in its present draft form which conveys the meaning.

I hope you can convince your colleagues on the CTT advisory committee that this is a worthwhile effort and that we can get the funds to purchase the equipment which we have currently borrowed and improvised.

I am sending Bob Hockett copies of all of this so that he is informed of our discussions.

With many thanks and best regards,

P.S. I just learned that Dr. Lisanti visited us today and is Mully
informed on this. It is important that we get immediate attention Homberger
so that we can use for study the animals now being exposed.
The brass equipment now being used is only a loan to us
and I do not know how long we can keep it.

Re: Limited Trademark and Trade Name
Agreement between Loew's Theatres, Inc.,
and Moorgate Tobacco Company, Ltd.

Dear Mr. DeWitt:

I refer to my letter dated October 31, 1979, request-
ing samples for quality control purposes under this
Agreement. We consider this matter urgent, and we request
that you arrange to have such samples received by Lorillard
within the next thirty days. Failing receipt, we must
consider you to be in breach of the Limited Trademark and
Trade Name Agreement, and it will be necessary for us to
look to our appropriate remedies.

Very truly yours,

Arthur J. Stevens

AJS/hc

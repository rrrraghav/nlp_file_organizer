Dear Leo:

It was certainly a pleasure having Walt and you visit Roswell on September 4. We are looking forward to hosting a larger group from Philip Morris, hopefully including Ken Houghton, at your convenience.

Samples of differential burn rate paper have been forwarded to you by Tim Groiman. I hope they meet with your approval.

Finally, as we discussed during your visit, there are several new developments that we would like to discuss with you. It will be necessary to execute a confidentiality agreement to permit discussion of these developments. To that end I have attached two copies of a standard Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement signed by Henry Todd. Please have these signed by the appropriate person at Philip Morris.

When this is done, we will arrange a meeting to discuss these develop-
ments. If you have any questions, please contact either Henry or me.

Sincerely,

Donnald F. Durocher
Dr. Donald F. Durocher
Manager, Specialty Products R&D

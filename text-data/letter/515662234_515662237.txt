Dear Mr. Kirby:

I refer to the captioned License Agreement of September 8, 1971, by and between Reynolds Leasing Corporation and Lorillard.

Enclosed is Lorillard check number 089167 payable to Reynolds Leasing in the amount of $281,625.00, representing royalties for the period of October 1, 1978 through December 31, 1978, pursuant to Article III, paragraph (i) of the License Agreement, and the subsequent modification of February 13, 1973.

In addition, a report showing the "quantity of tobacco successfully treated by licensed process", required by Article V, paragraph A of the License Agreement, is enclosed.

Please refer to the statement of Lorillard’s protest with respect to payment of royalties under the License Agreement, as set forth in Arthur Stevens' letter to Manford Haxton of January 19, 1976. That protest is reaffirmed and fully incorporated herein.

Sincerely yours,

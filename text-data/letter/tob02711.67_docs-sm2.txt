Dear Horace:

Reference is made to your exchange of
letters of June 22 and June 29 with Bill Hesse
regarding the ATI establishment of a more
proactive Washington presence - and the TI’s
plans to be in contact with the Association
regarding mutual concerns.

The attachment from Ad Age (9/25/78)
refers to further steps in that regard.

Very truly yours,

Arthur J. Stevens

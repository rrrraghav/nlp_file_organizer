Dear Dr. Jones:

The Board of Directors of The Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory approved a budget of
$1,026,400 for the calendar year 1995.

Your company’s assessment for Testing Laboratory expenditures for the first half of 1995
is $44,140. The attached schedule shows the computation of this assessments. Your
remittance check should be made payable to The Tobacco Institute and sent to my
attention.

For purposes of Section 6033(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, we estimate that none of
this assessment is attributed to activities that are treated as lobbying under section 162(e)
of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, all of this payment will be deductible as a
business expense for federal income tax purposes. Assessments and other payments to
The Tobacco Institute are not deductible as charitable contributions.

Sincerely,

William A. Adams

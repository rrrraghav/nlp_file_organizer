REF: SELECTIVE FILTER ADDITIVE

I attach a copy of a notice which we have received from our Hong Kong
office, which may be important enough to follow up. It is claimed that
scientists in Moscow have developed a filter additive which supposedly
absorbs 100% of the nitric oxide from the cigarette smoke. Unfortunately no
reference is given as to where the information was received, and it may be
necessary to contact Esmerk directly.

Kind regards.

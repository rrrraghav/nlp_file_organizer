Dear Denise:

RE: B&H May Topline Response Report

This forwards the May Topline Response Report for B&H.

Background

This report tracks responses loaded to the database by offer type for all B&H 1993 and 1994 direct programs and promotions that have not received a final program analysis. The source of the data is current responders loaded to the report database as of the May 4, 1994 update. Coupon redemption information is based on the coupon redemption highlight dated 4/20/94.

Highlights

•	Coupon redemption is significantly below projections for all 1993 mailings indicating that projections may have been optimistic.

•	For the 1993 mailings that used loyalty scoring (August Mugs & Coffee and Nov. Pizza Mailing), Ultra Loyal and Loyal cells have higher coupon and premium response than Vulnerable cells or unknown loyalty cells.

The August Mugs & Coffee Mailing Ultra Loyal test cell offering higher coupon values with lower UPC requirements has a higher response rate than the Ultra Loyal control cell (25% vs. 19% for coupons and 23% vs. 17% for premiums). Conversely, higher UPC requirements for Loyal and Vulnerable test cells negatively impacted premium response compared to their respective control cells (12% vs. 19% for Loyals and 10% vs. 14% for Vulnerables).

The following investigations/reconciliations are in progress:

•	Abnormally high response rate to premiums (50%) in the Nov. Pizza Loyal test cell.
•	Premium responses for the 1994 Jan. Pizza Mailing have been loaded to the 1993 Nov. Pizza Mailing due to the use of the same P.O. Boxes.

We look forward to receiving your comments so that we can best tailor the report to your needs. Please call me at 312-220-3092 if you have any questions.

Best Regards,
LEO BURNETT U.S.A.

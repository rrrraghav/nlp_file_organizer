RE: Use of Brand Names on Matchbooks

Dear Mr. Blynn:

I now chair the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement Committee. The Committee has your letter dated May 10, 2000, which responds to our letter of April 13, 2000, wherein we expressed our view that Brand Name advertising on matchbooks violates section III(f) of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G. Gaston, attorney for D.D. Bean & Sons Co. We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by your position.

The distinctions cited in your letter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of the MSA. As we previously explained, matchbooks are "merchandise" within the meaning of section III(f) of the MSA because they may be bought and sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within any of the exceptions specified in section III(f). Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products; their sole function is not advertising of Tobacco Products, and they are not written or electronic publications. Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name Merchandise imposed by section III(f).

Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is no consequence that matchbooks may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section III(f) of the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use… any Brand Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself”

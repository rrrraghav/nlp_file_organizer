PUBLIC ACTION TO PROTECT ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES

November 29, 1972

Dear John:

It appears to be universal practice for cigarette companies w advertise in Spanish display the required health warnings in English.
I am enclosing several advertisements taken from current Spanish publications such as El Diario, ABC de las Americas, and Tomas. In addition, I saw a lighted display sign in a subway station advertising Kent cigarettes in Spauics, with the warning in tiny English letters.

Six cigarette companies are covered by the consent orders which the FTC accepted on March 30, 1972 (Lorillard, Docket No. C-2180; Phillip Morris Inc., Docket No. C-2181; American Brands, Inc., Docket No. C-2182; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Docket, No. C-2183; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Docket No. C-2184; and Ligget & Myers Incorporated, Docket No. C-2185).

They will certainly argue that their conduct is in precise compliance with the letter of the agreement, which specifies the exact wording of the health warning. The companies agreed to:

Cease and desist from advertising any such cigarette unless respondent makes ... clear and conspicuous disclosure of the statement prescribed in Section 4 of Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-222) which reads:

"Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined that Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health."
[Order, ¶ 1]

The Order defines the term "clear and conspicuous disclosure" as:

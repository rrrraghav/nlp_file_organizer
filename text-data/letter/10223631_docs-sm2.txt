Dear Joan:

Here are the figures you requested. They are fairly accurate and should hold up for the next several months. The date from 1954, the year CTR was established (as Tobacco Industry Research Committee).

About $40-million in research support (grants and contracts.

More than 670 original grants and contracts and many more renewals.

Grants awarded to some 360 independent scientists in about 215 medical schools, hospitals and research institutions.

Grantees have published some 8510 papers acknowledging CTR support.

I hope the data are what you want. Please let me know if I can be further help.

With best regards,

Sincerely,

Leonard S. Zohn

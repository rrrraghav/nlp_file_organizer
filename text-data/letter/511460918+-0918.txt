From: Alan Rodman

Based on the present state of knowledge re sorbate/sorbic acid use
as a mold inhibitor, it is recommended that the Company proceed with
its plans to incorporate sorbate/sorbic acid in its products.

Sorbate/sorbic acid is used extensively by various tobacco
manufacturers in Europe and by PBI domestically.

Extensive studies by Monsanto showed no adverse effects; preliminary
studies by the USDA showed some allergy effects from combined use of
nitrite/sorbate. Further studies are planned on nitrite/sorbate by the
USDA and the FHU.

The present recommendation may require modification at some future
time depending on the results of the two proposed studies.

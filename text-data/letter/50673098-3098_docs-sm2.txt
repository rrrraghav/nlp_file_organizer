RE: Case number 6705

Dear Dr. Hashim,

Enclosed please find the original and 6 copies of my application to the Council for Tobacco Research titled, "Growth factor-stimulated transcription of the MCP-1 “slow” immediate-early gene by novel 5’ enhancer elements.” This proposal requests 3 years of funding from the Council and describes experiments which will characterize two critical control elements operative in growth factor-stimulated transcription of the MCP-1 immediate-early gene. The MCP-1 gene (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) codes for the potent CC chemokine MCP-1 which has been shown to play important roles in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. The MCP-1 protein can also be used in the treatment of a number of malignancies.

Success in the areas discussed in this application will yield new insights into novel signal transduction pathways as well as a number of specific (DNA and protein) targets, important in transcriptional control, for future rational drug design.

Thank you for your consideration of these materials.

Sincerely,

Rolf Freter M.D., Ph.D.

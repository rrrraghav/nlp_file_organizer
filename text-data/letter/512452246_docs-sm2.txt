Dear Dr. Barton:

In response to your conversation with Dr. Murray
Senkus and your letter of August 22nd, we will be glad
to evaluate your new synthetic pulp fiber as a cigarette
filter medium on a non-confidential basis. Please give
us your written assurance that we will be assuming no
greater obligation than would be the case if you offered
us an issued patent for our consideration.

If this is satisfactory to you, please send about
one kilogram of the material, if this much is readily
available, and we will give you our appraisal.

Very truly yours,

Manford R. Paxton
Associate Counsel

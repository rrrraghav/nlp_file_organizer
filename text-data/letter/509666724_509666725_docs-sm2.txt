Dear Mr. Eschwege:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the General Accounting Office (GAO) draft report entitled “Regulation of Cancer-Causing Food Additives: Is It Time for a Change?”

The report discusses the Delaney Clause of the 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of cancer-causing food additives.  According to the draft report, some experts believe the Delaney Clause should be changed because of its inflexibility; however, they disagree on alternative regulations to the present statute.

The GAO report also points out that the requirements of the Delaney Clause are inconsistent with the statutes mandating the approaches used by EPA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For this reason and also because of advances in scientific methodology and uncertainties about the human risks from low-level carcinogens and the inflexibility that exists under the Delaney Clause, GAO recommends that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

EPA concurs with the general findings and conclusions that GAO has reached in its analysis. EPA also concurs that these findings provide a sound basis for GAO’s recommendation that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.

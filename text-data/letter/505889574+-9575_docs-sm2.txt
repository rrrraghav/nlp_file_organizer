Subject: Product Testing
Timetable - 1986 Date: August 5, 1986

To: M.D. Wallace From: K.A. Needs

Attached is a flow chart of the consumer and extended use product testing for the remainder of 1986. The point with critical impact on this entire expressive schedule occurs immediately following the 12/3 Product decision for the Wave VI Consumer Test. If at that time, the polypropylene filter is not incorporable, several problems will ensue.

The first will be the burden placed on Ken Rush’s extended use test and external mini product concept test (20 days production time from 9/24 - 10/23). This obviously would necessitate the exclusion of almost all other test products being manufactured during this time period.

Secondly and more important, the 12/3 Product Concept Test products will have to be produced by Operations Development due to the large quantity of products required. This, the failure to have the polypropylene filter incorporated into the Wave VI Consumer Test would lead to introducing it into the 12/3 Product Concept Test with no prior consumer information.

Hopefully, these issues can be resolved quickly so that our current timetables are not impacted. If you have further questions, please give me call.

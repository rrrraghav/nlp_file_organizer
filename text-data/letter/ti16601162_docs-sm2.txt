HELP IF YOU NEED!
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT

The Honorable Thomas A. Bliley, Jr.

Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Tom:

I am writing to you about a "Dear Colleague" letter that you sent on August 4 regarding H.R. 3434.

I am not surprised, of course, that we disagree on this issue. I am surprised and disappointed, however, that you have taken such a personal tone in your criticism. There is no substantive argument in the Washington Post excerpt you circulated to our colleagues; instead, it is a mean-spirited attack on my character and reputation.

I have come to expect these tactics from the tobacco companies, but not from you. I am sorry you saw fit to respond to our disagreement over H.R. 3434 in this way.

Sincerely,

Henry A. Waxman
Member of Congress

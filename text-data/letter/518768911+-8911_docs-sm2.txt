RE: Winston Advertising

As you are now aware the 20g box down on Winston cigarettes is through the end
of August. This extension coincides with the major advertising campaign entitled
"Winston No-Bull!" about our brand. This campaign not only promotes the new
packaging, but more importantly the fact that Winston contains "No Additives".

To tie - in with the “No Bull” theme we have authorized three pieces of P.O.S.
advertising.

* Business Hour Sign
* Push / Pull Door Sign
* “ No Bull ” Outdoor Banner to be used whenever possible
and a smaller window aler sign.

Your R.J. representative will provide the material on their next store call.

We are receiving an allowance in addition to the buy down for supporting
this promotion. Please make certain we cooperate with the posting of the material
through Labor Day.

This Advertising will Be Extended
through the Remainder of 1997

Subject: S.391 A Bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act
to reduce the levels of lead in the environment, and
for other purposes



S.391 was introduced in the Senate as the "Lead Exposure
Reduction Act of 1990" and was reintroduced February 2, 1991 by
Senators Reid, Lieberman, Bradley, Moynihan, Jeffords, Bryan,
Lautenberg, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Wirth, Gore, Kennedy, Kerry and
Dodd. It is now the "Lead Exposure Reduction Act of 1991". In the
attached copy of this bill, not all of the 1990 dates have been
changed to 1991. In the following I have attempted to summarize
the key sections of this complex bill.

Dear Mr. Willington:

There is a movement afloat to extend and/or broaden the airline smoking ban. I am opposed to this restriction on smoking on a public conveyance.

Although I am a smoker this is certainly not the only reason for my opposition. For smokers and nonsmokers alike there is entirely too much government regulation in America today. Further, there is no compelling scientific evidence to prove that tobacco smoke in the environment is dangerous to nonsmokers.

My frequent trips to New York City now are made by car (smog). Almost nonsmokers or "allergic" do have a choice of nonsmoking air-lines.

Please do what you can to see that the ban on smoking is lifted. Thank you for your time. I would appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

Very truly yours,

Carole Gaul

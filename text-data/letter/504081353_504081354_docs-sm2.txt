ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF

• Cigarette Banding Policy - Representatives from MDD, Brands RD and RAD Technical Services met to discuss procedures currently used for banding test products. Changes in the required design and perforation location over the past few years have required that the band change location depending on some products. This has caused some concern within MDD in comparison data from tests with the different locations. A new policy will be written by mid-April setting standards for banding width and location for each style that may be run to ensure long-term consistency within each brand style. Cases where uniquely designed bands tipping these standards unacceptable will be discussed with MDD and Brands before banding.

• Study to Improve Stem Extraction for G7 - Analytical support is being provided to Tobacco Processing to evaluate modifications in the extraction procedure used in the preparation of stems for G7. The study is related to the higher nitrate content of G7 resulting from the addition of whitewater from bullies stems in the process.

• Recall of all Outstanding Library Materials – The RRD Library collection will undergo a complete retrospective conversion to the full library of Congress cataloging system in the next several weeks. The entire collection will be inventoried, re-labeled, bar-coded and reshelved. All materials checked out to R&D staff, including desk copies, must be returned to the Library no later than Friday, April 20, 1984.

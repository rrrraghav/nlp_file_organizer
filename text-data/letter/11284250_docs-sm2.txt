Mr. W. T. Hoyt,
Tobacco Research Committee,
150 East 42nd Street,
New York 17, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hoyt:

Recent publicity in the press about the "findings" by researchers concerning the effect of cigarette smoking on lung cancer has created a situation which may have some effect on cigarette sales. And if the researchers press their claims further I believe that cigarette sales will be affected a great deal with monetary losses to the tobacco industry.

I firmly believe that should the researchers prove beyond doubt that excess cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, the tobacco industry would suffer greatly. Conversely, if the so-called "experts" indications informed us there is no danger of lung cancer in cigarette smoking, even excessively, they would retract their “hostility” toward smoking and again may come to the support of the cigarette industry.

I have been studying this problem for some time and I have discovered a “solution” which I believe (to say the least) is remarkable.
I would like to present my solution to the proper "agency" but I would like to be compensated for this service. If your organization is the proper "agency" to negotiate a proposition please let me know and I will submit it to you. Of course, if my “solution” is not acceptable you are not obligated to pay me anything.

If your organization is not the proper "agency" to negotiate such a proposition (authorized to pay for services) would you be kind enough to let me know of their name and address?



Sincerely yours,
George Hall

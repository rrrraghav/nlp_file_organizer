To whom it may concern:

As mayor of the City of Kingwood, West Virginia, I am writing to protest the FDA’s proposed regulations restricting the sale and distribution of cigars. In a blatant power grab, the FDA is attempting to federalize an area that states have asserted sovereignty over. We have passed legislation in West Virginia to deal with youth access to tobacco products.

The proposed regulations place huge and unfair burdens on the business community. These regulations will cost jobs that we desperately need in West Virginia. The proposed regulations should be withdrawn. The issue of youth access to tobacco products should be left to the states.

Sincerely,

Fred C. Piddicoat, III

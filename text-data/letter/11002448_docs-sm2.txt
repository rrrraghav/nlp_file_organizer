RE: Aughenbaugh v. Roberts, Supreme Court #636843
Initiative Petition regarding alcohol tax increases

Dear Chief Justice Peterson:

I have been notified that the initiative petition referenced above contains an insignificant error in ORS citation.

As the chief petitioner, I want to make it clear that this error in no way affects the ability of petitioners or signers to understand the initiative.

Therefore, I will not be withdrawing this initiative.

Thank you for your time as you consider the technicalities of the Attorney General’s title. Unfortunately, I fear that there will be further frivolous litigation by those who value strategy over substance.

I look forward to the Court's timely response on the title question.
Sincerely,

Rick Bauman
Chief Petitioner
Oregon Health Initiatives

Dear Commissioner Kessler:

As an advertising professional, I am writing to express my opposition to the FDA’s proposed rules on tobacco advertising. They violate the First Amendment and will not achieve the goal of reducing teenage smoking.

The proposed rules violate the free speech rights of advertisers by restricting speech based solely on its content. The United States Supreme Court has clearly stated that truthful commercial speech for lawful products enjoys the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution.

If these restrictions are implemented, they will not achieve the goal of reducing teenage consumption of tobacco products. Studies have shown that advertising has little or no effect on a youth’s decision to smoke. Peer pressure, as well as parental and family role models, are much greater influences. In addition, in countries where advertising has been banned, consumption levels have either remained the same or increased.

I don't condone the use of tobacco products by minors, but the proposed rules are unlawful restrictions on free speech. I would encourage more effective solutions, such as increased enforcement of existing state laws restricting the sale of tobacco products to minors.

Thank you for consideration of my views.

Respectfully submitted,

Your name and address.

Dear Dr. Kreisher:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 13, 1973,
confirming your earlier order for thirteen million reference cigarettes
plus as many low nicotine cigarettes as we might be able to produce.

Currently, we are negotiating with a manufacturer to produce our
new supply of reference cigarettes and your order will be included in
the new contract.

At this time, we do not know what the exact cost of the new cigarettes
will be; however, we do expect the cost to be up from the earlier production,
possibly as much as double—approximately $8.00 per thousand.

We will continue to keep you informed on this effort and as soon
as we have an exact price, we will advise you.

Sincerely,

Alvin L. Morris
Interim Director

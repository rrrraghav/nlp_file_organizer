TO: Dr. Lawrence FROM: Fred Best

SUBJECT: QUARTERLY REPORT; 3rd Quarter 1989

1. Determine the migration and homogeneity of labeled flavor TIME ALLOCATION
materials over time applied at various sites within PREMIER NN. 05%
STATUS:
This work was finished in 2nd quarter. R&DM is in preparation.

2. Determine the fate of specific labeled flavor materials in 05%
PREMIER NN.
STATUS:
This work was finished in 2nd quarter. R&DM is in preparation.

3. Coordinate a pack aroma development program. 01%
STATUS:
Literature survey and efforts to increase personal knowledge of
cigarette pack aroma (flavoring and top dressing) are on-going.
Caln D-20 Digital Recording Balance that will allow us
to measure weight losses of volatile components either neat or as
mixtures and from various substrates either in a flowing gas
stream or under static conditions has been received. Other
projects have prevented pursuing this effort.

4. Evaluate the use of Kaymich equipment to apply menthol to a 01%
cigarette at the maker.
STATUS:
Work will begin in 4th quarter.

5. Identify and explore new product ideas as they relate to 05%
flavor systems.
STATUS:
* wrote disclosure suggesting that tobaccos be extracted to
remove nicotine and flavor constituents, then carbonize the
extracted tobacco and make sheets via Jack White’s method, then
reconstitute the sheets (either cut or uncut) and then make
cigarettes. This enriches the nicotine and extractable flavor
content (without addition of exogenous nicotine or flavorants) by
reducing the mass of the residue. This will provide a very high
nicotine to tar ratio smoke and should avoid problems associated
with adding nicotine to products. Jack has made the sheets and we
are currently determining the best way to make cigarettes and we
planning experiments.

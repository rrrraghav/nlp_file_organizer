Experimental Shelf Life

The P.G.C. temperature humidity cabinet arrived 3-7-85. An existing cabinet is having microprocessor controls installed and will be operational about May 1st. I attended a short course on temperature-humidity cabinets. This background information, especially in microprocessor control has enabled cabinet operation to proceed. The P.G.C. cabinets have extensive cycling capability and could be used to great effect on shelf life studies of regular tobacco products.

Units have been prepared containing (PG60 and 28% B3) and APC and 50% B3. They have been aged at 94°F and 90% RH and samples taken. Analytical results will start arriving within a week. They will elucidate the migration of glycerine and water uptake several weeks aging does appear to physically soften the fuel source.

Long term aging is still premature. However, forced accelerated aging at temperature >100°F may prove advantageous. U.S. Weather Bureau information on temperature and relative humidity would allow us to create hour by hour chemicals for any location in the country.

Thermal Analysis

Some instruction was received on DSC and the computerization of the Perkin Elmer equipment. C. Banerjee requested analyses on six more samples.

Hot air puffing was discontinued before it got started. The experimental difficulty coupled with lack of utility made it unfeasible.

Dear Mr. Hoyt:

RE: Proposed Supplemental Agreement to Contract
between The Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc.
and Union Carbide Corporation, Nuclear Division

Enclosed are six copies of a proposed Supplemental Agreement No. 3 to
the existing contract between CTR and UCCND covering the Council’s
support of a research project at the Hollifield (formerly Oak Ridge)
National Laboratory in the area of “Characterization of Animal Exposure
Systems”. This supplemental agreement extends the period of performance
for one year from the effective date, May 10, 1975, and includes a re-
vised statement of services to be performed by the Laboratory. The
agreement further provides for the Council’s reimbursement of laboratory
expenses during the extended term of the agreement, in an amount not to
exceed $260,000.

This research effort is expected to involve 5.0 man years, with esti-
mated costs as follows:

Direct salaries                $105,000
Indirect expenses              115,000
Materials and services          30,000
Special equipment               4,000
Travel                         2,000
                                $260,000

If satisfactory, please execute and return five copies of the supple-
mental agreement. After obtaining formal approval by the Energy Re-
search and Development Administration, we will furnish you one fully
executed copy and any conformed copies as you desire.

Yours very truly,

Dear Roger:

I just received the report which you and Hurst Marshall compiled
on the Durango Legislative Seminar. I think you hit the high
points right on the head and neatly and concisely summarized the
event.

I thank you for favoring us with a copy of your report.

Bill and I enjoyed the opportunity to break bread with you during
your interview visit to Tallahassee last week. It's always good
to have you in the community and we look forward to the opportunity
when you may return. Let us know and we’ll roll out the red carpet.

With kindest personal regards, I remain



Sincerely,

Wilson W. Wright

Dear Doctor McIver:

Thank you for your letter of October 3rd, concerning
the use of the balance of $2,000* remaining from your grant on
October 1, 1967.

I gather from your letter that your requirements
really are for intended commitments even though in some
instances they have not been formalized; consequently, we
have no objection to your carrying forward the balance you
have on hand for application to the current grant which began
on October 1, 1967.

Sincerely,

W. T. Hoyt
Executive Director

Dear Doctor Furst:

Upon the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Board
to the Council For Tobacco Research, a supplementary grant has been
approved in the amount of $2,000.00, for the purpose of replacing the
smoking machine which was transferred to the Faison Research Institute.

This grant is to supplement the grant for $33,314.00 which
was activated on April 1, 1967.

The Board also reviewed your application for a research
grant to continue your studies on nickel in relation to smoking, but
deferred action to their March meeting.

In the meanwhile we plan to have a member of the Board
contact you in order that we may be better informed on certain aspects
of the problem.



Sincerely yours,

W. T. Hoyt
Executive Director

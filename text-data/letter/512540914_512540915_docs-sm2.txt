THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

WASHINGTON

JUN 12 1998

The Honorable Robert B. Wise, Jr.
House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Congressman Wise:

My responsibility as Secretary of Veterans Affairs is to provide a safe patient environment. America’s proud veterans, whether smokers or not, require no artificial crutch on which to base their dignity. It is inherent.

Recently, you received a letter from Representatives Wise and Ridge urging you to support the smoking provisions included in H.R. 5192. They would appear to believe that it is a matter of dignity to permit smoking inside VA health care facilities. The issue is not dignity -- the issue is health care.

Consider those who must endure catheters in the heart or artery, or ventilation tubes to enable breathing, because smoking has so impaired their health. Or the patients who suffer the side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, loss of hair, and infections. These are the dreadful results of smoking. And these same ill effects can happen to non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke.

The smoking provisions are the antithesis of good health practices. Smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills. Let me set the record straight on a few issues raised by the congressmen:

o Only one of four veterans smoke. We provide outdoor smoking shelters at VA medical centers. Long-term and chronic care patients can still purchase tobacco from VA cantines with medical approval of their physician. We have instituted smoking cessation programs to assist patients and employees who wish to stop smoking.

o The veteran who chooses to smoke does so of his own accord. VA’s policy establishes medical center environments that encourage non-smoking behavior, particularly among people who already have major health problems which are aggravated by smoking, and protects those who do not smoke and who can be damaged by exposure to others' smoke.

MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION

Thank you for your interest in The Tobacco
Institute’s "It's the Law" program. “It’s the Law” is
available in the 36 states where the minimum age
to purchase tobacco products is 18 and the 3
states where the minimum age is 19. Because
your state has no age limit, or has an age that is
lower than 18, program materials are not available.

The Tobacco Institute will support passage of
new state laws setting a minimum age of 18 for
cigarette sales in those states without a minimum
age law or one lower than 18.

When your state establishes 18 as the
minimum age to buy tobacco products, please fill
out the enclosed order form. We will be happy to
send you all the materials you need.

Attn: Clarence Cook Little

Dear Mr. Little:

We of the American Foot Health Foundation are
extremely interested in a study dealing with the correlation
of blood flow and perfusion as related to tobacco intake.

I have personally been involved in these
type of studies before. I participated with Dr. Walter Redisch
in several tobacco projects at New York University when I was
engaged in post-graduate work in vascular physiology. My
personal interest is in micro-vascular physiology.

Do you know about any funds available by
groups such as your own for research projects dealing with
the effects of tobacco on the flow and perfusion in the lower
extremities?

I would appreciate any help you can furnish
along these lines.

Thanking you in advance I remain,

Cordially,

Abraham A. Coster, D.S.C.

RJRT INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: Freon 123/Freon 11
Residue Decay
Study in Packaged
Cigarettes Date: April 10, 1990

To: Michael F. Borgarding From: Rhenda H. Steele

At RJRT, once tobacco is expanded, this tobacco can be used to make cigarettes in approximately two to six hours. Once cigarettes are made, the cigarettes can be in the consumer’s hand in as little as three to four weeks, although the industry average is three to four months. With these times in mind, the following sampling points have been chosen for the packaged cigarette residue decay study:

Day 0 (remove cigarettes from freezer)
Day 1
Day 4
Day 7 (1 week)
Day 14
Day 28 (1 month)
Day 42
Day 56 (2 months)
Day 70
Day 84 (3 months).

These data are needed in order to estimate smoker exposure to Freon 123 by the August decision date. It is understood that this study will probably need to be repeated once PTD optimizes the Freon 123 expansion process in order to obtain a more accurate curve for consumer exposure assessment.

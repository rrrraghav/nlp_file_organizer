INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

RUR

October 27, 1982

SUBJECT: Project CC Brand Development Plan
TO: Mr. J. D. Phillips

The following Action Plan was developed in response to recent NFO data that indicated CC Prototypes were deficient when compared to Merit without concept.

I. Tar Variations 2

New Brand Marketing agreed to open up the tar restraint of current 8 mg to within the FFLT category. Three ‘tar’ categories will be investigated in order to determine the effect ‘tar’ has on perception of CC taste, they are 5, 10, and 15 mg ‘tar’.

II. Pressure Drop of Cigarette 2

The current CC products were developed at approximately 120mm draft. In previous testing it was determined that increasing the pressure drop produced a smoother and milder taste. Two additional drafts at 140mm and 150-160mm will be investigated.

III. Blend Variations 3

Previous testing with increased turkish tobacco indicated that an improvement may be made in taste with further increases. Blends with 20% and 30% turkish tobacco and also elimination of G7 will be investigated.

IV. Flavor Modifications 3

Flavor R&D will provide Brand R&D with three flavor systems in an attempt to modify the sidestream aroma and taste.

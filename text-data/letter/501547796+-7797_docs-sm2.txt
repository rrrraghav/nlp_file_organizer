Dear Dr. Wakeham:

At a meeting held in the Covington and Burling offices in Washington,
D. C., November 19, 1969, Industry scientists replied to Dr. Perry Hudson’s
criticisms of the Chemosol protocols.

At the end of the day, the American Chemosol Corporation representatives,
Mr. Roche and Mr. Beck, agreed to proceed with the program as detailed in the
two protocols. It is presumed that Mr. Austen obtained the agreement in
writing. Mr. Austen requested me to notify the Industry scientific
representatives of the agreement.

Possibly the greatest area of disagreement between American Chemosol
Corporation and the Industry related to benzo(a)pyrene analyses. Mr. Cargus
stated that such analyses would be performed routinely on Control and
Chemosol-treated cigarette condensates. Mr. Beck pressed strongly for
making such data available immediately to the American Chemosol Corporation.
Mr. Austen made it clear that such data would not be released before
Hazleton’s final report was issued.

This is a good opportunity for me to express my appreciation for the
excellent cooperation and scientific competence of Dr. Burke and
Mr. Carpenter, our subcommittee colleagues. It's a shame that so much quality
work has had to be expended on something like Chemosol.

I am also grateful to the Research Directors for their cooperation and
understanding.

Sincerely yours,

Eldon D. Wieland

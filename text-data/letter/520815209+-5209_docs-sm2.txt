RE: RJR adv. State

Dear Tom:

This letter responds to your February 18, 1999 letter which was prompted by the February 10, 1999 memorandum from the Attorney General of the State of Washington to our Attorney General Janet Napolitano and eleven attorneys general. Unfortunately, Ms. Gregorio’s memo was written almost two weeks following the one and only Winston Blues Revival planned for Arizona. That event was held at the Cajun House in Scottsdale on January 28, 1999.

It is my understanding that RJ Reynolds Tobacco plans no other Winston Blues Revival concerts for Arizona.

If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

GOODWIN RAUP PC
Brian Michael Goodwin

To: Dr. F. G. Colby From: C. W. Rystrom

The following two comments made by Ernst Wynder at two different meetings in the past two years seem quite inconsistent to me.

On Page 90 of the 1980 Banbury Report on safe cigarettes, Dr. Wynder is quoted as saying:

“WYNDER This is a crucial point. If you measure cotinine-nicotine levels in cigar and pipe smokers, you find that they are as high as those among cigarette smokers. Since we know there is no increased risk for coronary disease among cigar or pipe smokers, even with their elevated nicotine levels, I wonder if you are going to study catecholamines?”

At the June, 1981, symposium on Epidemiology and Prevention of Atherosclerotic Disease in Capri, Italy, Leonard Zahn reports the following comments made by Dr. Wynder:

" During discussion, Wynder commented that smoking will have no adverse effect in the absence of arteriosclerosis. What is the factor in tobacco that can initiate a heart attack in a system already afflicted with arteriosclerosis, he asked? That’s the key question that hits at the core of efforts to develop a “safe” cigarette, he said.

Wynder said his own theory is that nicotine, not carbon monoxide, is "the culprit" because the alkaloid "perhaps" causes an increase in catecholamines that in turn have an adverse effect on a coronary system that is already damaged.

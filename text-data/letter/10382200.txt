Dear Sirs:

I am writing a book on cigarettes and cigarette smoking. I would like to
show the smokers and the non smokers how to develop a taste for cigarettes
rather than the habit of smoking; when and where one best appreciates a
cigarette, when and where not to smoke, how one can associate a certain
food or a certain wine with a particular brand of cigarette, etc.

The book will also include chapters on the different types of tobacco, the
different processes and blends utilized for cigarettes, the brands of cig-
rettes, a history of cigarettes.

I am collecting material from manufactures in USA and abroad.

Could you, please, send me all the printed informations you have about your
productions: the types of tobacco you utilize, the types of cigarettes you
produce, the different brands, the trade names, pictures or samples of
the packs, a history of the manufacture, etc.

Please, send me the material as soon as possible to the address in the
heading and charge me for any possible expense. Thank you.

Looking forward to hearing from you, I remain



Sincerely yours





Alessandro Rindi

Dear Keith:

The Institute leases 22,412 s/f of office space in Washington, DC. The base rental
for this space is $34 per s/f. Our lease expires on December 31, 2004. We have an
option to terminate the lease without penalty on May 31, 2001.

I have attached a lease buyout proposal for our Washington office space. This
proposal provides that we will be released from our lease obligations if we make a
lump sum settlement payment of $575,790 and continue our lease payments through
October 31, 1999. If our landlord finds a tenant who needs access to the space
before October 31, 1999, TI will vacate the space early and it’s rent obligation will be
reduced accordingly.

REDACTED

I recommend that The Institute's member companies accept this offer.

I would like you to present this proposal to the TI member company group that has
been dealing with institute close-down issues.

Sincerely,

Bill

William A. Adams

RE: Corporate Center of Toxicology
Weekly Highlights - Week Ending June 19, 1987

•	A review of pesticide regulations and regulatory toxicology as described in a Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) document was prepared by Mr. Robert Suber. The CAST document provides a very simplistic view of these areas without defining both the strengths and weaknesses of science and regulations. Risk assessment as currently used by the Environmental Protection Agency is only a part of the scientific data needed to interpret risk and safety considerations of pesticides. The CAST document had been prepared to explain technical aspects and to provide general background information on pesticides following the recent National Academy of Science report on pesticides and risks.

•	The minutes of the quarterly center meeting was distributed. The most recent developments of Proposition 65 in California were discussed. A court opinion requires the California Governor to list over 200 compounds which are considered animal or human carcinogens/teratogens. The recent National Academy of Science report on pesticides was also reviewed. The report provides a theoretical approach to oncogenic risks due to pesticides and suggests that EPA review/require additional data on selected pesticides. The National Toxicology Program is preparing to test limonene and black pepper in bioassays. Del Monte is currently evaluating the use of lower sulfite concentrations on dried fruit.

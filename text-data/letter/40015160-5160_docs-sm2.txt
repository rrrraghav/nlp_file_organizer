Dear Dr. McAlister

I am writing this letter to inquire about the possibility of a phase out fund for the CTR grant 2003 about the purification of the adipogenic factor. I am aware that the renewal of this application was not funded. However, since the submission of the proposal, we have made considerable progress towards the complete purification of the hepatocyte-derived adipogenic factor. If we could obtain a phase out fund of 15,000 dollars, this will allow me to continue supporting for 6 months the visiting scientist from Japan who has been carrying out this project. This will give him the opportunity to complete the very difficult but very important purification of the adipogenic factor for which he has worked so hard. Unfortunately, the Cell Science Center is going through a financially challenging difficult time so that people that would be otherwise supported in the interim by the institutional fund do not have this opportunity anymore. This will also allow us to obtain additional data so that we can write application to support the whole project. I am aware that this is a very exceptional request but because of the long standing interest of the Council for innovative research, I am hopeful that this request will be favorably evaluated. I will be very happy to provide you with additional data on the progress of the purification of the adipogenic factor if you need them.

I would like to thank you for your kind consideration in this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Cineto Serero PhD
Senior Scientist

February 9, 1995

Dear Bill:

Since I received no word from you to the contrary today before the close of business I have deduced from our telephone conversation that you do not intend to comply this Order of the Court concerning the production of the B&W documents to the Court in Jones County on or before Thursday of this week for in camera review.
Please be advised that the Plaintiff opposes any extension of time for the Defendants in the production of these documents for in camera review.

The documents at issue were requested by the Plaintiff on May 12, 1994. The Defendants have been involved in litigation concerning these very documents for a year and a half. The documents were identified and authenticated in that litigation in the deposition of J. Kendrick Wells on September 8, 1994. The Court ordered that the documents be produced on February 9, 1995. This order was not unexpected given Judge Landrum’s ruling on January 12, 1995, that he would conduct an in camera review of the documents. Any argument that B&W has not had sufficient time in which to produce or catalogue the documents is illogical at best. The failure of the Defendants to produce the documents as ordered could be construed as nothing less than another blatant attempt to delay. We therefore oppose any extension of time and the Defendants may seek and intend to request sanctions if the documents are not produced when ordered.

I also understand from our conversation today that the parties agree to establish an account to which the Defendants will equitably contribute for the purpose of compensating a Special Master when and if the Court deems it matters necessary and compliant with a Motion I have made toward this end. The Plaintiff must remain at complete ease in knowing that the Order will be followed. We will diligently pursue our efforts to see that it is complied with. Please contact me before Thursday if you do not agree with resolving this matter. Please do not delay informing me of your position any longer.

Sincerely,

Judge A.J. Landrum
(signed by hand)

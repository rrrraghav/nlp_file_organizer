Dear Jim,

We received enquiries from two individual inventors in Japan asking for any possibility to be adopted by R.J.R. of two inventions with regard to special kind of cigarette filter, details of which are mentioned in relative documents enclosed.

The two inventions were registered to Japan Patent Agency and published in their official papers.

Will you please study and examine on them at your side and respond to us your comments on these inventions.

Best regards,

Sincerely,

K. Fukuoka

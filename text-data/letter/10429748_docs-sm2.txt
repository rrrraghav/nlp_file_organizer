July 3, 1975

Dear

The Scientific Advisory Board to The Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc., in carrying out its mission to sponsor a broad program of research into tobacco use and human health, has found it useful to hold informal, unpublicized roundtable conferences on a variety of subjects. Such meetings have been held on cardiovascular effects of nicotine, psycho-physiological aspects of smoking, lung pathology, chronic respiratory diseases, carcinogenesis and many other subjects.

The Board is now planning to hold another conference focusing on areas related to the etiology and pathogenesis of chronic respiratory diseases.

The purposes of the meeting are to:

(a) appraise the present state of knowledge in relation to the overall actions of proteases and inhibitors, including such areas as activators of enzymes, the roles of macrophage and leukocyte, and particular aspects of the immunologic system, in order to,

(b) induce an interchange of ideas, develop perspective,

(c) illuminate new research arenas and conceive objectives designed to close gaps in present research efforts.

The conference has been tentatively scheduled for the period Monday, September 9th through Tuesday morning, September 9th, of this year, at The Council offices in New York City.

Your work and interests are considered significant to the general area to be discussed, and The Council very cordially invites you to attend this meeting.

We look forward, hopefully, to receiving your acceptance, and to know whether you would be willing to make a short presentation reviewing your particular investigations against the aims of the conference. Informality in presentation is stressed.

Out-of-pocket expenses will be paid by The Council.

Further information will be forwarded to you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Stanley Stone, Ph.D.

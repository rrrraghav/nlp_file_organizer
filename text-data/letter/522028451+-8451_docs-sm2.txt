Dear Dr. DiMarco:

Enclosed please find a copy of the report, "A Global Perspective on Longer-Term Inhalation Studies of Tobacco Smoke in Mammals", which was prepared by Kolbye Associates, with the assistance of Compudex, Inc., pursuant to the current contract between your company and mine.

Our report to you and your associates was organized on a geographic basis to provide further insight into the research programs at various centers. Scientific publications from the open literature dealing with chronic inhalation exposures to cigarette smoke are reviewed and reported in bolded script.

We have not provided an overview, since to do so implies an interpretation or value judgement concerning the data.

Thank you for consulting with Kolbye Associates!

Sincerely,

Aelbye

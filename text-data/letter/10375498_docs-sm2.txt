Dear Milton:

We have your letter of July 9 about Dr. F. E. Bolan
of the Cookey Memorial Hospital in Aurora, Illinois.

Our files fail to show any (1) published papers on
tobacco, (2) requests for information from any of the
usual granting agencies, (3) any public statements of view-
point, (4) any previous correspondence of any kind. Thus, he
is a complete unknown.

I can still inquire whether any of our pathologists
are personally acquainted with him, his work, professional
standing or reputation.

If you want to refer him to us, we can give some
references to the existing published literature on this subject.

Today we have the copy of your letter to Dr. Rohrbarger
and are obliged to know that a sample of smoke condensate has
been sent along to him.

With kind regards,

Sincerely,

RHM

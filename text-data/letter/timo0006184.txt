RE: Northpointe Circle I
Lease Termination

Dear Mr. Adams:

We received your letter of October 29th, 1993 and have since spoken with the Landlord of
Northpointe Circle I regarding your request to terminate the lease effective November 30, 1993
with a termination fee of $8,757.00.

The Landlord will agree to an early termination based upon the following fee amount:

Base Rent for 6 months	$ 8,215.98
Operating Expenses for 1994	1,470.91
Unamortized Tenant Improvements		
Commissions, Legal Fees	2,000.00
Interest	313.00
Total Termination Fee:	$11,999.89

This termination fee of almost $12,000.00 is $5,902.00 less than your total obligation would be
through the end of your lease term. Please let me hear from you, if these terms are acceptable and
we will have the termination agreement prepared.

Sincerely,

COHEN-ESREY REAL ESTATE
SERVICES INC.

Dear Dr. Enikolopov;

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a proposed research project has now been considered by the Executive Committee of the Scientific Advisory Board.

The Committee expressed interest in examining a more detailed plan of the proposed investigations. I take pleasure in enclosing the necessary forms and relevant literature pertaining to the filing of a formal application. The next deadline for submitting proposals is November 30, 1995.

You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this time concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on the complete proposal.

Sincerely yours,

Harmon C. McAlister

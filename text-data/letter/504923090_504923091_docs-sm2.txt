APPLIED R & D WEEKLY STATUS REPORT

BRIGHT Retail Shelf Life Study

Two samples of BRIGHT (November 1982 and June 1983) were
picked up from retail along with SALEM Ultra Light 85 (November
1982 and May 1983). Separate diagnostic tests were conducted
to evaluate the effects of aging on the two brands. The BRIGHT
products showed differences on seven of the fourteen attributes.
Of particular interest were less menthol flavor, minty flavor
and cooling sensation. SUL 85 showed differences on three of
the fourteen attributes. None of these were menthol related.
The results were provided to Brands and have been reported to
Marketing by them.

Garniture Injection

Implementation of garniture injection on NOW 100 Menthol
has been postponed due to product relocation in Manufacturing.
An AR for this change is being routed.

Reducing Casing for G-13-14

Completed MDD (M/A/R/C) tests indicated that franchise
smokers could not discriminate either test formula: (1) with
50% of the casing removed from the control on (2) with
50% of casing transferred to G-13-14 to Part II. Several major
brands were tested. Cost estimates have been requested to be
completed by July 25.

An AR proposing the 50% casing reduction on all G-13-14
has been put on hold pending a review of all G-13 projects.

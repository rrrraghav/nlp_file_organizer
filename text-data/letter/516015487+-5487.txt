Dear Madam

Re: Prune Extract TKF-52

We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 02, 1996 regarding the above subject and apologise for our delay in response.

However, with reference to the confidentiality agreement which you have brought up in the aforementioned letter, we would like to clarify herewith that this is solely an agreement between Reynolds and Takasago International Corp. (USA), and one which we perceived to be having no legal binding effect or whatsoever between Reynolds and Takasago Singapore.

Under such circumstance, we would like to propose the drawing up of a new and separate confidentiality agreement between Reynolds and Takasago Singapore, in which case further disclosure of the information you require on ingredients and formula component would then be made possible.

We hope for your kind understanding in our predicament and looking forward to an early reply regarding your disposition to this matter.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Yours faithfully,

Takasago International (Singapore) Pte Ltd

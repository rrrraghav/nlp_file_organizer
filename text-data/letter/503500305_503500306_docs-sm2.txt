Subject: VANTAGE PACKAGING EXPLORATORY

Dear Howard:

As we discussed by telephone, we are requesting that you conduct an additional phase of exploratory for VANTAGE packaging. You should concentrate your work during this phase on VANTAGE patent 85mm and VANTAGE Excel. Once this phase is successfully completed we will proceed with translations to our VAT, Ultra Lights, 100’s and Menthol styles.

As we agreed, your initial presentation to us is scheduled for 12/17. Flats as opposed to comps are the appropriate format for this presentation; however, they should have a high degree of finished appearance.

Howard, direction for this next phase does not depart significantly from that which guided your previous work. There are, however, several areas upon which you should place additional focus in order to achieve the optimal design for VANTAGE. Specifically, you should strive to:

• Increase the pack’s contemporary look.

• Provide a higher level of quality appearance.

• Inject motion and energy into the design, as opposed to a static effect.

• Maintain a strong visual link to current VANTAGE packaging.

Specific design elements which you should address include:

• Logo treatment which is more contemporary as regards typeface or position.

• Bulls-eye treatment which is less bold, more tasteful.

• Elimination of background starkness.

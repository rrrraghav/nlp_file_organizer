INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Hematology Endpoints DATE: July 29, 1986.
TO: Dr. F. H. Ayres FROM: C. R. E. Cogginz

Attached to this note you will find the raw data and basic statistics for the hematology endpoints in the 14-day CD study.

The abbreviations used in the MINITAB tables are as follows :

Group 1, machine control;
Group 2, 527 ppm;
Group 3, 1091 ppm;
Group 4, 1800 ppm.

The findings can be summarized as follows :

RBC numbers increased slightly with dose, with similar increases in Hb. There was a strong, positive association between dose and blood Ret. HCT values in females also increased with dose, with a less marked change in males. Hct values were increased by the same amount in all smoke-exposed groups.

We did not have any decrease in WBC as seen in the smoke study; the mean concentration in the low dose group was higher than the mean concentration in all other groups (both sexes). Lymphocytes and PMNs (4:) were unaffected by treatment, with no obvious trend in the monocyte data.

Dear Mrs. Rider:

By resolution approved at the meeting of the Board of Directors on

by $560,152 from $25,056,000 to $24,495,848.

Eleven installments of said dues have been paid by Class A members,
totaling $22,991,967.00, reducing the unpaid balance of dues for 1992 to a figure

The check should be made payable to THE COUNCIL FOR TOBACCO

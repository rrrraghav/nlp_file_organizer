Attention: Mr. Robert B. Walker
Chairman of the Board

Gentlemen:

I doubt if this letter will get to the Chairman of the Board, but anyway, I am a stockholder in the American Tobacco Company and received your communication of October 25th, and I frankly think the tobacco industry is hiding behind a log. As long as Kennedys can keep this as a whipping boy, they will continue to do so, and of course, it is purely for their personal gain and not the public.

I have wondered why the tobacco industry has not asked the Government why not label whiskey as dangerous to your health, and many other household items such as aspirin, etc. I have wondered why the tobacco industry did not get the producers association and different farm organizations busy on this, because it is not going to end until someone makes it politically unprofitt- able for the food and drug administration and Kennedys to make an issue of it.

I have practiced law since 1933, have had a lot of dealings with the medical profession, and in the Hell they can say that tobacco causes cancer, when they do not know what cancer is, is beyond me, but at any rate, it is a popular subject. I remember twenty years ago, when if a person had a bellyache he was automatically operated on for appendicitis, and that fad has blown over with the medical profession. Also the tonsillectomy for all children has blown over. I well remember when the medical profession said that Blue Cross would destroy the nation, and now they are the greatest believer in it, and it has enhanced their earnings. Also

To reconfirm your guest room rates, they are:

Singles/Doubles @ $150.00 +CAP

Your meeting room rental is $50.00 per day.

Bob, if you would, please sign the bottom of the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to my office as soon as possible to act as confirmation of the above and as an amendment to our Contractual Agreement dated March 8, 1982.

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you:

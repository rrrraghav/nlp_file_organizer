Ref Japanese Patent Appln. No. 66,648/64
U.S. Serial No. 577,069
Case 144 - Roberts

Dear Dr. Senkus:

We remind you of our letter of March 14 in which
we pointed out that we are restricted to only one claim in
the subject Japanese patent application. We have instructed
our associates to file a claim for a process of improving
tobacco by adding thereto the specified additive.

We can, if desired, file a divisional application
directed to the process of preparing the tobacco additive.
If a divisional application is to be filed we should do
so within the next several weeks. May we please have your
instructions in this matter?

Very truly yours,

PENDLETON, NEUMAN, SEIBOLD & WILLIAMS

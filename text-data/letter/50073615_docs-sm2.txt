Dear Mr. Hoyt:

I am enclosing five copies of an application
for a grant so that each of the members of your
Committee can have his own copy. If, for any reason,
you prefer having this application written on your
particular blanks, I will be glad to do so.

I would appreciate knowing the approximate time
I might expect a decision concerning my application.

Sincerely yours,

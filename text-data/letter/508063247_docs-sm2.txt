INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

No. 93327-Doy

August 25, 1989

To: Mr. D. N. Iauco

Subject: Puff Count Strategy

Please find enclosed two sets of documents: Puff Count Summary and Key Brand Style Puff Count Strategy, which outline our proposed action plans, timetables, and the costs to achieve competitive puff count parity on 32 brand styles. The cost impact is projected to be approximately $21 million, which is primarily associated with increased tobacco rod weight.

We are working against an aggressive time frame with MAGNA receiving top priority. The longest lead item in the implementation process is smoker recruiting for product testing. Improvements on all MAGNA styles are scheduled to be in market by 1st qtr., '90, and the majority of products identified for improvement in market by mid-year, 1990.

Dear Dr. Lajthe:

On the 10th and 11th of June 1985, The Council For Tobacco Research will be holding a one and a half day symposium in our offices entitled, "The Role of Receptors in Biology."

As a CTR grantee whose research interests are in some way associated with receptors, we cordially invite you to participate in this conference. No formal presentations by grantees are planned. Further, The Council will be pleased to defray your reasonable travel and living expenses while in attendance at the meeting. Since most of you will require accommodations, we have had a block of rooms held for us on the nights of June 9 and 10 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. This is just a few blocks from our offices. If your spouse accompanies you, CTR cannot defray their expenses, but they may stay with you at the Waldorf at a cost to you of $20 per night.

Since attendance is limited, please let us know as soon as possible if you plan to attend. Also, if you attend, please let us know if you will be staying both nights at the Waldorf.

The meeting will be held in the offices of The Council on the 4th floor of 900 Third Avenue, between 54th and 55th Sts. This is one block from the Lexington Ave. E train (8th Ave.) and F train (6th Ave.) subway station.

This promises to be an interesting conference—as you can see from the enclosed program, and I hope you will be able to attend and participate in the discussions with us.

Sincerely yours,

Dan Ford

Dear Dr. Kabat:

I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder JL. Am. J. Epidemiol. 142(2):141-8, 1995), and noted a logical inconsistency that likely indicates a minor error.

Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in childhood as 0.90 for “yes” (i.e., any exposure), 1.12 for “1 smoker in the household,” and 1.13 for “≥2 smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes” should be some weighted average of the ORs for the subcategories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is, unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe, be incorrect.

I calculated crude ORs and CIs from your published case and control counts for each exposure category and was surprised to find that the crude results for “yes/no” identically replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142 that “unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2 contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state if the results in Table 2 are, or are not, adjusted. Your calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household” was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2.06) and for “≥2 smokers in the household” was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.31-2.43). These calculated crude subcategory results are logically consistent with the published Reynolds’ results.

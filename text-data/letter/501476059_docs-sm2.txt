Dear Mr. Nishimura:

It was a pleasure having you visit RJR on your busy schedule through the U.S. It was especially gratifying to have several RJR management members meet a long-time friend of our Company and to engage in the helpful exchange of information on cigarettte manufacturing. You represented JTS very well.

During your visit, the question was asked about RJR’s response to U.S. government request for list of additives used in cigarettte manufacture. This is a very sensitive matter and one which at this writing is still unresolved. However, we can say that the U.S. cigarette manufacturers have negotiated an agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services whereby the industry will disclose substances commonly added during the cigarette manufacturing process and HHS has agreed to treat such disclosure as CONFIDENTIAL under the Freedom of Information Act.

I am pleased to enclose a photograph taken during our lunch together. Standing are Mr. Ingram, Mr. Montgomery, Mr. Sisel, Mr. Christopher, Mr. Isbister and me. And you will recognize Mr. Stewart seated. I am sending the photo to Mr. Ishii and Mr. Yamada also.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,

Raymond C. Smith

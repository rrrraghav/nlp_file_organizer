Date: March 5-8, 1996
Location: Borrego Springs, CA

Dear Dr. Chait:

The Scientific Director and CTR’s staff have discussed your request for partial support of the conference named above. The program contains topics of interest to the Council, and the list of speakers ensures the scientific quality of the meeting. I am pleased to inform you that we will make a contribution of $2,000 to help defray, in part, the costs of the conference. A check for the noted amount, payable to The 1996 Deuel Conference on Lipids is enclosed for your attention.

It would assist in our record-keeping if we could have a written acknowledgment of the contribution. We request only that these funds not be used to reimburse expenses incurred by participants from the industrial sector...

Sincerely yours,

George A. Hashim

Re: Toplines of Menthol
Migration Study: Interleaved
vs. Direct Application

Background/Purpose:

The Menthol Developmental Group is exploring the direct application of menthol
onto the carbon sheet as an alternative to the current interleaving process
(1). The level of menthol migration to the fuel source is one of the criteria
by which this decision will be made.

The Shelf Life Group assisted by evaluating and comparing menthol migra-
tion to the fuel sources of products incorporating the interleaving vs. tha
direct Application processes.

Procedure:

Cartons of Menthol Alpha 8040A (Interleaved) and 8040B (Direct) were
exposed to 75 F and 120 F conditions for five days. Menthol determinations
of all components were made at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days. An informal sensory test
was performed at Day 5.

Results and Discussion:

As shown in Attachment 1, results from this study suggested menthol migration
to the fuel source is greater for products incorporating the interleaving vs.
direct application processes when these products are exposed to either 75 F
75 F or 120 F conditions.

However, it is known that the base sheet used to make 8040 had a lower carbon
activity than the sheet used to make earlier successful prototypes, 802C and
8012B. In order to achieve a similar menthol load as the tobacco paper plug
used in these prototypes, 3 days of interleaving were required (vs.
2 days for 8040A). This resulted in excessive free menthol which would be
available for migration and possibly bias the results of this test of direct
vs. interleaving processes. Therefore, this study will be repeated with the
next lower carbon activity base sheet.

Next Step:

This study will be repeated w/o 7-18-88 using products containing tobacco paper
plugs with 17% Carbon (with an activity 4.4 gms./sq. meter)

The previous test outlined in Carpenter, Menthol Development activities, ION,
June 10, 1988, will be followed as normal.

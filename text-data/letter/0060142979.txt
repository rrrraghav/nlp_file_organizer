Dear Norm,

We have been requested to analyze Museum Magazine.

Editorial.

Museum Magazine is devoted entirely to art, history and science museums of the world. It is a full-color, high quality publication covering the most extraordinary collections from these 24,000 museums.

Each issue of the Magazine contains articles by leading curators of art, science and history museums, collectors and connoisseurs and by authors and personalities whose particular interests make them authorities on the museum-related subjects they write about.

Each issue also includes coverage of new discoveries, auctions, book reviews, previews of special collections, schedules of traveling exhibits and world-wide museum tours.

Demographics

Mark Clemens Research, Inc. conducted a Charter Subscriber Survey for Museum in 1980. Findings (See Attached) indicate that the publication has slightly more women readers than men (51.9% vs. 48.1%), a median age of 48.3 and a better educated, up scale audience.

Efficiency

Museum is a bi-monthly and has a circulation of 120,000. The 4 color page cost is $2.50, delivering a CPM of $20.33. This efficiency was one of the lowest of all magazines proposed for Carlton during 1982 "Magazine For The Eighties" (See Attached).

Cordially,
Jota H.
John T. Hughes
Vice President/Media

RE: 1995 Processing Specs

The enclosed General Processing Instructions have been finalized and are for your review. The changes
discussed at our May meeting have been incorporated (in part) and will be applied to the 1995 crop year.
The discussion at the meeting was well received and the following are some noted changes from the 1994 crop
year:

a) Reduction of the target on “Pan” in the lamina. (1.00 to 0.90)
b) Revising stem reporting to not include fiber.
c) Reducing Target on OBI’s. (0.40 to 0.35)
d) Placing "Upper Control Limits" on the total stem and OBI.
e) Placing “Upper Control Limits” on moisture content.
f) Emphasizing stem length.
g) Incorporating a foreign matter check.

We feel the changes will enhance the quality of our products for the 1995 crop year. Any further
discussion on any of our processing procedures is welcomed.

Dear Bob:

Enclosed is an advanced copy of the Washington State retail package produced by The Tobacco Institute to help retailers comply with state law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors. Full quantities are due the press tomorrow, February 17, and can be ordered, free of charge, by your various members by filling out the enclosed order forms. You will note you can even receive extra order forms if necessary to supply your entire membership.

I understand you need some signs for immediate use, so I have enclosed the remainder of the green signs we prepared for just such requests during the interim while the full packets were being produced. Future packets will comprise the finished materials.

Thanks for your interest in participating in this important program. Please feel free to call me at the number listed above if you have any questions about the materials or the ordering process.



Sincerely,




David B. Hooper

Dear Dr. Ford,

As per your suggestion yesterday, I am sending you this note to inform you of my intent to resubmit my proposal entitled "Splenic Fibroblast Subsets Mediate B lymphocyte Survival", for the November, 1994 deadline. I am appreciative of the encouragement you provided. While my proposal did not achieve a fundable priority score, the reviewers were nonetheless very enthusiastic about the project. I know I can improve it substantially by November.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely yours,

Bick Phipps

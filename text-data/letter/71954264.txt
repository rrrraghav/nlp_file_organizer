Dear Ms. Zinowski:

Re: Payments by Brown & Williamson under the Master Settlement Agreement

This will confirm the allocation of the payments made today by Brown & Williamson under the Master Settlement Agreement.

Brown & Williamson is sending to Citibank the following amounts by wire transfer:

$40,825,455.48 for credit to the Section IX(c)(1) Account
$41,795,903.39 for credit to the Disputed Payments Account

These amounts are based on the “Final Calculation” dated April 11, 2000 by the Independent Auditor under the MSA. By making these payments, B&W is not conceding the appropriateness of these amounts or the correctness of the calculations underlying them. B&W specifically reserves the right to dispute any portion of the amounts it is paying today, regardless of how those payments are designated.

Very truly yours,

Neil E. Mellen
Senior Counsel, Product Litigation

Flavor Support for SALEM

Products, in the SALEM KS and SALEM Light 85 styles, were
made by Brand R&D using cavity filters containing various
levels of menthol laden polymer beads. At their request,
menthol formulations of cut filler application were designed
to simulate the same menthol deliveries as the above
prototypes. Calculations for these tendering are based
on the analyses obtained from the menthol content in the
tobacco and the polymer beads. An aging study will be
conducted by Brand R&D on the comparison of these two menthol
products: mentholated beads in filter versus mentholated cut
filler. It was also recommended to Brand R&D that a
comparison of puff-by-puff smoke menthol profiles is
essential information if a true delivery of menthol against a
time basis is to be understood.

Re: Distribution

Dear Bob:

Quite rightly, you people have been interested in the question of distribution on Sir Walter Raleigh products as we plan Sir Walter Raleigh brand strategies.

The table attached, prepared by Laura Amshoff, provides us with information we haven’t had before.

In general, it shows that distribution is in pretty good shape on Aromatic within those sales departments where the spring flight will run. It also confirms our belief that New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are disasters. Chicago is mediocre; Frank Sonogo (Department Manager) has already, on his own initiative, worked with me to develop plans for improving brand distribution. His area stretches from central Indiana out through Quad cities.

While distribution, like advertising, can always be improved, I guess, it seems to me that our advertising will be reaching areas this spring where consumers can reasonably expect to go out and find Aromatic at their favorite stores. PKG’s nicely designed promotion brochure will be a good aid for plugging the distribution gaps where they do exist.

Sincerely,

Mike
Michael McCue

Dear Hack,

CCF invoices A65-460 and A65-461 were sent to Mrs. White this month.
The following is additional information on the two billings:

Invoice A65-460: $105,872.00 Phase I

The Huntingdon charges of $81,872 consist of $70,762 corporate engineering costs and $11,110 of plant engineering costs. The corporate engineering charges are primarily design engineering with the remaining charges for project management and C.A.D. systems. Plant charges are primarily process design.

The Granville costs represent manhour and travel costs of the process design team. ($14,000)

Invoice A65-461: $134,000.00 Phase II

$29,000 of these costs are for mat development, while the remaining charges ($105,093) are development costs for the long term process. All of these costs were incurred by our Granville technicians.

Sincerely,

OWENS-CORNING FIBERGLAS CORPORATION

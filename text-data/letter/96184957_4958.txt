Dear Mr. Tisch:

The undersigned represents the California State Lottery (the “Lottery”) which is a California state agency established pursuant to Chapter 12.5 of the California Government Code under the authority of section 19 of article IV of the California State Constitution, as amended by an Initiative Measure approved November 6, 1994. The Lottery is authorized by the State of California (the “State”) to conduct, promote, advertise, manage and control a lottery.

This letter concerns your "point of purchase" and other advertising which has been disseminated in Orange County and other locations in California utilizing your “Newport” and “Kent” logos and prominently displaying the words “LOTTERY TICKETS SOLD HERE.” The copyright symbol clearly identifies your company as the owner of these materials. A photocopy of each of these advertisements is enclosed with this letter.

The Lottery has expended substantial sums of money and extensive effort in advertising and promoting lottery games for the profit and benefit of the State, in general, and California’s citizens, in particular. It spends many millions of dollars each year to establish and protect its “Good Will” which is defined by California Business and Professions Code section 14100 as the "expectation of continued public patronage.”

The Lottery is most seriously concerned with protecting that Good Will and does not want to be associated with tobacco products or to imply that it is in some way sponsored by or affiliated or connected with your company.

The subject advertising campaign is misleading to members of the general public in that it implies a connection, affiliation, sponsorship or association between the California State Lottery and your company.

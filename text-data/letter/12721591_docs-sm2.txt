Re: Carlton Filter King-Size Box
Paint Completion Report/January, 1982 Repaint

Dear Norm:

The attachment lists the completion dates for the January, 1982 repaint in the LCA markets.

January creative for all but six units is: "U.S. GOV'T REPORT": (Black lettering-angled left corner) “Carlton is lowest” (Red lettering) “Today’s Carlton has less tar than the version tested for the Government’s 1981 Report.” Despite new low tar brands introduced since, Carlton still lowest. Box—less than 0.1 mg. tar, 0.4 mg. nic. (Black lettering). Pack pictorial is the Carlton Filter King Size Box.

Six bulletins are displaying the "U.S. GOV'T REPORT" line in a horizontal position because of the dimensions of the units.

Extreme weather conditions in various markets have precluded the outdoor advertising companies from complying with our leeway date of January 15.

We are compiling a book of all the photographs and will forward it to you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Cecilia Levin

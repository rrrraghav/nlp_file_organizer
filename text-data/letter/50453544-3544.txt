Dear Dr. McAllister,

Enclosed please find a preliminary proposal titled "Colon Cancer and MHC Class I Genes" for research support from The Council for Tobacco Research. I have also included a biographical sketch with bibliography and reprints from three recent publications which are directly relevant to the proposed studies.

I thank you for your consideration of these matters.

Sincerely Yours,



Sebastiano Gattoni-Celli, M.D.

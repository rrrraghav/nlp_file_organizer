RE: WINSTON Packaging Focus Group

This forwards for your review the Brand’s perspective on the WINSTON packaging focus groups held in Tampa on May 11 and 12.

Background

The objective of the groups was to evaluate franchise and competitive smokers' perceptions of pack designs developed for Project Eagle. Focus groups had been held previously (March 25, 26) in Atlanta to identify owable elements of the current packaging that could be leveraged or refined. With this direction, Kent Plutsmark developed new packaging designs for WINSTON. It was a selection of these refined designs that were tested in Tampa. The information from these latest groups will be utilized by Brand to provide further developmental direction in the development of a design for quantitative testing and test market introduction in 1/88.

Methodology

Two franchise and three competitive focus groups were held:

* Male WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old
* Female WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old
* Female Marlboro smokers, 21 - 34 years old
* Male Marlboro smokers, 28 - 27 years old
* Male Marlboro smokers, 28 - 34 years old

Current packs were evaluated against five new concepts. Four of the new designs were close to current packaging while one was “further out” design was very similar to large a change was acceptable. One set of packs had identical designs in the Full Flavor, except a black vs. a red logo. Another set of packs had the same design in the Full Flavor, except one was current WINSTON red while the other was a Marlboro red.

Implications

* Change is acceptable to the franchise. Overall the franchise groups reacted very favorably to new designs. In fact, more radical change than would seem prudent was viewed positively by the franchise groups. The bottom line seems to be that WINSTONS’s appeal is essentially tied to the pack package itself as aptly expressed by one participant: “WINSTON would still be WINSTON to me even if they wrapped them in a brown paper bag.” The major concern expressed by the franchise was market recognition. WINSTONS want to be able to quickly recognize and pick their WINSTON;

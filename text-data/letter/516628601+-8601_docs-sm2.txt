RJR Interoffice Memorandum

Subject: Records Destruction Notices Date: March 14, 1984

To: Ms. Loren McManus From: Robin E. Warner
RJRI Legal Records Management

Attached are Records Destruction Notices for records which
are now stored in the Records Center for the Corporate Employ-
ment Department and the RJRI Personnel Department.

I have also attached a memo from Mr. George Cook of the RJRI
Personnel Department stating that these records are on micro-
film and no longer need to be kept in hard copy. Therefore,
we are asking for your permission to destroy the hard copy of
the records listed on the attached notices.

At the present time, the records are now being destroyed by
the department after the records are microfilmed and are not
being sent to the Records Center for storage.

Please sign and return the Records Destruction Notice to me.
I will then forward it to the Tax and Comptroller’s Departments
for approval.

I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. If
you have questions, please call me at 773-2949. Thank you.

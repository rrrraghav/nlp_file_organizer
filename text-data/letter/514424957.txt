INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

ANALYTICAL COMPARISONS:
SUBJECT: PACK TEST vs. TRAGON U DATE: OCT. 16,1987

TO: R. B. HEGE FROM: R. O. WAGNER

The 50cc/30sec. smoking date from cigarettes made at Bldg. 631 for an October PACK TEST iie "KS-3", "Gww-RS”, and “UL-IA” indicate similar deliveries when compared with past smoking data obtained for similar products tested on Tragon Test U.

Analytical data indicate a difference in delivery for PACK TEST product "JB-9" when compared with previous data. A nicotine delivery of 680 ug was found rather than an expected delivery of 580 ug. Approximately 100 ug of this 200 ug difference may be explained by a slight difference in substrate loading. (Analysis shows percent nicotine of the "JB-9" substrate to be 0.493 vs. the target of 0.537). This loading difference, 0.042, is judged to be within an acceptable range.

Smoking of “JB-9” by informal panelists, project leaders, and the product sponsor indicate good strength, impact, mouth feel, and consistent taste through out.

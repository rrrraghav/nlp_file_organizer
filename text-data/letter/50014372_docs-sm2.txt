Dear Fred:

I am certainly grieved to learn of the passing of Dr. Frundlander.
He was a fine person and I had become very fond of him. I shall miss
him tremendously in a very personal way.

We are hoping that the changes which must inevitably occur on
account of his loss will not alter your opportunities to continue your
work along the lines that interest you most. The backing of Dr. Furst
will probably be of great advantage.

I am indeed much interested in a very personal way in the effects
of vitamin A levels on the responses of strain A mice to smoke inhalation.

Various things have been happening, researchwise, and some of
these suggest changes in emphasis or offer possible new avenues of
approach. This is the main reason why your letter announcing the most
recent renewal of your grant proposed that a general discussion be held
with a sort of taking of stock before its expiration date arrives.

We must certainly arrange for you to come here to sit down at
leisure for an adequate discussion with members of our board and staff,
or for such a delegation to visit you in San Francisco. Let us plan
definitely to do this in late September or early October. I will
probably be due for a round on the west coast about that time.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

RCH/bw

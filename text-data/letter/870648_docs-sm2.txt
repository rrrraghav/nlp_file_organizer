Dear Mr. Keniston:

Thank you very much for your letter concerning our FACT advertising. We believe that the phrase "We sell only FACTS" is a factual statement. Our feeling is that it does not portray the proper conviction that our copy must convey. In order to personalize the choice of brand to the individual, we have chosen the line “I’m realistic” and “I only smoke FACTS.”

Since the subject of the advertisement is FACT cigarettes and only FACT cigarettes, it goes well beyond the mere suggestion that these are the only 6500+ models that we enjoy our brand of cigarettes. Our objective in this advertising is to make the advertisement appear to receive exactly the intended impression in the consumer’s mind. We want them to form an informed judgment on his brand of cigarettes and not choose to smoke any FACTS. Our feeling is that the American public has come to understand over the years that advertisers typically assume “poetic license” in order to convey their selling messages and we feel it is important for us to make a clear distinction between advertising use of language and the exactly proper grammatical construction.

Again, thank you for your letter and we hope that, if you are a smoker, you will try FACT cigarettes and find that they deliver atypically good taste for a low tar cigarette.

Sincerely,

C. T. Reed
Senior Brand Manager

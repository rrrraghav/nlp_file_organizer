Dear SWAT:

Thank you for your recent letter on the issue of youth smoking prevention. As you pointed out, we have a shared cause: preventing the use of tobacco by teenagers and children. In this spirit, we are pleased to be invited to continue our dialogue on issues related to youth tobacco use.

I am happy to be able to report progress on our part both in sponsoring programs to prevent youth smoking and in tightening controls over marketing programs to be sure they are not directed toward youth.

First, here is a description of a few of the programs my company is sponsoring through organizations dedicated to helping kids. Our aim is to provide funding and encouragement to these organizations to initiate and measure a variety of youth smoking prevention programs. If the programs are successful, we will then work to help expand them to wider groups of children and teenagers.

All of these programs are based on the idea that building social skills and social resistance skills are among the most successful techniques in preventing youth smoking because they address root causes. Researchers have demonstrated that peer pressure, resistance skills, communication skills, decision-making skills, self-esteem, assertiveness, and responsibility all work together to help kids avoid temptations and dangers.

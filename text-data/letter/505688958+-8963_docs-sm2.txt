SUBJECT: 1983 CAMEL/SALEM Resort Evaluation

BACKGROUND

The Spring Resort Program has evolved over the past several years, emerging as a complex field marketing promotion that involves the prime process in a variety of lifestyle events. The 1983 program represents our most interactive effort, integrating field marketing and selective sampling to build store awareness and generate optimal brand presence. Several unique approaches were developed for the 1983 effort.

The 1983 Spring Resort Program was sponsored by CAMEL and SALEM in an attempt to reach the young adult male smoker and the younger adult coolness segment. A total of 1,144 gratis packs of CAMEL and SALEM were distributed in eight markets from March 5 through April 1. In contrast, the 1982 program utilized 6000 packs. Due to the complexity of 1983 execution, multiple suppliers were involved. While the 1982 program was executed by a single agency, the 1983 promotional thrust was scheduled simultaneously at Daytona Beach and Ft. Lauderdale as compared to past years when major promotional elements were executed separately.

The primary elements of the 1983 CAMEL/SALEM Spring Resort Program are as follows:

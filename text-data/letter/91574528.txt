Dear Sir:

Please note that on the enclosed check we have deducted a
20% credit from the invoice for ads that ran in the PRESS AND DISPATCH
on September 6, 10 and 13. The ads in question were backed by
coupons even though we specifically stated on the insertion order
that this was unacceptable.



Lorillard Media Services has always held that an ad backed by a
coupon does not receive full advertising value. After discussing
the situation with our agencies and newspaper representatives, we
agreed that a 20% credit was indeed fair.

If you wish to contact me concerning this situation, please call
me at (212) 841-6869.



Sincerely,





Stephen M. Molley.

Dear Dr. Taylor:

The Scientific Director and CTR’s staff have discussed your request for partial support of the conference named above. The program contains topics of interest to The Council, and we list of speakers ensures the scientific quality of the meeting. I am pleased to inform you that we will make a contribution of $2,000 to help defray, in part, the costs of the conference. A check payable to FASEB in that amount, together with a copy of this letter, was forwarded to the attention of Adele Hewitt at FASEB.

It would assist in our record-keeping if we could have a short written acknowledgment of the contribution. We request only that these funds not be used to reimburse expenses incurred by participants from the industrial sector.

Sincerely Yours,

George A. Hashim

SUBJECT: ATTACHED MEMO

EXAMINE DISTRIBUTION

The attached memo identifies why the decline of Coolness brands and Menthol's among FUBUAS is a critical issue... Quite simply, it is a direct threat to the long term potential of SALEM, our #2 brand. Unless we have a clear understanding of the reasons for the Coolness decline among FUBUAS; it is hard to develop strategies that will allow us to capitalize on the opportunity. SALEM can address the reason for the decline.

Joan has listed the most plausible hypotheses and I think that most of them can be screened using existing information. Perhaps some custom tabs on marker will be needed.

Given the significance of this issue, especially for SALEM, we do need answers. Before proceeding; I think we should come to an understanding about who is going to do what. The SALEM group is looking at this question and there may be others.

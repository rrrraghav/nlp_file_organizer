Mr. Robert Strauss
Special Representative,
Trade Negotiations
1800 C Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20506

Dear Mr. Strauss:

There are certain trade policies of the Japanese government
which discriminate against imported cigarettes which we
believe you should discuss with Japan. We urge you to
put these policies on your agenda for your forthcoming
meetings in Tokyo and if necessary carry the matter
into the Tokyo round of multinational trade negotiations
in Geneva next year.

We are a major United States manufacturer of cigarettes
which we export to many international markets, including
Japan. We can sell in Japan only through the Japan Tobacco
and Salt Public Corporation (“JTS”), an arm of the Japanese
Ministry of Finance. Our sales of cigarettes would be
many times larger in Japan were it not for policies practiced
by JTS which restrict the marketing of our cigarettes and
place our products at a disadvantage as compared to Japanese
domestic cigarettes. It is our understanding that the
policies apply to all imported cigarettes and to that
extent we speak for other U.S. cigarette exporters as
well. We shall describe the discriminating policies in
more detail.

JTS applies a quota to all imported cigarettes which
limits the total number of imported cigarettes allowed

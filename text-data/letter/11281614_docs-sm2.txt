Gentlemen;

About 10 days ago I had written a letter to the American Tobacco Company making a suggestion relative to the turmoil cigarette smoking is making with regard to lung cancer. They suggested to me by their letter of August 17, that I address my remarks to you people.

The question put to me was "why wasn't any propaganda regarding all the effects of cigarette smoking." At the present the cigarette companies are stressing various filters to eliminate to some extent the harmful substances of contents. My question was as follows: some years ago and prior to World War 2, through the manufacture of the cigarettes the tobacco had glycerine as part of the tobacco mixture. During the war the government requisitioned all of the glycerine produced, as it was required and used in the manufacture of gun powder or some other materials of which glycerine was necessary. In the old days cigarettes did not burn anywhere near as fast as they do today, there was no throat irritation then and there were naturally no complaints against cigarette smoking.

I am a cigarette smoker, I do not inhale. I do not smoke cigars and rarely smoke a package a day. While typing this letter I it smoking one of the 100’s Marlboro cigarettes. I puffed on reflexively and also placed it in my ash tray between the existing sequence. It finally down to the tipped part and it took only 10 minutes. So now where does a certain cigarette claim a 7 minute cigarette. I usually smoke the 100's of Pall Mall, Winston and L & M.

I mention the above so that you will know what I have been smoking. However I call your attention to the glycerine part of my letter and thought I might call your attention to this phase of protection. You people in the research department can answer this.

Yours truly,

Harry H. DuBoff

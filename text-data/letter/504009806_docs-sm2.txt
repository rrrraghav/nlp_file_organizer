Re: Effect of Aging on Cigarettes
Containing Added Ammonia

Confirming our recent discussions, Dr. Senkus plans to conduct
a study to determine the effects of aging on the chemistry of
WINSTON “A”. He will obtain fresh product from the factory and
product from the market of various ages and have them analyzed
for the following components:

Ammonia in tobacco
Sugar in tobacco
Formaldehyde in smoke
Acrolein in smoke
Pyrazines in smoke
pH of smoke
Tar
Nicotine in smoke

As a parallel to this study, we will have the same analyses
made on 2600-D product stored on the shelf and in the various
accelerated aging chambers. At the conclusion of these studies,
we will meet with Dr. Senkus to compare results and draw any con-
clusions that may be indicated.

Dear Gary:

The "major anti-smoking events" chart in Ken Warner's dreadful New England Journal piece is not as comprehensive as I remembered. I recall a chronology of sorts done by the HHS’ Office on Smoking and Health and shall ask our library to run one down and mail it to you.

“Tax Burden” will tell you more than you’ll ever want to know about excises. I've marked the federal tax rate table and a chart that shows the per capita bit better than Warner does. I know you hope to plot against quarterly consumption data, but I’m also enclosing our card with USDA data on annual consumption back to 1900.

Note from the page 2 chart in “Tax Burden” that the heaviest growth in state tax rates were 1978-80 and 1982-84.

I hope Jack Maxwell can help with quarterly consumption. He may not have quarterly data as early as 1964, but he has reported quarterly as long as I can remember.

This will be dispatched to you Tuesday. I shall return from vacation on the 15th and stand ready to help any way I can in your research.

Cordially,

Annue

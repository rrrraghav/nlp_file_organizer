Dear Len:

Thank you very much for your letter of 11th February
and I will be delighted to have lunch with you
on the Wednesday, 2nd April. I will be staying
at the Pierre, arriving the night before. Could
you get in touch with me there or leave a message
for me so that I know where to meet you.

Kind regards,



Yours sincerely,

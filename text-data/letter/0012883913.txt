Dear Mr. Lodwick:

Thank you for your recent correspondence concerning CARLTON Cigarettes. We regret the delay in responding to your first letter.

The formulation of CARLTON, and of any other cigarette brand, is considered to be proprietary information and is therefore confidential. While we must decline to respond specifically to your questions, I can assure you that there are no ingredients in CARLTON that have not been in wide use in many other cigarette brands. Generally, such additives comprise flavoring ingredients and humectants.

The principal factors contributing to CARLTON’s low-tar level include the tobacco blend and the air-stream filter.

We trust that we have been responsive to you.

Sincerely yours,



H. W. Bahrenburg
Product Manager

Your interest in the Company is appreciated.

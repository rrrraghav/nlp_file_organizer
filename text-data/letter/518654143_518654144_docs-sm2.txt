New Stores -- Remodel Stores -- Relocations

Please be advised that corporate Revco stores are going through a change in their merchandising concepts and store decor. This letter will identify to you, through the attached Revco merchandising notification form, whether this store is a new store, store remodel, or relocation. Please handle installations as requested, and contact Revco in store personnel regarding setup details.

Display concepts have been approved for not only R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, but also for other tobacco companies. Attached you will find plan-o-gram layout type "R" for new prototype stores. We will be shipping you the number of units needed to complete the permanent counter display concept for this particular store.

Please be advised that we have entered into no agreement to allow Revco the opportunity to increase their contract with new stores for a selected period of time. Therefore, please enter volume plan as follows:

Type: One (1) FPD, Plan A -- As volume increase please adjust contract plans based on volume. However, we will be monitoring the time period in order to remove the contract plan if it does not meet volume guidelines within a reasonable period of time.

Under Revco’s new concept we will be utilizing RJR's cartridges attached to Revco’s own shelving, utilizing four complete shelves for packages to be placed directly underneath Revco’s new valence. This concept will be 9, 10, 11, or 12 ft in width (identified on Revco’s merchandising notification form).

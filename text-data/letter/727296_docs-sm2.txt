Excise Tax Matters

Dear Mr. Ravlin:

Thank you for the copy of your memorandum dated August 4, 1967 which was brought to my attention upon my return from vacation.

Mr. William E. Duffy, our Tax Manager, will serve as Lorillard’s representa-
tive on the informal committee. I would suggest that your Mr. Bryant contact Mr. Duffy directly in arranging for the first meeting of the committee. I understand that Mr. Duffy will be attending a tax conference in Denver later this month and that might be an appro-
priate time for the meeting.

Sincerely yours,

PRG; vp

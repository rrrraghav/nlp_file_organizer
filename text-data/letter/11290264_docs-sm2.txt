Dear Sir:

I wrote to different tobacco companies about my idea of
tobacco being connected with cancer. I am a full believer that
some type of vaccine--or shots is the cause of cancer. This
vaccine is stronger than the disease you have and gets into your
veins, which immunes you to that particular disease. My theory
is that this vaccine lodges in your veins, after maybe a period
of years and causes a sore, which turns out to be cancer. It
happens in any part of your body.

We have people to die with cancer that has never smoked and
people to die with old age that did smoke, with out having
cancer.

Get a smear of the sore or cancer and test it with the
different vaccines.



Yours truly,
Lacy Oldham

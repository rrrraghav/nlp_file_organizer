INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

TO: Doug Young FROM: Jennifer Bailey
RE: Web Gathered Cigarette Technology DATE: August 12, 1992

As I mentioned to you earlier, I am very interested in the web gathered cigarette technology as a means to improve cigarette quality. Areas of interest include the following:

o Improved cigarette rod uniformity
o Enhanced consistency
o Elimination of loose ends
o Elimination of stem holes
o Incorporation of additives such as calcium carbonate to control burn rate & ash formation
o Flavor addition

However, I realize this technology is in its exploratory stages of development and requires additional testing and refinements before we can consider it as a replacement for cut filler.

As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/cigarette-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel guide) and feed the cut filler to the periphery, we may be able to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette technology sooner than originally projected.

In essence, this approach could provide incremental improvements to our current products while minimizing the risks associated with a wholesale change.

I look forward to discussing this approach with the team at the next meeting and appreciate your interest and support.

Attention: Mr. Calary

Dear Mr. Calary:

When visiting with Mr. Kent Crouch last week, I
mentioned that we had one pallet of 29622 plug wrap
in which the porosity would vary past the tight side
(450 sec/100 ml./sq. in.) of specifications and we
would like to have his appraisal of influence on
sealing. Mr. Crouch was agreeable to our including
this pallet in a forthcoming shipment.

We plan to ship this pallet April 15 against your
order 71-08273-00. The pallet will be sent to thesty
attention of K. O. Crouch and marked "SPECIAL POROSITY -
HOLD FOR TEST". At the time of shipment we will advise
you shipping details.

Your cooperation in making this evaluation is sincerely
appreciated.

Sincerely,

John Thompson

National Manager -

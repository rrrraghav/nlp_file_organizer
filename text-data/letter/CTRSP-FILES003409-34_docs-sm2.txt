Dear Mr. Hoyt:

Enclosed is a copy of a manuscript on smoking and EEGs which
resulted from greatly appreciated help from the Tobacco Research
Council.

I am also including a copy of a popularized version, in case you
have any use for it.

If you would like any further reporting on this project, I will
be most happy to do what I can.

Thank you for your generous assistance.

Sincerely yours,

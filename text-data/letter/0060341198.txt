Gentlemen:

For many years I was retained by the American
Tobacco Company as a consulting chemist.

Due to various intra-organizational matters,
this arrangement was terminated.

I am therefore free to accept one similar
retainer from another cigarette manufacturer.

My almost thirty years of acquaintance with the
cigarette industry and my high professional standing may
possibly make this of interest to you. If such is the
case, I shall be very glad to call on you at your con-
venience to discuss the matter further.

Very truly yours,

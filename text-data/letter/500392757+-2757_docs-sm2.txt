Mr. T. E. Miller
Dear Tom:

SUBJECT: Carlton 70mm Filter with 1 mg. of tar
and 1 mg. of nicotine

I have checked a number of jobbers in town,
and find that American seems to be shipping
3m shipping cases from their Durham, N. C.
plant by UPI.

Most of the Carlton 70mm seems to be sent to
American’s main pick up jobbers, approximately
one 3m case per salesman.

I also checked with P. H. S. Tobacco Company
in Houston. They were shipped one 3m case,
American salesmen do not normally pick up
from this jobber.

I have not seen any point-of-sale material
on Carlton 70mm, nor have I seen any distribution
on the trade. American Tobacco salesmen are
selling them, but it is very low key, and
certainly far from the normal effort of
an introduction.

Sincerely,

Bie

W. E. Hern

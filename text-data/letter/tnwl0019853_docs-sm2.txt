Dear Kurt:

This letter of thanks is long overdue. On behalf of the 4800
companies in the Building Industry Association of Washington, we
are grateful for your support of Initiative 602, the tax rollback
measure on the ballot this November.

We appreciate your assistance in obtaining contributions from
within your industry. Needless to say, those contributions
financial and otherwise -- have allowed I-602 supporters to run a
professional campaign.

This next 30 days will be interesting as we battle the big
government spenders and the liberal media.

Throughout this battle and in future skirmishes, we will fondly
recall your personal efforts and the contributions of those in the
tobacco industry.

Sincerely,

Tom McCabe
Tom McCabe
Executive Vice President

Thanke Kurt!

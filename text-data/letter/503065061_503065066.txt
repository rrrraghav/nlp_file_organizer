SUBJECT: EVALUATION BE MORE YOU FASHION EVENT

DATE: May 6, 1982

This forwards the evaluation for the Be MORE You Fashion Event that was
executed at Eighteen mall locations from February 26 - April 3.

I. Overview

When judged from an overall perspective, the program was extremely
successful. The program met objectives and as a bonus succeeded in
generating substantial amounts of incremental publicity, i.e., PM
Magazine filmed and broadcast the event in Detroit. Additionally,
the event aroused a great deal of interest in the fashion trades as
was evidenced by responses from Vogue, Glamour, Better Home & Gardens
and Bloomingdale's.

Although sample delivery fell short of the plan, it is felt that delivery
can be significantly improved by tightening mall selection criteria for
future programs.

II. Objectives

A. Generate increased levels of awareness and image enhancement
opportunities for the Brand through a lifestyle program.

B. Provide the Brand with environmental trial opportunities which
compliment the event.

III. Strategies

A. Sponsor a major seasonal fashion event at upscale shopping malls.

B. Associate the contemporary fashionable image of MORE Lights with
a leading fashion publication.

C. Deliver materials and items that carry Brand and high fashion
identification.

D. Sample MORE Lights 100’s, both styles, prior, during and
following the event.

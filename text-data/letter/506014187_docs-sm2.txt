Dear Dr. O'Connor:

I have cut and pasted the most relevant abstracts from what was left of the search on ultrasonic extrusion after ordering several papers which seemed most relevant.

There was much redundancy; I have tried to select descriptive, representative abstracts that represent the whole.

In brief, ultrasound applied appropriately to a forming device (press, extruder, drawing device, etc.) does have a measurable positive effect upon a forming operation. This effect may be: decreased friction (increased die life); increased extrusion speed; better surface appearance; better uniformity; or combinations of these, taken so that the product is better when ultrasound is used then when it is not present.

I’m sure there are trade offs among these several effects, and I'm also sure that the effect upon the quality and economics of forming the fuel source must be evaluated for the project at hand.

The attached four pages of abstracts will give the reader a feeling for this applied technology, most of which dates from the 1960’s and 70’s but originated in the late 50’s.

I hope this abstraction of abstracts is helpful.

Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. King:

I really enjoyed the opportunity to speak with you concerning our youth non-
smoking program at the NUMBA convention. Keeping cigarettes and alcohol out
of the hands of kids is a major goal for everyone, and we appreciate your
interest in working with us to accomplish it. Please review the enclosed
brochure and fill out the back page to receive free materials that "Support the
Law."

If you have any questions or if I can be of further assistance, please call me at
(910) 741-5098.

Sincerely,

Micha D. Suggs

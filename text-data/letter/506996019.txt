SUBJECT: Weekly Highlights for August 8-19, 1988

VRP ASH IMPROVEMENT

Reference cigarettes and one new test cigarette are in preparation. The test cigarette wrapper is VRP paper treated with sodium silicate for improved ash strength. The reference cigarette wrappers are treated to produce cigarette ash with different strengths and colors.

LOW SIDESTREAM TEAM SCREENING STUDIES

Chalk samples and samples of the Kimberly-Clark (K-C) base papers used to produce all fifteen samples for the Screening Study arrived this week. Analyses will be conducted on all samples to confirm K-C measurements. Additional data that may be used to correlate RJR Phobos permeability readings with Coresta permeability readings made in Roswell has been received along with a more complete tabulation of the characteristics of the base and treated papers prepared for the Screening Study (basis weight, permeability, chemical level, filler level).

The first set of Screening Study samples was produced in the R&D Plant on August 24-26, 1988. All products were prepared on the 6-8 maker and had a 20.0mm finished circumference. Six prototypes were prepared with K-C papers; the remaining prototypes were made with Kimberly-Clark papers. Constant tobacco rod packing density at a high end a low level was achieved with blends containing 10% and 90% expanded tobacco. All samples were produced successfully at target weight and circumference.

Given the complexity of the experimental design, successful execution of this portion of the test is a great accomplishment. It is largely due to the care exercised in setting ranges within the experimental design (the work of T.A. Perfetti), excellent cooperation from all staff in the R&D Plant, and the outstanding effort, expertise, and diligence of Mr. William Lane and Mr. Wayne Nelson in making the products.

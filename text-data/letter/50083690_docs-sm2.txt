Dear Doctor Massaro:

At the recent meeting of our Scientific Advisory
Board, your application for a research grant was discussed
at some length. The scientific merit of your work was
recognized and the importance of its continuation acknow-
ledged; however, in view of the many meritorious proposals
for scientific studies now pending before the Board and the
several scientific areas which have as yet received inadequate
attention, it is their judgment that current funds should be
committed in other directions.

The action of the Board in this instance does not
in any way prejudice their consideration of any new proposal
that you may wish to submit.

If you wish to discuss current priorities in the
Cornell’s program, I suggest that you communicate with
Dr. Robert C. Hockett, Vice President.

Through our letter of December 29, 1970 we authorized
a time extension of your previous project 485R2, from December 31,
1970 to February 26, 1971. The Board has now approved a further
extension to June 30 with permission to retain and utilize un-
expended funds, estimated at approximately $10,899.66 as of
January 1, for the purposes of the study as originally approved.
We trust that this extension will be materially helpful in
rounding out that study.

Sincerely yours,



W. T. Hoyt
Executive Vice President

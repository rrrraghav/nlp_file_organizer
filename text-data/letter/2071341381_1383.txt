RE: Third-Party Tobacco Outdoor Advertising

Gentlemen:

The National Association of Attorneys General Tobacco Enforcement Committee is writing to give you general notice under the provisions of the Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”), of a recurring problem involving third-party tobacco advertising, in the hope that you will work towards eliminating those occurrences. This advance notice is provided consistent with our agreement to attempt to work together to avoid litigation over such issues and is intended to obviate the need for the Settling States to give you specific notice which would then require you to take specific actions under MSA Section III (Permanent Relief), Subsection (j) (Limitation on Third-Party Use of Brand Names).

As you know, the permanent elimination of all Outdoor Advertising as defined in MSA Section II(j) is a focal provision of the MSA. It is an important component of States’ efforts to reduce youth exposure to the lure of tobacco, which is of great public importance. For these reasons, violation of the Outdoor Advertising prohibition, in any of its variations, will be the subject of swift and strict enforcement measures by this body and individual Attorneys General.

Dear Mr. Jodl:

If available without too much trouble, I would like to get clippings
or any other material on the Second International Symposium on Cancer
Detection and Prevention, held in Bologna, Italy, April 9-12, 1973,
regardless of whether or not it deals with tobacco.

Sincerely,

Frank C. Colby

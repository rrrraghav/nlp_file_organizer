Re: 1995 lobbying activities of the Tobacco Institute

Dear Ms. Clemente:

We are requesting that the Lobby Commission investigate whether an egregious omission in lobby disclosures for 1995 was made by the tobacco industry, its trade association and their lobbyists. Information made public as a result of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the State of Missouri against cigarette manufacturers provides alarming evidence of a tobacco industry campaign to kill tobacco control legislation in New York State.

According to the 1996 budget of the Tobacco Institute, the trade association for the wholesalers, an expenditure of $279,700 was made in 1995 for something designated as the “New York State Representation Plan.” This item is reported on page 3-17 in the 108-page budget. The line is assigned to the National Headquarters "Special Projects" Account. The budget provides spending by line item for 1995 and includes 1995 spending figures, apparently for comparison purposes. In light of the fact that this entry appears in a document dated October 27, 1995, which provides budget as well as estimate entries for 1995 spending, indicates that the monies identified were actually being spent. (A copy of the budget document is attached hereto.)

The $279,700 expenditure for the “New York State Preemption Plan” is reported separately and appears to be in addition to routine lobbying expenses reported on pages 3-10 and 4-1, and in addition to other expenditures including donations to associated business organizations, campaign contributions and professional fees.

Preemption by the state of laws and regulations enacted by local government is a primary strategy of the tobacco industry as it attempts to frustrate and overcome efforts to regulate the use and marketing of preemption. It is alleged that the Tobacco Institute sought to preclude the enactment of more stringent tobacco regulation at the local level, thereby undermining the efforts of towns and cities to protect the health of their citizens.

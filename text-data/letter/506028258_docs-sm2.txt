RE: Second Generation DATE: September 3, 1986

Information is attached with regard to Evolutionary and similar revolutionary second generation programs. Both programs are revolution in that they target low cost CO and glass replacement as key objectives. The Revolutionary program additionally seeks to simplify manufacturing, while the evolutionary program targets product development around designs that are consistent with first generation manufacturing concepts.

Abbreviated action plans are provided for each product concept. Certain dates involving other departments were assumed based on usual time frames. These dates are, therefore, subject to approval and agreement.

As you will notice, there are a multitude of product concepts. This number will probably expand even more before it begins to focus on key opportunities. Decision dates are, therefore, built into the plans, where possible.

The thing that becomes most obvious in reviewing the product concepts is the need for (1) good and innovative consumer research and (2) a sound and, perhaps, entrepreneurial business perspective to realize the greatest possible profit potential from the unique technology that we now possess. This technology provides the opportunity of developing a wide variety of smoking products where the profit potential is immense. It is critical that this technology be married to an innovative consumer research program that is capable of identifying market opportunities for non-traditional smoking products.

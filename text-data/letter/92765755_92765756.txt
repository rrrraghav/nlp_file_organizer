The Honorable Mitch McConnell
United States Senate
120 Senate Russell Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator McConnell:

Thank you for your letter of February 12th regarding Philip Morris’ announcement of their suspension of imports of burley and flue-cured tobacco for use in their domestic cigarette blends along with your urging Lorillard, Inc. to make the same announcement.

I think you are aware of the Lorillard resources of time, energy, will and intellect committed to the development of a market-oriented tobacco program that the Tobacco Reform Act of 1985 finally realized. You may not be aware, however, that from the moment of those beginning discussions many months ago -- before argument, before compromise, before draft legislation, before the bill -- from that moment to this day, Lorillard has acted in ways of complete consonance with the spirit and the thrust of that legislation. However, I can not characterize our plans, quantify them, if you will, prospectively. There are both historical and legal reasons I can not spell out for you our actions and plans even if by so doing business benefits and political benefits would accrue to my company.



LORILLARD, INC.

Mr. Donald Smith, President Joint
Friendly’s Ice Cream Corporation
1835 Boston Road
Wilbraham, MA 01095  (413)-597-2700

Dear Mr. Smith:

As the Chief Executive Officer of a major fast-food corporation, you have a tremendous opportunity to work in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency on an important environmental health issue – secondhand smoke. As you know, the impacts of secondhand tobacco smoke - especially in children - are now documented as significant. I hope you will join your colleagues in making New England the region of the country that shows the way for public health issues.

You can assist directly by adopting no smoking policies in all of your restaurants. This single act would make a substantial impact – both in the health of your customers and in setting an example for others in your industry.

EPA has classified Tobacco Smoke (ETS) as a known human carcinogen. EPA has also documented that ETS causes between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children resulting in between 7,500 and 15,900 hospitalizations each year. Not only does ETS aggravate symptoms in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children, but it also causes thousands of non-asthmatic children to develop the condition each year.

The service and quality you offer in your restaurants attracts the segment of our population which is most vulnerable to secondhand smoke: teenagers and young children. Please consider this request and help us reduce the threat of secondhand smoke on all your customers, especially the young and most vulnerable.

I volunteer the support of EPA to assist you in obtaining this goal. Thank you.

Sincerely,

John DeVillars
Regional Administrator

RE: Change in Under 21 Readership for JANE Magazine

Dear Rita:

This provides you with the background information that you recently requested explaining the drop in JANE’s reported under 21 readership. We recently reported that our under 21 readership was 2.3% based on the JANE Subscriber file (women only) matched to the national database housed at Centrobe for the characteristic “Date Of Birth.” (A 45.8% match rate was realized at the Respondent level, with 190,510 matches out of 416,235 records found.)

In October 1998, Nancy Brannigan-Painter of Fairchild Publications, Inc. reported our under 21 readership as 12.8% using the JANE Subscriber file and a different fulfillment database. That information was recorded at the Head Of Household level. Unfortunately, it discovered that the data reported was for under 25 rather than under 21—accounting for the significant difference in readership. We no longer do business with this fulfillment company and, therefore, we cannot ask them to re-run the old report for under 21.

Again, I apologize for the confusion on this point, but I firmly believe that the issue has been resolved. I expect no great fluctuations in the future. As always, all of us here at JANE thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,



Howard Grier

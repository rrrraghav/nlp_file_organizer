•	An analysis of mean, actual and natural attribute ratings among 18-34 year old PP NN and FF LT NM smokers was conducted for the WINSTON brand research group to provide background information for the revised WINSTON product action standards. Although no statistical significant differences were run for this rating summary, the following similarities and differences are apparent:

•	The PP NN 85mm female smokers appear to want a somewhat less strong, less harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste than the male counterparts. However, all of their product ideal ratings in relation to their actual product ratings are in the same direction as the male category.

•	The FF LT NM 85mm female smokers also appear to want a less stronger, less harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste, as well as an easier draw. However, the female and male actual ratings are diametrically positioned in relation to their ideals on strength and tobacco taste. Specifically, the females want a less strong tasting cigarette with slightly less tobacco taste, whereas the males want a stronger tasting cigarette with significantly more tobacco taste.

•	A review of open-end responses from a recent Project SM Product Guidance Test was conducted to provide insight and ideas for the development of a new chewing tobacco questionnaire. Results indicate that respondents cite many quality of flavor and aroma attributes which are not piped on our current questionnaire. Many respondents mentioned fruit flavored, 
tobaclo flavor, artificial taste, sour taste, licorice taste and sweet aroma. Additionally, many respondents cited burning and biting sensations from the tobacco, indicating a need to further explore the mouth feel dimension of the product.

•	Preliminary results of the FF LT Tar Limit Study were presented to Applied R&D. Additional analyses are planned based on the conclusions reached from preliminary results. Maximum ratings for overall acceptance are associated with high tar dilution. In general, greater than filter pressure is studied, air levels is of much importance in response variables in affecting attribute movement. Shape surfaces for strength, tobacco taste, rich taste and natural taste all line along similar side for overall acceptance measures, with maximum ratings close to moderate to low air dilution irrespective of filter pressures. Strength related attributes appear to be driving contours

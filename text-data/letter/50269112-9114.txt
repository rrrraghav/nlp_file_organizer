Dear Dr Hockett:

In a recent paper D. Yoshida and T. Matsumoto of The Japan Tobacco
Monopoly described the isolation and identification of two mutagenic
agents, amino-α-carbolines, from cigarette smoke condensate
(Cancer Letters 10 (1980) 141-149, see attached copy).

One of those compounds, amino-α-carboline, was found to range
between 25 ng/cigt (flue-cured) to 134 ng/cigt (Burley) and 258 ng/cigt
(Japanese domestic tobacco), or between 5 and 10-fold the usual
concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene in smoke condensate.

The contribution of amino-α-carboline to the mutagenic activity of
cigarette smoke was stated to be appreciably higher than
that of benzo(a)pyrene.

Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the enhancement of the mutagenic
activity of amino-α-carboline by norharman, which occurs in cigarette
smoke condensate in amounts of up to 10 µg/cigt.*

The cigarette smoke constituents harman and norharman are β-carbolines.
β-carbolines, like α- and β-carbolines, are formed by tryptophan- or
protein-pyrolysis, and they are also suspected to be possible con-

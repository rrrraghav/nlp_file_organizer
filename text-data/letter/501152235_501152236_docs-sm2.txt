Dear Ray:

The R. J. Reynolds corporate schedule in Redbook Magazine is now the equivalent of 23 national pages which qualifies all advertising for the 16 to 25 page discount. This discount is 17% for advertising placed in issues January through June and 19% for advertising scheduled from July through the end of this year.

It would be to the advantage of Reynolds to consider scheduling at least one more page 4-color insertion at a cost of $19,519 which would make all advertising scheduled for this year eligible for the next discount level, 24 to 30 pages, thus earning a 25% discount and a rebate of $14,461 re-
sulting in a savings of $27,9/2.

To take advantage of this opportunity Reynolds would have to schedule the additional page insertion in either the November or December issues since the closing date for October has passed. WINSTON and VATTAGE are both scheduled for the November and December issues thus SALEM or DORAL would have to be allocated for the page insertion. SALEM is presently scheduled for the December issue, while MORAL is not scheduled for either issue.

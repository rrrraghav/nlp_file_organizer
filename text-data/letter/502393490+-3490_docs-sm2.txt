Dear Sirs:

In the course of our studies in Health we have come across
a controversially question. Does cigarette smoking
cause lung cancer? We have chosen to have a debate
on this question.

As I was appointed to speak on the side defending
cigarette smoking, I thought your company could provide
me with some helpful information. I would appreciate
very much your reply. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Wanda Spease

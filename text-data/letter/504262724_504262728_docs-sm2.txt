Alternate Puffing Methods: Pentane Batch Processor

Purpose:

To compare tobacco that was not puffed, tobacco processed through the continuous FC-11 system, tobacco processed through the pentane batch processor, and tobacco processed on the pentane porous belt, and to evaluate the C-13 pentane batch processor.

Summary:

C-13A from the same lot we processed through the continuous FC-11 system at No. 601, through the pentane batch processor, and the pentane porous belt. Cigarettes were made using tobacco from each process and unpuffed C-13A, and using the WINSTON LIGHT 864 blend containing the four C-s13A types as replacement for regular G-13A.

The cigarette weight reduction using the FC-11 processed tobacco was greater than either pentane method, using 100 percent C-13A (44 vs. 38%). Weight reduction of the tobacco rods using the blend was 7.6 percent for FC-11, 6.1 percent for batch, and 7.5 percent for the belt processed C-13A. Draft was much higher for the FC-11 processed C-13A than for the pentane processed tobacco. Chemical analyses showed higher nicotine loss and lower sugar loss for the belt method than the FC-11 or batch. TPM, "Tar", and nicotine in the smoke were lower for the FC-11 process than either pentane method. Essential oils analyses indicated that the pentane batch process was less severe, the FC-11 process was intermediate, and the pentane belt process was most severe. Smoking panel evaluation did not reveal superiority for any process over the other.

The pentane batch processor requires two hours cycle time and pressures approaching 90 psia to produce tobacco puffed about equivalent to that produced in the FC-11 continuous process. The pentane batch puffing system is technically feasible; the liquid jet evacuation system does not appear to be. The system would be labor intensive and present safety hazards.

Recommendations:

If pentane investigations continue:

1. Study the feasibility of a continuous belt system with remote control.

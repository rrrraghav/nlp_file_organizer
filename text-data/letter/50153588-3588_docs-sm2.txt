Dear Dr. Green:

The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc. is pleased to offer
a renewal grant in the amount of $65,000 for the period from January 1, 1983
through December 31, 1983 for the study proposed in your application dated June
26, 1982.

We recognize that this appropriation is somewhat less than your request
but hope that it will suffice to maintain the study at a productive level. If you
wish to accept it, please notify us accordingly and submit a revised budget to show
how the available funds will be distributed. Forms are enclosed for this purpose.

It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by the
institutional authorities, as heretofore.

It is made without guarantee of support beyond December 31, 1983. We
recognize, however, that your application proposed a study extending beyond that
period. Therefore, a renewal application supported by a progress report will re-
ceive consideration in competition for available funds, if submitted for July 1, 1983.

Your attention is particularly called to the enclosed "Important Procedural
Information for Grantees".

Dr. David Stone, Associate Research Director, will continue to represent
our scientific staff as primary contact with your grant. He will be the person to
consult about any questions or problems that may arise, and should be kept informed
about the progress of the study.

Please fill in the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to
me.

Sincerely,

R. F. Getterback
Robert F. Getterback

Encls.

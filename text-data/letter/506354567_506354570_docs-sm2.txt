SUBJECT: ETS Pilot B DATE: March 16, 1988
Schedule (Draft)

Pilot B has been tentatively scheduled from March 25 through
April 8. There are three primary objectives for this study.

1. To determine if rinsing the mouth prior to cotinine collection
influences the concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in urine
and saliva.

2. To rehearse the revised protocol, since the revisions include an
altered sampling schedule for urine and saliva and two groups of
subjects per day.

3. To determine how the new smoking regime influences the ETS
chamber parameters and nicotine/cotinine concentrations in
biological fluids.

SCHEDULE:

The pilot will consist of 4 subjects in two groups (A & B). The
subjects will be recruited by Bellomy Research.

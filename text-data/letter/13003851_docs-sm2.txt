Dear Marcel

Identification of Fake Viceroy Products

I am frequently called on to identify products that have either been seized by HK Customs and Excise Dept. or are sold people in China. Sometimes this is easy when it is a bad fake but the fake manufacturers are becoming more sophisticated as they earn more money and invest some of this in better product.

One of the things that I have noticed is that there appear to be 2 different styles of die print on Viceroy KS cigarettes (Large Shield design). One print has less width and a hook on the downward limb of the “R” the other print style has a very small scuff by comparison. All other aspects of the packaging and cigarettes seem genuine to me.

With kind regards, could you confirm to me whether you are or have been running two different die print styles on export Viceroy KS. If yes, do you plan to continue this practice or standardise on one style?

If you have only one print style, are other companies authorised by B&W to manufacture Large Shield KS Box and SC with a different die print? My thinking is that it could be a parallel product that is leaking into the market.

With kind regards

Yours sincerely

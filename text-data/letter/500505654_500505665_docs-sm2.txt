SUTTON SMOKING MATERIAL

In August 1967, personnel from the Sutton Research Corporation, Santa Monica, California displayed four sets of cigarettes to COMPANY personnel. One of these sets (70-mm. filler rod, no filter-tip) contained a non- tobacco filler, the so called Sutton material. The other three sets (70-mm. filler rod plus 20-mm. Estron filter tip) contained 1:3 tobacco blend:Sutton material, 3:1 tobacco blend:Sutton material, and the tobacco blend alone.

A Sutton material cigarette on smoking burned much like a tobacco cigarette, gave an ash which behaved and looked much like tobacco cigarette ash, and produced smoke which had a very bland taste. This bland taste persisted even when the cigarette was smoked to a relatively short butt length.

Analysis of the Sutton material cigarette smoke indicated that it was as low as or lower than tobacco smoke in respect of the concentrations of those components considered harmful to the smoker by some authorities. The components of interest include nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanide, acetalde- hyde, acetone, acrolein, phenol, carbon monoxide, and certain polycyclic hydrocarbons. Despite the fact that these analytical data were derived from a number of cigarettes much smaller than usual, the results were encouraging.

After negotiation and signing of an agreement between the COMPANY and Sutton Research Corporation on December 6, 1967, Mr. T. S. Briskin, President of SRC, and Dr. Geoffrey Ward, consultant to SRC, described to COMPANY

Dear Dr. Wakeham:

Enclosed you will find a receipt for the recent check in the
amount of $25,000 made payable to North Carolina State
University. The check is being deposited in the Agricultural
Foundation as custodian to be used in the construction of the
phytotron.

We would like to express to you our most sincere appreciation
for this generous contribution toward this worthwhile facility.
I am sure it will pay handsome dividends when it becomes
operative.

Many thanks for your interest and financial support.

Sincerely,

R. W. Shaffner
Director

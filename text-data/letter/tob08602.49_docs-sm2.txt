Dear Ms. Blaumstein:

We have received our shipment of “Helping Youth Decide,” and wish to thank you for your prompt and generous response. We have already begun to distribute this brochure to a community group that is holding a Family Life Institute soon. In March, we will be distributing it to parents who will be attending our Parent Networks Conference. This is just a beginning. We will surely share the opinions of others about the brochure as we become aware of them.

For ourselves, it produces a very positive reaction. The material is very pertinent to our programs and “constituents.” It is intelligently and attractively presented. We are enthusiastic about distributing this quality brochure.

I hope we will be able to contact you again once our supply is depleted.

Sincerely,

Anita L. Schanback
Project Coordinator, Parent Networking

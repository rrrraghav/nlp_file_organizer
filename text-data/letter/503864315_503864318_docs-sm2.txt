RJR INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE

June 11, 1984

To: Mr. G. H. Long
From: Bob Di Marco
Subject: Technology Driven New Products Reporting Structure

Jerry:

Currently, the reporting structure for Project TSB consists of multiple committees and task forces. At the bottom level is a working team composed of representatives from various departments who are charged with the responsibility of coordinating day-to-day details of the project. This group reports to the TSB Task Force currently chaired by Bob Lloyd. The Task Force, in turn, reports to a Steering Committee composed of Huddall Christopher, Harry Lees, Dale Sigler, and me. This Steering Committee was originally charged with coordination of domestic and international efforts on TSB/TGA. Recently, a Worldwide Coordination Committee has been formed to coordinate RJR, RJII, and McCann-Erickson efforts to introduce a brand based on TSB technology. The current TSB structure is outlined on the first attachment.

A second project, TGA, is now beginning to develop a similar structure. While coordination across departments is necessary, too much of it exists on TSB, and a similar phenomenon may be expected with TGA. Attachment 2 outlines a plan to replace the TSB structure and incorporate a reporting system for TGA and the other technologically driven new product projects as well.

Features of this plan are as follows:

0 The current TSB Steering Committee and TSB Task Force will eliminate. RJR Executive Officers will continue to receive reports on TSB and other new product projects.

0 RJR/RJII/ McCann-Erickson efforts on TSB will continue to be coordinated through the Worldwide Coordination Committee.

0 New Products’ Steering Committee will be formed to deal with both TSB and TGA. Permanent members of this Committee will include RJR representatives of R&D, New Brands Marketing, Marketing Development, Process Technology and Development and Law. Each

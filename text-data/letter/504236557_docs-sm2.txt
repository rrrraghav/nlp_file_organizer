Dear Andre,

I have now managed to sit down and organize the two projects which we are to offer for PIL work with the Smoke/Technology Groups. I thought you would like to have details to be able to present a more detailed programme at the meeting in Florence.

1. Nitrogen sources and nitrous oxide in smoke

We will have tobacco from three sources of nitrogen, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate and urea. This is a properly replicated trial so we can give them up to ten replications.

2. Effect of sucker control compounds on leaf quality

We can supply up to four replications of cured leaf treated with n-decanol, octanol decanal mixtures,
Prime Plus (cypermethrin), Bud Nip (chlorpyrifos),
Accotab (pendimethalin), Tamex (butrolin), FST-7
(n-decanol plus potassium salt of maleic hydrazide)
and several others.

From both these trials we will have yield and quality figures and this could be supplemented by any figures from Smoke group. Our tobacco will be available at the end of April 1984.

I hope this will be useful in presenting your case in Florence.

Yours sincerely,

L.T.V. Cousins,
SENIOR AGRONOMIST.

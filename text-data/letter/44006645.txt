Dear Norma:

Mr. Hassett is out of town (and I assume Mr.
Dwyer might be traveling, too).

I just talked with Mr. Jack Lewis of our area
Grocery Manufacturers Representatives. They
would definitely be interested in hearing Mr.
Dwyer but they do not meet in the summer months.
Should another visit in the September through
May period be scheduled, by all means contact
Mr. Lewis. The group consists of several
tobacco products people and interested general
membership and they would welcome a presentation
by the Tobacco Institute.

Very truly yours,



Diane
Secretary to Mr. Hassett

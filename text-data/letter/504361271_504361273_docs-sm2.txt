Discussion:

• The NFO test results from the prototype tests, FT-3775-C & D, were presented and compared to the January In-Market and the October Marlboro presents. A significant improvement in preference was realized only results. The team was advised among the 18-24 year old male competitive smokers. that Marketing has recommended a change in the primary action standard from 25-34 males to 18-34 males. Among the 18-34 male competitive smokers, both prototypes represent parity products. Marketing is recommending introduction of prototype C. 7+ and attribute ratings are attached for both franchise and competitive smokers.

• Attribute ratings from the last four NFO In-Market tests on WINSTON KS, going back to the first 1982 Competitive Product Test, were reviewed and compared to 3518-A and 3518-B. 7+ and attribute data are attached.

FT-3518-A: WINSTON KS "A" cut filler was ordered from Manufacturing. Cigarettes were made and packed in the R&D Plant .

FT-3518-B: Modified WINSTON KS blend with increased casing level that scored a 59 on NFO. Product was blended, made, and packed in the R&D Plant.

One common factor among all 10W scoring (49-53) WINSTON products was shorts, whereas prototype 3518-B was made without shorts. Lynn Dube is investigating further to determine the result of consumer acceptance regarding shorts addition. She will report at the next meeting.

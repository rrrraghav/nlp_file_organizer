INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM

Subject: Strp & Cut Filler Processing
Committee - Meeting Minutes Date: March 1, 1984

To: Committee Members From: H. C. Threatt

The group previously calling itself the “Maximizing Acceptable Cigarettes per Pound” Committee met February 29, 1984. Those attending were Hoyt Beard, Jim Dickerson, Wayne Pulp, Bobby Hardin, Floyd Lockamy, Don Lamonds, John McKenzie, Jim Phillips, Dan Pugh, and Harold Threatt. The agenda for the meeting is attached (see Attachment 1).

I. Previous Meeting Minutes

There were no changes to the minutes of the last meeting.

II. Project List

The committee discussed the updated project list, a copy of which is included with these minutes. Several good points were made for improving the list:

• Clarify ST (short term) and LT (long term)
• Place date on the list
• Update in time to have a newly revised list for each meeting
• Number the pages.

The group felt that several areas not presently involved should receive copies of the list – Leaf Hurting, Leaf Processing, and Facilities Development, for example. Copying the leaf and blends Subcommittee members will be a big help in getting proper distribution.

Actions required in maintaining the project list are:

1. Corrections/changes need to be sent to Harold Threatt by March 14.
2. Latest corrected project list to be sent to committee members by March 21.
3. Committee members should come prepared to address any errors at March 28 meeting.

III. “Maker” Projects From Manufacturing Engineering

Don Lamonds attended the meeting for the first time. The committee felt that it would be good to include projects in Manufacturing Engineering having to do with maker improvements. Don will provide these for addition to the list. His projects are mainly related, but they fit the criterion because of the reduction in the number of rejects, etc.

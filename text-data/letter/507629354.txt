Dear Mr. Gezmetner:

I am writing you regarding the growing criticism and movement developing toward divestiture of investments in tobacco companies by public and private pension funds. Harvard University and City University of New York are the most recent examples of pension funds deciding to divest their holdings in tobacco companies. As you are aware, much of the criticism is aimed at minors’ use of cigarettes. Indeed, federal surveys indicate that 90 percent of smokers start before 21, with 50 percent starting under age 16.

As holders of $25 million of RJR Nabisco bonds and potential equity holders through KKR, we would like to know what steps, if any, RJR Nabisco has taken to keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors. Since it is illegal in Michigan and other states for minors to smoke, the state’s five pension funds, representing some $90,000 current and future retirees, have a responsibility to support compliance with the law.

As a responsible corporate citizen, RJR Nabisco should be committed to the welfare of this nation's youth. We strongly urge you, if you are not already doing so, to use some of your $1 billion cigarette marketing budget in the United States to educate and protect children and teenagers from the hazards of smoking and to make vending machine cigarettes unavailable to them.

Hopefully, RJR Nabisco has already implemented programs to address our concerns in this area. Your response to these concerns is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Robert A. Bowman

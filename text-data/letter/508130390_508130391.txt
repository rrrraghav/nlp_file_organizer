RJR Interoffice Memorandum

SUBJECT: Meeting on the Metzenbaum DATE: October 25, 1983
Amendment to Restrict
Importation of Foreign
Tobacco

TO: Distribution FROM: D. P. Johnson

A meeting was held in Raleigh October 19, 1983, among technical representatives of the major tobacco manufacturing companies. The purpose was to compile lists of pesticides used on tobacco in foreign countries and to determine the use status of those pesticides in U.S. tobacco production. This information was requested by Mr. Horace R. Kornegay for use in dealing with the Rose and Metzenbaum amendments requiring certification that pesticides "cancelled or suspended" in the U.S. were not used on tobaccos imported into the U.S. The Raleigh meeting, which was chaired by Dr. Preston Leake of American Tobacco Company, was attended by Ms. Leslie Lewis and Mr. D. P. Johnson of R. J. Reynolds.

Wording in the amendment has been changed slightly since it was first drafted. Originally it would have forbidden importation of tobacco that had been "exposed" to pesticides which have been cancelled or suspended for use on tobacco in the U.S. The current wording would require certification that “none of the pesticides, the registration of which has been cancelled or suspended for use on tobacco in the U.S.” – has been used in the production of tobacco offered for importation into the U.S.

Exposure to pesticides would be very difficult to avoid since some of the pesticides that have been suspended have accumulated in soils, and due to their long half-life, will remain there for years to come. Furthermore, use of the word “exposure” would imply zero tolerances for residues of the suspended pesticides, and this could be practically impossible to achieve. The new wording appears to be much more realistic.

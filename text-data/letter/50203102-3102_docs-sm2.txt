Re: Our Case No. 268

Dear Dr. Chernick:

Your recent inquiry concerning support by this Council of a proposed research study has now been considered by the Executive Committee of the Scientific Advisory Board.

The Committee expressed substantial interest in your proposal and voted to encourage formal application by you. I take pleasure in enclosing the necessary forms and relevant literature.

We appreciate your interest. You understand, of course, that no commitment is implied at this time concerning the final action of our full Scientific Advisory Board on your complete proposal. If I can help you in any way in your development of an application, please let me know.

In order to be processed during our next cycle (for grants to begin July 1, 1974) an application would have to be postmarked no later than January 31, 1974.

Sincerely yours,

RC:High Robert C. Hockett, Ph.D.
Research Director

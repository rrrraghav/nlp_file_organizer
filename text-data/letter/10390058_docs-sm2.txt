Mr. Tom Jones
Adams Letter Co.

Dear Tom:

Please reproduce the enclosed note and release and mail as quickly as possible to my lists:
Z-8 and Z-9

Also, have envelopes typed from the attached list to get the mailing.

The blue pad note can be stapled to upper
left hand corner of the mailing.

I don’t need extra copies of the release.

And please hold onto the list in the event
of another mailing soon. No need to plate it as
yet. I may have something else to go next week.

Many thanks.

Sincerely,

Leonard S. Zahn

Dear John:

Thank you very much for the generous donation to my
campaign which you forwarded to me from the Tobacco Institute.
I have very much enjoyed working with you in the past and look
forward to working with you in the future.

I am glad to see that you have moved into the neighborhood
and hope that all is going well now that you are living here in
Platte County.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,

Gary Witt

Dear Mr. Hoyt:

I am writing to request financial support in the amount of $ 20,000 for a two-year study, which is outlined in the enclosed research proposal "Selenium in Tobacco Smoke".

If the Council agrees to fund this project, please send any checks to the UCSD Foundation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, Calif. 92093.

We would like to receive these funds in two equal installments over the two year period. I would appreciate it if the letter accompanying the first installment were to state that "these unrestricted funds are presented to Dr.G.N.Schrauzer to support programs under his direction".



Yours sincerely,

G.N.Schrauzer

G.N.Schrauzer
Professor of Chemistry

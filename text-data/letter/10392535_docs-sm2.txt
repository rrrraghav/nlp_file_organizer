Dear Len:

Thank you so much for enclosing that exceedingly interesting paper by
Martenson, Larsson and Zettergren dealing with malignant mesothelioma
in siblings. It is of interest that cases one and two are both epithelial
types of malignant mesotheliomas. Finally, and most extraordinary, in
cases three and four, both were biphasic tumors and the dominating
fibrous component. The latter were identical twins. This, of course,
supports our hypothesis of genetic specificity related to the
histologic form of mesothelioma. This is very timely indeed in that we
have a paper (enclosed) in press in Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics.
This project or one was supported by NIH. I will let you know when it
is published which should be very shortly since I returned the galleys.

Things are moving slowly, but hopefully, steadily with respect to HCI.
Sincerely,

Henry T. Lynch, M.D.
Professor & Chairman, and

Dear Senator Patterson:

On behalf of The Tobacco Institute, I am pleased to enclose
herewith our contribution for your re-election campaign.  The
Tobacco Institute recognizes that good citizenship includes
involvement in the political process and giving support to
legislators, such as yourself, who give full and careful
consideration to all sides of an issue.

Accordingly, after consultation with our legislative counsel,
Dean Morgan and William Fritz, we are delighted to offer our
support.

Sincerely,

Alexander H. King

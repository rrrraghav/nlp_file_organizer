Dear Bill,

Enclosed is the abstract entitled "Effects of Sendai Virus
and Vaccine on Short-Term Toxicological and Immunological Markers
in Strain A/J Mice," to be submitted for presentation at the
Annual Meeting of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists
in Monterey, California, November 10-13, 1981.

I would like to obtain approval to spend existing CTR travel
funds for no more than $400, which ought to cover supersaver airfare.
If this meets with your approval, would you please initial the copy
of this letter and return it to me for our files.

It was nice to talk to you the other day. I will be in touch
after I return.



Best regards,

Carol

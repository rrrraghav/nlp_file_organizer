Subject: VICEROY Project

Dear Thom:

This summarizes our understanding of future action to be taken by McCann-Erickson on the VICEROY Project. Please let me know, as soon as possible, if this varies from your understanding.

1. Contract: McCann will forward to my attention a copy of our contract revised to note their specific concerns and overall approach to the assignment. This should be in our hands the week of October 4.

2. Research Proposals: McCann will forward to B&W research proposals for Projects A and B and advertising campaign evaluation. These proposals should cover objectives, methodology, timing, suppliers, and costs. Please forward to my attention the week of October 4, a date when these proposals will be forthcoming. B&W will fund this research pending prior approval and will observe various research activities to the degree possible.

3. Strategies: McCann will forward to B&W a recommended marketing strategy and advertising strategy for the VICEROY brand. B&W expects this document prior to approval of any ad production costs. Please supply a date when this will be forthcoming.

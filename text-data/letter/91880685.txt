Re: Lorillard’s 1992 Fourth Quarter
California Lobbying Report

Dear Rich:

Enclosed are the Covington & Burling and Carpenter,
Snodgrass & Associates figures that you will need to prepare
the 1992 fourth quarter California lobbying report for
Lorillard Tobacco Company. Nielsen, Merskamer has indicated
that it will provide you with a memorandum listing Lorillard’s
share of the fees and disbursements paid to that firm by
Covington & Burling.

I have asked Carpenter, Snodgrass & Associates to
provide you with a list of any legislation they have worked on
in Lorillard's behalf during the fourth quarter. Nielsen,
Merskamer will also advise you whether the firm engaged in any
reportable lobbying activity during that same period.

If you need any additional information, please let

me know. Very truly yours,



Joseph K. Doss

Mr. W. Thomas Hoyt, President
The Council for Tobacco Research -
U.S.A., Inc.

Dear Mr. Hoyt:

Dr. Kouri and Dr. Henry have had conversations with Dr. Lisanti
relative to the timetable we were following for the Final Report
and manuscript preparation on Contract 026839. I thought it would be
appropriate for me to drop you this note to let you know the current
status of our progress.

Over the Christmas holidays we ran into some serious computer
hardware problems which resulted in our falling behind schedule by
approximately one week. Then last week Dr. Kouri’s best friend was
killed in an automobile accident, causing us to lose a week of his
input. Thus we are behind our original target by two weeks and,
therefore, I would like to revise the deadline for submission of
the Final Report to January 31st. Since the manuscripts are in
tandem and will be generated from the Final Report Data Base, the
completion date for the two manuscripts would be rescheduled to
March 31st.

I hope this does not inconvenience you significantly, and
appreciate your understanding in the matter. I have seen the work
they are generating and feel certain that you will be quite pleased
and impressed with the Final Report.

Sincerely,

John C. Parker, Ph.D.
President

Hon, Commissioner of Patents

Sir:

In response to the Advisory Action mailed
August 19, 1963, we would like to make the following
remarks:

The interview with the Examiner on October 1,
1963 is respectfully acknowledged. As was pointed out in
the interview, the Examiner’s refusal to enter the
Amendment after final rejection filed July 22, 1963
is believed to be erroneous. Claims 1 to 6 presently
pending recite a tobacco filter wherein a polymeric
compound selected from the group consisting of polymers
and copolymers containing the N-vinyl-5-methyl-2-
oxazolidinone unit and polyethers containing 10% to
52% other oxygen is used to selectively adsorb phenol
and phenolic compound from tobacco smoke. By the afore-
mentioned Amendment dated July 22, 1963, it is proposed
to restrict the application and claims 1 to 6 to the use
only of polymers and copolymers containing the N-vinyl-
5-methyl-2-oxazolidinone unit. Such claims are narrower

Dear Mr. Wantland:

Several weeks ago we discussed the possibility of your school district using the materials produced by the Family C.O.U.R.S.E. Consortium. I sent to you a copy of the booklet, "Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" and a videotape of public service announcements that would send a message to parents that you join in the effort to eliminate youth smoking.

I wonder if you have had a chance to review these materials that we are providing to school districts at no cost. Assuming that your schedule gets no lighter after the first of the year, I have taken the liberty to provide you with a form to facilitate your response. Would you please take a moment to complete the form and mail it to me at the address below or FAX it to 202/393-4385.

I do hope that you will join forces with the Consortium to help parents and other adults communicate with youngsters about a variety of issues like smoking that are influenced in part by peer pressure.

My best wishes for a happy 1992.

Cordially,

Phyllis Blaustain

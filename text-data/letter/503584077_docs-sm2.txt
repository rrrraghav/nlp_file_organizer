RE: BRIGHT WEEKLY ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 20

* Attended a meeting with representatives from the Coupon Redemption Center to finalize coding and tabulation specifications for the BRIGHT screening questionnaire. This questionnaire is designed to identify full-time and part-time users of the brand as well as occasional smokers. Response rates thus far on the mail-out questionnaire have been higher than anticipated. Roughly 10,000 returns have been received during the first week following mailing. In addition to providing smokers for BRIGHT’s Identified 2-Pack/Carton Test, we expect to receive enough names to use in a number of other research projects. A copy of the screening status is attached.

* Issued an analysis of BRIGHT 100's Competitive Product Test. While only two waves of BRIGHT’s Competitive Test are complete, Wave I was boosted to allow for a full sample following the completion of Wave II. Overall ratings indicate that 63% of full menthol acceptors rated BRIGHT 100 70+. Additionally, 54.5% of full flavor menthol acceptors rated the brand 70+. While BRIGHT’s 1983 Competitive Testing does not include a menthol competitor, these results indicate that BRIGHT 100's acceptance among its primary target group (low tar menthol acceptors) is high.

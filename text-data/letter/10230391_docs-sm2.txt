Dear Council For Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc.:

You are the sponsoring agency of a program of research into quest-
ions of tobacco use and health, an outgrowth of the Tobacco Industry
Research Council formed nearly in 1958 by tobacco manufacturers, growers,
and warehousemen. They would have tobacco manufacturers, growers and ware-
housemen want to finance research into tobacco use and health knowing
that such research might discover that cigarettes or other
tobacco products cause disease and kill people; thus working against
their own self-interest in growing, manufacturing, and selling tobacco.
Please answer this perplexing question. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Rome Rechmitz
Roni Rechnitz

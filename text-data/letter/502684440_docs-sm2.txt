Subject: Column Substitution for Cocoa Analysis Date: March 1, 1982

To: Ms. Brenda Hodge From: Ted Conner,
Gary Shelar and
Dave Colby

The Waters Radial-Pak C18, 10µ, 5 mm ID column that is currently being used for the analysis of vanillin, ethyl vanillin, piperonal, and coumarin in smoking tobacco, the analysis of vanillin in filter rods, and the analysis of coumarin in cigarettes can also be used for the analysis of cocoa in tobacco products using the same mobile phase that was used on the Whatman ODS-2 column (60% water, 40% methanol, by volume). The analysis time is reduced to 6 minutes and eliminates the need to switch columns for these methods. The chromatographic conditions are:

Column: RCSS 5 C18 10µ
Flow Rate: 1.0 ml/min.
Mobile Phase: 60% water, 40% methanol, by volume.
Detector: Fixed wavelength, 280 m, x 0.2 AUFS.

Attached is a typical chromatogram.

Dear Susan:

LeBoeuf & Gautier Smoke Eliminator - Airlines

I am sorry about my delay in writing about this filter and in truth have little to say about it.

There are several high efficiency filters available that work on a similar principle, i.e., prefilter, high efficiency particle filter, then charcoal absorbent material. They are indeed efficient and efficiencies of 95% for smoke particles are usual (L&G’s 95% to 99.9% seems unnecessarily ambitious). The odor elimination efficiency of 88% is also higher than most manufacturers claim, but only tests would confirm or disprove this data.

I suspect that the real problem will be an operational life. Airline particle filters apparently are fairly quickly and need to be changed frequently. If one uses a prefilter, it would extend its life considerably and would expect high pressure drops through the filter. This, however, is again subject to proper trials.

I do, however, find it hard to believe that their layer of “charcoal paper” would last long as an odor controller. Banks of charcoal rapidly loose efficiency as absorption of odors and need frequent replacement, and their brief literature describes a "paper film" of charcoal, not a bank of material. I would be surprised if the odor removed efficiency stayed at 80% for 1,000 hours, never mind the 3,000 to 6,000 hour claim.

I would like to think these would work as well as they claim, but I doubt it.

Kindest regards,

Gray Robertson

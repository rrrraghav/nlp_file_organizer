Dear Roger:

Last year, the North Carolina FFA Foundation established a State FFA Officer Scholarship Endowment in honor of Charles L. Keels, who retired after more than 40 years of involvement in agricultural education and FFA.

Thanks to the generous support of more than 240 contributors, each of the 1996-97 State FFA Officers received a $500 college scholarship at the recent State FFA Convention. But, we are only about half-way toward our stated goal of $50,000 for the endowment fund. Your support during 1997 is important to our success in reaching that goal.

Please take a few minutes to complete and return the enclosed response card along with your contribution. Your entire gift is lives of young people!

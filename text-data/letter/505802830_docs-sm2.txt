This is to update you on the plan for conducting unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and SLR/ Drosophila assays extramurally. In conversations with G. Burger and J. Hayes it was confirmed that we would ask SRI and Litton (Hazelton) to conduct the in-vitro UDS assay using two samples of cigarette condensate. One sample would be from a Kentucky reference cigarette (IR4F) and the second comparative sample would be from a RAN product. The cost associated with this assay for two (2) samples at SRI would be $11,000 and at Litton would be $10,400, for a total of $21,400. Johnnie Hayes has contacted Dr. Valencia at Wisconsin and she is forwarding a price list to us for the Drosophila assay. Litton charges $23,500 for a routine Drosophila assay. I suggest that we meet with Gary, Johnnie, Chin, and Bob Suber to decide on a strategy for submitting samples for the Drosophila assay. I estimate that it would cost approximately $100,000 to run two (2) samples through the Drosophila assay at two labs. This is based upon Litton’s price list. This appears to be prohibitive and should be limited to the minimum number of samples.

Johnnie Hayes is initiating conversations with Litton and I have requested a proposal from SRI to conduct the in-vitro UDS assay. Each lab will also be asked to provide us with a schedule for initiation of assays and delivery of draft final reports. I expect that we can have contacts in place and can send samples no later than October 21, 1985.

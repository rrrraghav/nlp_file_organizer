Dear Dr. Di Marco:

I have enclosed a copy of our proposal to test immune milk for potential immunologic factors or modulators for your review.

I have reviewed the cost estimates and would like to request a maximum sum of $11,000 to do the Phase I study. This is a $1,000 higher than originally discussed with Mr. Wayne Juchatz. These funds will cover the costs of all the tests, fees to Dr. E. K. Reese, who will perform the lymphocyte and interleukin 2 assays, and to Dr. Louis Kucera, who will be responsible for the virus and interferon tests, clerical and library costs and my consultation fee based on the agreement prepared and executed by Mr. Juchatz. We will bill on a monthly basis for the expenses incurred.

It is also my understanding that I will interpret the results of the tests, review selected papers related to this topic and prepare a summary report and recommendations as to future work and directions.

I look forward to working with your group. I have enclosed my curriculum vitae for your information.

Sincerely,

Quentin N. Myrick, D.D.
Professor

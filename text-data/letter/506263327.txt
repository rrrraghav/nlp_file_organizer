Dear Jim,

this is to confirm our call earlier. Please supply me with the formulations for:

F-274
Paper flavour # 28
and
the supplier and code of 0-310.

As agreed, would you please ensure that questionnaires (examples available from Brian Lawrence) are sent for each commercial flavourant directly by you to the suppliers. Please include any commercial flavourants contained in F-274, # 28 and 0-310. The suppliers should be asked to have the questionnaires completed via their German offices and sent to me.

Would you also tell me the amount of levulinic acid used on the various components and confirm that the CAG is based on a water extract of tobacco without additives.

Would you please send all future documentation via the secure Fanifax line (No.: 0221/1646 205). I would also appreciate it if you passed this number on to other members of your division who would need it.

Thanks and regards,

)onal
Donald Gillespie

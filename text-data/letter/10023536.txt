Dear Mr. Little:

The Commission has initiated a Trade Regulation Rule
proceeding relating to the advertising of cigarettes. The
proposed rule would require the clear and prominent dis-
closure in cigarette advertising that cigarette smoking is
dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer, coronary
heart disease, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and
other diseases.

Full details concerning these proceedings are contained
in the News Release and Notice of Rulemaking Proceeding
transmitted herewith.

Your participation in these proceedings either by
written submission filed with the undersigned by no late-
r than June 20, 1983 or by oral appearance at public
hearings to commence on July 1, 1983 (with written copies or
summaries of your oral statement to be filed with the
Secretary by no later than June 20, 1983) is cordially invited.
In the event you wish to testify at the hearings, please
advise us of the time you estimate will be necessary to deliver
your statement. In addition, in delivering your oral statement
you may wish to summarize or refer to the information
rather than restating your entire statement, which will have
been made a part of the public record.

Should you or any member of your staff require any
further information, I will be happy to make myself available.

It is regretted that a form letter has been used. The
need for timely notice left no alternative.

Very truly yours,



Edward T. McDonough,
Acting Chief, Division of
Trade Regulation Rules.

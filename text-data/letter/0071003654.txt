Dear Mr. Chester:

This will confirm our conversation of this morning in which I advised you
that the two new permanent paint units in New York which were previously
approved for a May 15, 1975 start are available now. One of the permanents
is located on the Major Deegan Expressway at Willis Avenue w/o The Triboro
Bridge. The other unit is on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Brooklyn.

We recommend taking advantage of the availability of both units by starting
as soon as possible with the Pall/Mall Gold design. If we were to receive
artwork and mechanical stats by next Tuesday (1/21), we estimate that both
paints can be completed by February 15, 1975 barring unforeseen weather
complications.

The additional space costs per month for the February 15, 1975 start are
as follows:

DEEGAN   B.Q.E.    TOTAL
Feb. 15*  $1,662.50 $1,312.50  $2,975.00
March      3,325.00     2,625.00   5,950.00
April      3,325.00     2,625.00   5,950.00
$8,312.50  $6,562.50  $14,875.00

*Space costs estimated to pro-rate for February, 1975.

Please note that the above costs are space costs only and do not reflect
fabrication charges. We will be able to estimate the fabrication costs once
we receive the artwork.

Please advise if you wish us to proceed with painting. Thank you.

Cordially,

Joan Freeberg

Folks -

Since I am out Friday - a "Mr. Mom" weekend looms - I am asking Glenda to follow-up with each of you to get your contributions you have for our weekly report. Generally, brief bullets on significant developments from the past week. David will edit down if necessary.

(John, if you could write intelligent bullets on these two items, in addition to whatever else you can think of: 1. make sure Tom knows we’re committed to doing the letter desk at the N. R. A. on minimum wage; and, 2. that we're assisting with the possible revision to the California smoking ban with some leaders of their restaurant association, in coordination with RJR Gov. Rel.)

Carolyn, is there anything (we’ve already reported on the number of orders we’ve received) from the coalition update we should report? Maybe let them know we reviewed fulfillment procedures and are doing a separate communication to our sales force???
What else?

Whatever else any of you can think of.

Thanks.

- Rob

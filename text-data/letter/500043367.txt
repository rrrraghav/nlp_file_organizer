Subject: SALEM CONCERT SERIES -- 1983 CONTRACT

Both copies of the attached contract require your signature.

This contract is unchanged from our 1982 contract with three exceptions:

• Revised talent, dates and locations for 1983 (our talent is Alabama, Juice Newton, and The Thrasher Brothers).

• We have been requested by the Law Department to specify that the supplier of our talent search program submit bills through Century II (Paragraph 4.01).

• The term of this contract is 15 months since talent negotiations began in October (Paragraph 6).

This contract has been reviewed by the Law Department, Financial Services, as well as Special Events Operations, and they are in agreement.

If there are any questions, please advise. Please return the signed contracts to Bert Cudd.

SUBJECT: LNA Consumer Tests DATE: April 21, 1989

TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: J. P. Dickerson

I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project IMA-10P, scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailbox. The IMA-10V product, which is being mailed for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining consumer taste data on a “no nicotine” prototype. The IMA-10V product has a blend nicotine of 0.11% and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette. Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05-0.06% in Free and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.09 mg/cigarette as compared to 0.06 in Free and Next.

The low nicotine in LNA-10V was obtained through conventional denicotization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the IMA-10P product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In theory, the IMA-10P approach will give approximately the same nicotine value as the LNA-10V approach, using tobacco blends in inventory.

If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing the water extraction process with conventional denicotization. Comparison of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water extraction is being changed significantly.

Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to producing material for one consumer test.

I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we should delay any consumer tests related to LNA-10P until we have done a more thorough job of process and formulation development.

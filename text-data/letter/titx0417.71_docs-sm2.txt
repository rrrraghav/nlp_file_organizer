Dear Mr. Chairman:

Thank you for your letter of March 11, suggesting that the Public Health Service undertake an evaluation of research done on the effects of the vapor phase of cigarette smoke on human health.

The Surgeon General is in accord with your feeling that such an evaluation would be useful at this time. Accordingly, he has asked me and others involved with the problem to proceed. I will keep you informed of our progress.

The Public Health Service continues to be encouraged and heartened by your interest in the smoking and health problem and your support of efforts to reduce the burden of this health hazard on millions of Americans.

Sincerely yours,

Daniel Horn

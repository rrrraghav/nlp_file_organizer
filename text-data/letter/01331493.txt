Health-Related Costs of Cigarette Smoking To Be Assessed: The price tag of
anti-smoking policies will be calculated in a two-year study now underway with
support from the National Center for Health Services Research (NCHSR). The
project is one of the first to assess the economic and social impacts of
anti-smoking initiatives, such as the ban of cigarette advertising from radio
and television and the passage of "clean air" laws restricting smoking in
public places. Besides assessing the costs of these initiatives, the study
will estimate the health and environmental costs of smoking, including ill-
nesses, fires, automobile accidents, and productivity losses. The research
also will determine the impact of anti-smoking policies on the agricultural
economy as well as calculate how the costs of smoking are distributed among
the States and various groups, such as the young, the elderly, smokers, and
non-smokers. Results are expected to have important implications for health
policy-making and for future public policy research. The study will be carried
out under an NCHSR grant by researchers at the University of Michigan headed
by Kenneth E. Warner, Ph.D.

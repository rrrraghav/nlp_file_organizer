Dear Mr. Ramm,

I am a third year student at the University of Michigan
Law School and I am researching the problem of whether the
Federal Trade Commission has the authority to promulgate Trade
Regulation Rules. I would appreciate it very much if you
would send me a copy of the memorandum which you submitted
to the FTC on this matter. My specific concern is whether
the Commission has the power in connection with cigarette
labeling and advertising.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,

Edward Levy

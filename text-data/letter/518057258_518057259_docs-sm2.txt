Re: 7-Eleven - New Display Sign-Up Request

Ladies & Gentlemen:

Attached, please find a copy of the new RJR request for 7-Eleven display and a copy
of the current contract screen. These supervisors are requesting that we get into each
attached account and set up the 7-11 BASE PLAN.

The following procedure should be followed:

1) Contact requesting store to ensure understanding of our 7-11 Base
Wrap program and requirements.

2) If accepted, set up “ANYTHING” - temporaries, components, etc. to allow
the store to participate immediately with our multi-pack promotion and
display allowance.

3) Order the 7-11 Wrap Display by voice mailing Jack Ivey @ VM# 78315.
(They may take some time to arrive as corp has a backorder situation right
now).

4) Check for the RJR/7-11 Clock - if not present, VM Jack Ivey again with a
clock request.

5) Update SIS appropriately:

Type Plan Unit
1 BASE 2 7/11 1
PK ACCRUAL LZC 1

(The 1 Base 2 pays the display allowance, the Pk Accrual goes to 7-Eleven Corp to fund
the multipack promotion and will be redistributed based on store sales).

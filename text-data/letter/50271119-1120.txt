Dear Dr. Sommers:

I am writing this letter to inquire about submitting a research proposal concerning studies on blood pressure lowering effect of heparin and other anticoagulants to Tobacco Research Council. The preliminary observations indicate that heparin has a potent anti-hypertensive effect (Mandl et al.,
Microsvas Res 16:373, 1978; Susic et al., hypertension, submitted). This proposal will include studies that are designed to investigate the mechanisms of the hypotensive effect of heparin. It is expected that the proposed study may contribute significantly in the therapeutic approaches to the hypertensive patients.

This investigation will be conducted at the Institute for Medical Research,
Beograd, Yugoslavia, and at the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City. Drs. Susic and Kenter are at Beograd, Yugoslavia are established investigators in the field of hypertension and they have the skills and facilities for in-depth investigations in the designed area. They will initiate various hemodynamic studies and measurements of humoral factors that might be involved in the hypotensive effects of heparin. The renal histopathology studies (light & electron microscopy) will be done at Oklahoma City. However, immunofluorescence microscopy study will be done at Beograd. Dr. Susic and myself are very interested to extend our protocol in studying the effects of nicotine or other compounds from tobacco such as cadmium in the pathophysiology of hypertension and whether or not heparin or other anticoagulants may modify the effects of tobacco compounds.

According to your advice I am enclosing an approximate budget each year for a period of three years.

Dear Tom -

Re MDA NO/NOx Field Kit

MDA requires prepayment before shipment
of materials to private individuals, accordingly
I mailed check for $ 2500.00 for kit yesterday.
Copies for verification are enclosed. I presume
this will suffice to reimburse me.
As soon as MDA receives check, presumably
July 20, kit will be shipped to me by UPS and
I will immediately transfer by OPS to
you.

Congrats on the birth of your son. Best wishes
to Mrs Oodone and you. $000018736

Sincerely
humma

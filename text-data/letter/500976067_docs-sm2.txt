Re: Maxwell Report (Page 5 Attached)

1. The attached document may seem rather long; however, it is essential in this form to follow-through with the rational involved.

2. Claude Teague’s summary on the first page and a half explains that apparently:

(a) A gap exists in brands on the market because no cigarette has both an acceptable level of nicotine and a “tar”-to-nicotine ratio: (T/N Ratio) of less than 13. (T/N Ratio: divide FTC "tar" by FTC nicotine.)

(b) Perhaps we should go for developing a cigarette delivering 1.3 mg. of nicotine and 13 mg. of “tar.”

(c) This would provide a product with a “desirable” T/N Ratio of 10.

3. Kool is the only brand that falls close to a 13.1% T/N Ratio; however, even this is substantially over the 10 that appears to be what we should be shooting for if the Maxwell Report is a reliable reference. Carlton’s ratio gives a T/N Ratio of 10 (“tar” 4 mg., nicotine 0.4 mg.); however, at near our specified nicotine delivery value of 1.3 mg., there is no brand with a T/N Ratio of less than 13.

4. At our specified nicotine level of 1.3 mg. the smoker must receive at least 17 mg. of “tar” as applied to any current brand. No other option is available -- which appears to be a gap and an unmet need, or marketing opportunity. Research believes it can come up with a product to fill this gap with consumer acceptance.

5. Perhaps Consumer Research should look at this more closely.

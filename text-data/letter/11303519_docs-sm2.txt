Dear Jim

Some positions in life seem intractable. Tinged with sadness I hereby
tender my resignation from the SAB of CTR.

You had correctly interpreted my level of discontent and I would concur
with you that CTR was becoming an ever-increasing demand on my time
and personal resources.

I wish you all well and I shall retain some fond memories which for me
more than compensate for the current bad taste left in both our mouths.

With regards.

Yours sincerely



Jeffrey R Idle

BRANDS RED TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM

A several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening in nature, and concentrated of blend and casings variables.

CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM

o FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models

Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute ratings on NFO testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for the following smoker groups testing RJR products:

o FF competitive smokers
o FF franchise smokers
o FFLT competitive smokers
o FFLT franchise smokers

The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.

o FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models

Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200 additional cases for the development of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototype tests submitted to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.

o Consumer Test Data Base

Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on 292 CT tests has been catalogued.

o Review of Competitive Brand Test Results

Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into effect as of September, 1984.

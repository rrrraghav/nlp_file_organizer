The Honorable Arne H. Carlian
Governor, State Capital
St. Paul, Minnesota

Dear Governor Carlian:

I am writing you in regard to H.P. No. 117 which has recently come to my attention and about which I am terribly concerned, specifically Section 3, “Manufacturers to Report Certain Substances to Abolish in Indiscriminat Local Ordinances.”

While I could go into the details, I think it is sufficient to say that this is an onerous, unworkable and impossible set of requirements to demand and/or obtain. In effect, it probably would be easier to merely pass a law forbidding the sale of cigars within the state of Minnesota as this would have exactly the same effect.

While it is certainly politically incorrect to be in our business at the moment, the reality is that political tides do shift, and once cannot discount the reality of the economic benefits that are brought to the State both through tobacco taxes and related employment.

This is a real economic factor as opposed to hyperbole created by statisticians of negative words to the State all of which has yet to be proven in the courts. The fact that this legislation was not part of the proposed legislation would make one believe that it has been added at the last minute by individuals with very personal motives and agendas, ones not necessarily designed with the best interests of the State in mind.

As a Company who pays taxes to your State, we are virtually concerned with this legislation and we urge you to veto H.P. #117.

Cordially,



Joel J. Sherman
President

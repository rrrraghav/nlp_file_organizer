Gentlemen:

I have noticed your new advertising as per the attached copy and I’m curious as to what type of special treatment you are giving this product.  It seems a rather mild taste. I have been a Belieish smoker for many years but I have noted that it is not quite as strong as your cigarettes. Of course, there's also the possibility that this new type has been diluted and no longer reaches into the Metropolitan New York area.

A prompt reply would be most appreciated, as right now I think my taste buds are play-ing games with me.



Very truly yours

Dear Mr. Gertenbach:

Thank-you for awarding a grant of $75,000/year for our research concerning the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced cognitive facilitation. Hopefully, this research will lead to a better understanding of the neural bases of cognitive function as well as new leads for treatments for cognitive impairment such as is seen in Alzheimer’s disease. Enclosed is a revised budget and the other forms you needed returned. We will let you know about the progress of our research as it proceeds. Thank-you again for your support.

Sincerely,

Ed Lemi

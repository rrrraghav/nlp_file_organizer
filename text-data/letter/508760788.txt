SUBJECT: Winston Select Audio Tape Promotion

Dear Mike:

As discussed, our strategy for the Winston Select audio tape promotion is to clear as many popular country acts as the budget will allow and include a like number of up-and-coming artists.

As you know, we have only had four (4) days to work on developing the A&R, therefore the attached preliminary list is not as extensive or qualified as it could be. Please note this list represents a combination of the popular country artists and up-and-coming acts we believe fit the demographics of the 18-25 target audience. The artist’s current availability is noted per the description on the bottom of the preliminary A&R, of course given more time we will be able to clarify the availability of those not yet confirmed.

As far as costs, I have worked backwards from the $0.70 budget you provided.
We can do the following:

3MM Univ./Norolex Box & 4-Color J-Card
4-8 Songs $0.70

The number of songs will be dependent upon the number of up-and-coming artists that we will be able to obtain at no cost other than the trade-off for exposure to the million Winston Select customers. The pricing does include a minimum of 4 popular artists.

Please give me a call at 619-944-8933 so we can discuss this in further detail.

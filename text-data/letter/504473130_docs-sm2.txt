3. Reducing Casing for G-13-14

Completed HBD (W/A/B/C) tests indicated that franchise smokers could not
discriminate either formula: (1) with 50% of the G-13 casing removed from
the control or (2) with 50% of casing transferred from G-13-14 to Part II.
Seven major brands were tested. Cost estimates have been requested to be com-
pleted by July 25.

An AR proposing the 50% casing reduction on all G-13-14 has been put on
hold pending a review of all G-13 projects.

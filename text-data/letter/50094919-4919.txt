Dear Mr. Hoyt:

Your letter of October 29, 1973 is acknowledged, and I may say a bit tearfully under the circumstances. After receiving your letter I talked to Bob Hockett on the phone and mentioned that we would continue to be sending reports on progress and new findings – with some new material already in the mail.

At this time I write to ask if permission can be granted for us to expend any unused funds past April 1, 1974, the cut-off date mentioned in your letter. Such permission, if granted, would probably enable us to get better accomplishments and give a better return for each and every dollar.

In other words, although I know that as a result of the cut-off and the general time schedule of other agencies we are going to be at the brink of financial disaster for salary money at the time when most people tend to change jobs, there is some possibility that part of the present staff might leave before April 1, 1974 and others might have trouble finding a satisfactory location by the cut-off date of April 1, 1974. Hence the request for discretionary use of funds past April 1 is made.

Any consideration will be appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Approved

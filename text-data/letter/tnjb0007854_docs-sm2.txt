State Representative

Dear Doug:

Thank you for your thoughtful letter expressing opposition
to the Clinton Administration’s decision to grant the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) increased authority to regulate
tobacco. It was good to hear from you.

I appreciate your keeping me informed about Ohio House Bill
499, your legislation that is designed to strengthen tobacco
laws. I agree with you that strict enforcement of state minimum
age laws is key to keeping young people from using tobacco
products. I applaud your efforts and will keep your thoughts
about FDA very much in mind should legislation on this issue
reach the House floor.

Thank you for taking the time to write. Stay in touch.

Sincerely,

RP/jo

Rob Portman

RE: WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS

DATE: JANUARY 15, 1991

MENTHOL DEVELOPMENT (MARUMERIZED)
--------------------------
STATUS: A MENTHOL PROTOTYPE USING APCC AS A REPLACEMENT FOR ALUMINA RECEIVED GOOD REVIEWS FROM INFORMAL TASTE PANELS AND PERFORMED BETTER ON ANALYTICS THAN THE CONTROL. THE APCC MARUMERIZED MENTHOL SUBSTRATE WAS MADE BY ADDING THE MENTHOL DIRECTLY TO THE MIX VIA AN ALCOHOL DILUTION THIS MAKING THE PROCESS MORE SIMPLE. A HEAT SOURCE HAVING K-24 AND TURKISH TOBACCO COMPLIMENTED THE OVERALL TASTE. SIGNIFICANCE: AN IMPROVED MENTHOL PRODUCT WITHOUT ALUMINA IS FEASIBLE. NEXT STEP: FURTHER INVESTIGATE CARBON AS A ALUMINA REPLACEMENT IN MARUMERIZED MENTHOL SUBSTRATE.

MENTHOL DEVELOPMENT (PAPER SUBSTRATE)
--------------------------
STATUS: TOBACCO EXTRACTS THAT WILL GIVE NICOTINE IMPACT AND TOBACCO TASTE IS BEING EVALUATED FOR USE IN A MENTHOL PRODUCT THAT USES THE BAC PLUG AS THE MENTHOL DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO FAR 10 EXTRACTS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED SEPARATELY, AND WORK TO COMBINE THEM IS UNDER WAY. SIGNIFICANCE: MENTHOL YIELD WITH THE BAC PLUG IS SUFFICIENT WITH THE PAPER SUBSTRATE, BUT THE TOBACCO TASTE AND IMPACT MUST BE OPTIMIZED TO HAVE A PROPER MENTHOL/TOBACCO TASTE BALANCE. NEXT STEP: COMBINED TOBACCO EXTRACTER PAPER SUBSTRATE MODELS BEING MADE FOR EVALUATION. TIMING: EVALUATION COMPLETE 1/31/91

ENZYME TREATED TOBACCO EXTRACT
--------------------------
STATUS: MOST OF THE NONE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. NO INCREASED AMEs IN THE AEROSOL AND NON IN THEINK UP WAS GOOD NEWS. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ENZYME IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE TREATMENT PROCESS AGAINST WHETHER PROBLEMS FOUND IN AEROSOLS ARE TO BE DETERMINED. A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT WHEN SIGNED, WILL ALLOW US TO TALK TO NOVO COMPANY TO SOLICIT THEIR HELP IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION. A MEETING IS SET FOR JANUARY 29 WITH NOVO, TOO, BOARDS NTP PERSONNEL TO COORDINATE THE WORK. NEXT STEP: MEETING. TIMING: JAN 28/1991.

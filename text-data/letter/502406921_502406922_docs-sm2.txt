Mr. S. Clay Williams, President
c/o R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
Winston-Salem, North Carolina

Dear Mr. Williams:

"Political Conventions and Elections" and the Humidor
Pouch, even though you did not react favorably to them is no
reason why I may not yet work out a plan agreeable to you.


Without going into detail, I want to say that part of
the idea I have is an entirely new copy slant for Camel
Cigarettes. A copy note every bit as powerful as the Humidor
Pack and "I'd walk a mile for a Camel".

If that is so, and I assure you it is, undoubtedly you
will be interested in knowing what it is.

It will enable Camel to again capitalize the times
with a new sparkling, dazzling and dramatic copy angle -
one that fits Camel" like a glove.

The idea, of which the copy note is part, can be
adopted to your present radio presentation, without dis-
turbing it, in such a manner as to hold the Camel Radio
audience for a full hour after you have left the air. It
provides a hook on which to hang your program.

I have gone to considerable trouble and expense to
lay the idea out so that it can be quickly visualized, and
I believe, instantly appreciated, for what it is - a valuable
and important advertising idea.

Therefore, I am going to ask if you won't be kind
enough to advise me by Wire, if you will give the time to
look the presentation over, if I mail it to you for your
quick reaction.



Don’t risk this, Mr. Williams, believe me, it is one

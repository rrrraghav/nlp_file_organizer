RE: Rail Rack Status

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

Attached is a letter sent by Stan Carter to the GM Sales Managers. The letter contains information about the status of the rail racks. The last part of the letter is a breakdown by store of when the rail racks were sent. The list also includes the quantity sent to each location.

Many of you have been asking if these fixtures have any value. Reading this letter you can clearly see that Albertson’s does. They are very happy with what these fixtures are doing in their stores. They attribute a fair portion of their sales increase to this program. Please continue to support this fixture program as much as possible.

Thank you again for all your help and cooperation. If you should have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to call me.

Respectfully,
J. Chase Hymas

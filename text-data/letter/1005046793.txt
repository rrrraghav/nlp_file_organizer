Re: CN #981-80 (Carlton Cigarettes)

Dear Mr. Goldsmith:

Enclosed are copies of letters from James Bondelid of Seattle, Washington and Robert Jacobson of Lakewood, Colorado. Although we do not represent Mr. Bondelid or Mr. Jacobson (or other private parties), we carefully note and monitor all reports of practices which may be unlawful under the statutes we enforce. Some of these reports result in investigation or other formal action by the Commission, if warranted.

In forwarding this information for your attention and consideration we have not passed upon its merits nor upon any questions of law which may be involved. Mr. Bondelid and Mr. Jacobson have indicated however, that the enclosed advertisements for three different brands of cigarettes are misleading in that all claim to be the lowest in tar, although the Carlton brand appears to have less tar. Accordingly, please provide information sufficient to substantiate your claim or explain the discrepancy in the statistics used in these advertisements. In addition, we would appreciate any other comments, including any action taken or proposed by your company, concerning this matter.

The Commission specifically reserves the right to take any action deemed appropriate under the law.

Sincerely,

Terrence C. Brown
Terrance C. Brown
Attorney

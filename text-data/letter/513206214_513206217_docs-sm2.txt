Dear Fellow Employee:

In order that you might have a better understanding of the many
operations carried on within the Company, we have outlined in previous
letters the work performed by seven different Departments. Today we
want to tell you about another important teammate, the Advertising
Department.

This Department is under the management of Mr. W. T. Smither, a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company. His Assistant is
Mr. Ernest M. Pulp. The 20 employees in the Department are directly
supervised by Mr. W. H. Maddey, Office Manager, and Mr. Gray N.
Leinbach, Assistant Office Manager.

The operations of the Advertising Department lie along two general
lines. First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every
phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it
follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and
making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget
authorized.

Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping
instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the
Company’s Sales Representatives in the field.

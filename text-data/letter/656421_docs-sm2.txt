January 4, 1977

Ms. Pam Stall
P - K - G

Dear Pam:

Please suspend all work on the VICEROY Lights media plan for 1977
pending future decisions from the Brand Group. A strategic re-
evaluation of VICEROY KS has complicated the positioning of VICEROY
Lights as well as the timing of the possible introduction of this line
extension. Please call with any questions you may have.

Sincerely,

E. A. Willets, III

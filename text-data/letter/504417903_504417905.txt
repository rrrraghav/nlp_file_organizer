Re: FOCUS GROUPS FOR PROJECT “I”

Attached to this memo is the report on the focus groups for Project "I." My interpretation of the groups and the thoughts given in the report are in agreement. The groups were conducted in Cincinnati on April 12 and 13.

Background

The focus groups were conducted to gain a qualitative reaction to cigarette ideas directed at social problems connected with smoking. The bulk of the discussion centered on four ideas:

1. A cigarette with no sidestream smoke.
2. A cigarette with 50% less sidestream smoke.
3. A cigarette with a pleasant aroma.
4. A cigarette which did not stain teeth or fingers.

Summary of Results

1. Smokers will not accept any modification in their cigarette which would adversely affect its taste. There seems to be a predisposition that any changes in a cigarette tend to adversely affect the taste - perhaps a result of experience with low tar cigarettes.

2. Smokers do feel that sidestream (or “raw”) smoke can be bothersome to both non-smokers and smokers due to the odor and irritation. However, they did indicate that the smoke does have some psychological benefits (the aroma, the visual pleasure of watching the smoke, a feeling of comfort). Smokers were very skeptical that a cigarette like this could deliver much taste.

3. A cigarette which gave off 50% (or noticeably) less smoke seemed to be a reasonable compromise to many of the panel members. The psychological benefits are retained, but there is less smoke to collect in a house, gather on clothes, etc. However, most members agreed that non-smokers would remain dissatisfied as long as a cigarette gave off any smoke.

Dear Howard:

I am enclosing a disclosure written by Dr. Inkeep on his work in "Attaching Activated Carbon Particles to Long-Par Filter Medium."

As you know, we would like to cover anything that we can in the carbon filter area even though the coverage may be narrow. I would like to discuss with you the patentability of the information in this disclosure.



Sincerely,

Mrs. Thelma C. Heatwole
Patent Liaison Officer

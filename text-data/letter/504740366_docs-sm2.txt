Re: Topics on Smoking Issues for West Palm Beach Trip

Moderation

• Provide greater satisfaction in fewer cigarettes per pack so
that smokers can cut down their daily consumption.

• Increase tar and nicotine in first puffs of cigarette with
the decreasing strength so smoker effectively moderates
intake while receiving satisfying smoke at first.

Social Acceptability

• Reduce the irritation of smoke to non-smokers by adding
aromatics as is done in pipe tobaccos.

• Provide a foreign cigarette positioned to college educated,
affluent, 30-40 year old smokers that will have greater
perceived quality, higher price and possibly be aromatic.

• Deliver nicotine through filter with reduced tar level in
smoke to provide smoker satisfaction while reducing perceived
irritation to non-smokers.

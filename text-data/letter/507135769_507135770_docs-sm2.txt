RE: Event Sponsorship – "Johnny Canales Show" - Concert

BACKGROUND

On Sunday, October 22, 1989 the taping of the Johnny Canales show will be open to the public in Corpus Christi. Johnny Canales is the Tejano version of Johnny Carson who has a live entertainment show over all Univision stations featuring Tejano artists. His show has a massive grass roots appeal and his audience is difinately our target market.

The proceeds from those attending will go to benefit the local Boys and Girls Clubs. Estimated attendance is 10,000. Although the show will be taped for a later airing, there is no problem with our participation. We did the same type of event here in Houston in June to benefit the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and it was very successful.

RECOMMENDATION

I am recommending participation in this event.

RATIONALE

Participation in this event will provide the Camel Brand with extensive exposure in Corpus Christi’s Hispanic market in a relatively slow promotional period. In addition, participation in this event will provide the brand with an opportunity to:

* Sample our target market
* Distribute our premiums
* Display our banners and inflatables
* Set up our Camel Video Van – show our videos
* Include our logo in print publicity

This will also provide us with a good event for this market which has not been to active in promotional events.

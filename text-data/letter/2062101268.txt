RE: Trademark VIRGINIA SLIMS and Infringement by VIRGINIA
SLAMS Candy Cigarettes

Dear Mr. Cohen:

The existence of your VIRGINIA SLAMS candy cigarettes on the market in the United States has been noted. This is a clear infringement of our VIRGINIA SLIMS and VIRGINIA SLIMS package design trademarks and must immediately cease.

As you are no doubt aware, VIRGINIA SLIMS and the VIRGINIA SLIMS package design are the registered trademarks of Philip Morris. VIRGINIA SLIMS are one of the largest selling cigarettes in the United States, and considerable goodwill has been built up by virtue of the use of VIRGINIA SLIMS and the VIRGINIA SLIMS package design. VIRGINIA SLAMS, and the package design of the candy cigarettes are confusingly similar with our mentioned trademarks and trade dress. Your use of these confusingly similar trademarks and trade dress on candy cigarettes is likely to cause confusion and the mistaken idea that Philip Morris has authorized, licensed the use of its trademarks and trade dress for your company’s product, or is in some way connected therewith. This is particularly unfortunate, because smoking is an adult decision and your products are primarily intended for children.

In the circumstances, you should immediately discontinue the use of VIRGINIA SLAMS or any other word or words which are confusingly similar with VIRGINIA SLIMS and also discontinue

Dear Jane:

Attached please find two copies of the 1988 Agency Compensation Agreement as outlined in my memo of March 30, 1988. Please return one copy to us after you have signed it.

We have very much enjoyed working with the Agency over the past twelve months during which we have had to deal with many difficult issues. This coming year will be a landmark for both Y&R and Reynolds with the successful introduction of SPA.

We look forward to an exciting and challenging year ahead.

Best regards,

G. W. McKenna

SUBJECT: R. J. REYNOLDS / PHILIP MORRIS NEGOTIATIONS

Dear Stan,

After receiving the latest schematic for the twenty-four foot (24’) lobby set from Philip Morris (PM), I felt compelled to review the different scenarios we have negotiated through attempting to satiate PM. Candidly, I am beginning to question whether your PM contact for the negotiations has the authority to make corporate decisions. Clearly, we have negotiated through points, reached agreement with PM, only to have them change their minds on critical points previously decided. I am frustrated by this, as I know you are.

The original document initiating the negotiations, as well as five (5) scenarios, which we have negotiated in good faith, are attached. From our last conversation, it was my understanding that you submitted Scenarios 2, 3, and 5 back to PM for their approval of one. PM responded with a schematic back to Albertson’s, which in my opinion, does not warrant a response.

Below are the various negotiation steps involving the lobby set, as well as a summary of points agreed upon prior to moving to the next step.

Original Scenario:

Twenty-four feet (24’) of merchandisers featuring the following:

* Four foot (4’) Saving Section with one foot (1’) each for Doral and Basic and two feet (2’) for Best Value.

* Six (6’) for package cigarettes, two (2) three feet (3’) merchandisers, one (1) for PM and one (1) for R. J. Reynolds (RJR).

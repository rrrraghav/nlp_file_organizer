We received today a draft of the trans-ANETHOLE Monograph for JECFA purposes from Dr. Ian Munro/Ms. Elike Kemepohl (CanTox, Inc.).

Each member of the FEMA-FEXPAN plus John Hallagan and Tim Adams have received their copies from CanTox Inc. The FEMA-FEXPAN will conduct its review of the draft Monograph to: (A) Examine the approach employed for the preparation; (B) Coordinate the interaction of this draft Monograph to related work (interpretive summaries) and associated effort within the structurally related chemical class (group); and (C) To prepare pro- and con- criticism and commentary for CanTox’s re-drafting, leading to the final copy for submission to JECFA.

Related tut coordinated work for the FAO specifications and analytical methodology for submission to FAO must also be accomplished within the same time reference as for JECFA.

In order to meet the submission schedule for JECFA, currently targeted for December 1, 1997, Dr. Ian Munro and his Monograph preparation staff urge that he receive all commentary by September 30th so these comments are in CanTox’s possession on October 1, 1997.

For all commentary, please address these remarks in writing for letter or facsimile transmission to:

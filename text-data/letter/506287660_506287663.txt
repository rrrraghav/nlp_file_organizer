INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE
PANAFX No. 61/4

TO: Jeremy Harris
Canada November 20, 1987

SUBJECT: U.S. Product Classification

This is to advise how the U.S. is hoping to handle the weight/ classification issue regarding SPA.

Under U.S. law, products weighing over 3 pounds per thousand cigarettes (taken at random from a representative sample) are subject to Class B status and a federal excise tax rate more than double Class A cigarettes.

While we do not yet have the final SPA product, current favored prototypes are running in the area of 3 to 3.1 pounds per thousand -- clearly over the weight limitations for Class A designation and tax rates.

One strategy that is being pursued is weight reduction; however, whether this can be achieved while also attaining the best flavor delivery that system is capable of giving is doubtful. And so, we are currently pursuing obtaining a special ruling from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to redefine for this product alone the upper limits of the weight classification.

Our argument is that the A and B classifications were historically determined to tax the amount of tobacco used in a product and, since we have less tobacco than conventional cigarettes, we should be subject to the same treatment as conventional cigarettes. Whether we will be successful remains to be seen.

Current plans are to apply for this exemption in mid-December with expectations of a response at earliest a month later. This may in part determine when and how we initiate similar proceedings (if possible and if appropriate) with the Canadian government and it would impact your timing for this aspect of government approvals required.

If you have any further questions, kindly advise and I’ll be happy to obtain answers to them.

Best regards.

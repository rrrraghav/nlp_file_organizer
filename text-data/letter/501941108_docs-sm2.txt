My dear Ed:

I am enclosing a memorandum covering the points
discussed with Paul and Parker at today’s meeting. They both
agreed that we should go ahead with the program as outlined,
and I hope that the proposed course of action meets with your
approval. I am sorry that you could not be with us.

With kind personal regards.

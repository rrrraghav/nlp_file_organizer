Docket No. H-122, Room N-2625
U.S. Department of Labor
200 Constitution Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20210

Dear Sirs:

Of the employees of this company 95% of them are
smokers, myself included. As I’m led to understand the
ruling of Docket #H-122 will affect all areas of my operation.
Namely that the cab of our semi-tractors are considered
the workplace, which would require that my drivers don't
smoke while they drive. With all the federal regulations which
already affect our industry this one is the most outrageous,
it borders on the invasion of our driver home when they are
on the road. If we make them stop for a smoke break it would
cost us an additional 2 hour a day. I find this highly
intolerable.

Secondly I’m led to understand that I will have to be
designated smoke free enviorment in a truck repair shop.
This additional cost to our company to create a negative
pressure enviorment room will be a extra cost which will
affect our financial situation.

The creation of more regulations onto small business
is becoming highly intolerable, new D.O.T. regulations,
workers compensation increases, and changes in Federal
and state regulations. Those actions cannot be tolerated by
small business

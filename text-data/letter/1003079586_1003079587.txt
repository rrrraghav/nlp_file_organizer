Gentlemen:

I feel it incumbent upon me to express my appreciation and profound gratitude to the Philip Morris Co. for a very good product - the Philip Morris cigarettes. For a few years I developed a cough. I do not know what the cough was due to smoking Luckies or some other cause. But I do know and emphatically do state that the cough grew steadily worse until by the middle 1950 it seemed so severe that he used to choke whenever he was seized with the spasmodic cough & therefore decided to cease fire & change to Philip Morris while I have been smoking. He at first resented my intervention but I finally succeeded in persuading him to change to Philip Morris cigarettes which he has been smoking, I believe, for 7 months. His cough has improved perceptibly and I hope will disappear completely in due time. The attacks are also much less severe and still meet less frequent. Thank you Philip Morris. This is the real truth.

Sincerely yours

Harry J. Wolchuck, B.S.

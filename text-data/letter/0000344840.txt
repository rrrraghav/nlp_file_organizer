Dear Mr. Alona:

This is to confirm that the VICEROY brand indicated that it had no
interest in supplying product to be used in the shooting of your
production, "Big Wednesday."

Enclosed I am returning your script.

We appreciate you presenting this opportunity to us, and since each
of these opportunities are evaluated on an individual basis, it is
possible we may have an interest in future projects.

Sincerely,

Robert J. Busogny
Assistant Manager of
Public Relations

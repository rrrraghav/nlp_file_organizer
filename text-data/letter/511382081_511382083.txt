RE: 90-Day Plan

Following is the 90-Day Plan addressing the Corporate Affairs agenda which will be followed throughout 1994.

Briefly, I will detail the four (4) areas of accountability that will comprise the strategic focus.

Legislative Intervention
Build relationships and mutual understanding with political leadership at the national, state and local levels.

Contingency Building
Work primarily with minority organizations who share mutual business concerns and who qualify as prospective allies.

Sales/Marketing Activity
Work with Sales/Marketing to advise on business matters and develop programs that benefit minority markets.

Community Relations
Maintain relationships with national civic and social organizations through sponsorships and contributions while communicating corporate initiatives.

The areas of accountability detailed above will guide the development of the plan and the suggested actions (i.e., conferences, events) maintain consistency with the strategy.

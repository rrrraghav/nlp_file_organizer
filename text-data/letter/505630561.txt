Multiple Wave Couponing

A Winston Lights/Super King 50¢ coupon was distributed in April.
In two markets we multiple waved - the same households were sent
3 coupons each two weeks apart.

Results are still topline, in that final switching figures have not
been obtained. Information obtained to date suggests that multiple
waving may not be very effective as illustrated by the following
findings:

• Out of the possible three coupons, an average of only 1.3
coupons were redeemed per redeeming household.

• The percentage of competitive smokers decreases the more coupons
redeemed indicating, by and large, that we’re primarily rewarding
current franchise.

      1 Time        2 Time       3 Time
% Competitive   Redeemer     Redeemer    Redeemer
          32-5%         30.0%        20.8%
          24.7           33.3            21.2



Smokers who redeem two or three coupons are considerably older,
which is antithetical to most brands’ strategies.

      1 Time        2 Time       3 Time
Under 35     Redeemer     Redeemer    Redeemer
35 or older   35%          29%         19%
                65%           70          81%



Final judgment on multiple waving should be reserved, however,
until complete data is available and payout is determined -
the first of February.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed are three items I received recently bearing on smokers’ rights and proposed taxes and restrictions on the use of tobacco:

One is an article by Bruce Herschensohn published in HUMAN EVENTS newspaper titled "Let Free Market Decide Smoking Rules," a concept I totally agree with, as the free market has always proven to be far more effective than government regulation.

Another enclosure is a mailing I received (as publisher of a national newspaper) from a public relations firm including a short article on the subject of the regulation of tobacco use. Well written and full of useful information.

The final enclosure is a publication from Florida Tax Watch (a non-profit state government watchdog organization) expressing the unsound proposal of a proposed increase in the state tax on tobacco.

I hope you may be able to use some portion of these enclosures in your continuing efforts to protect the rights of smokers in our supposedly free country.

Sincerely,



JOHN McLEOD, Inc.

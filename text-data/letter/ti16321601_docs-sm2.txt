Dear Maurice,

The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the U.S. Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation would affect just about everyplace except one’s home.

The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact. While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your members.

It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially less frequency if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As I am certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level.

Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
Walker Merryman

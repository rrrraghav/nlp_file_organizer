Re: Doral - Tar & Nicotine Changes
Schechter + Luth Project No. 14-902

Dear Willard:

This is simply to confirm the very pleasant and productive day
Ernst and I spent with you and your associates yesterday.

As you know, we presented a variety of alternative treatments
for handling tar and nicotine numbers on the new Doral 20’s
wrapper and carton. A decision was reached on the recommended
method and we decided each of the seven mechanicals to incorporate
that change.

You have offered to send us photostatic copies of the altered
mechanicals for our records. Please ask your secretary to put
“September 9, 1977 - Final Tar and Nicotine Numbers” on each of
these photostats in order to avoid future confusion.

We also approved all of Arcler’s Ink colors with the exception of
the dark red which should be somewhat lighter.

Since the wrapper has already been proofed, the only proofing re-
maining should be for the carton and the sample 4’s. Because of
the delicate color balance we will of course remain available to
assist you in this regard.

Also remaining to be completed is modification of the wrapper and
carton comprehensives (filter & menthol) returned to us by Ed
Blackmer so as to be consistent with the final changes as shown
on the mechanicals. These will be completed and sent out to you
early next week.

Now that the project is drawing to a close, and the product is
about to be reintroduced, I must say that it has been, as usual,
a pleasure to work with you on it. The brand group has had a

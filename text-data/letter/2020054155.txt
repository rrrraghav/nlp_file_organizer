Dear John:

Enclosed is a copy of the recently issued EPO search report. As you will see from Nick Marlow’s letter, only one, USSR 971968, has not been considered in the prior art for the U.S. parent. Only an abstract is supplied. If you need the complete patent for translation, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Beverly A. Monroe

Dear Dr. Crane:

My attention has been called to your syndicated column
under the headline "Cigaret Smoke Can Ruin Blood Transfusion,"
in which you state that carbon monoxide permanently destroys red
blood cells. If this is the case, it is, of course, of great
practical importance and I would appreciate it very much if you
could refer me to the source of any evidence supporting your
statement.

It is, of course, well known that carbon monoxide has
a strong affinity for hemoglobin and displaces oxygen from oxy-
hemoglobin. However, according to current texts and other medical
writing, this is a reversible reaction. The amount of carbon
monoxide combined with my agent in time is determined by the
proportion of oxygen to carbon monoxide in the environment. This
is the basis for the use of oxygen in treating carbon monoxide
poisoning; thus promoting the rapid elimination of carbon monoxide
and speeding recovery.

Any scientific references you can send us which will
support your position would be most welcome.

Sincerely yours,

McKeen Cattell, M.D.

Larry-

This note is to let you know that the Corporate & Youth Responsibility group at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation is truly pleased with the results of the Initiative Towards SmokeFree Youth (“ITS Youth”) program sponsored through the Housing Authority of Louisville’s Youth Development program.

We received your report last week and noted the active involvement of participants, the positive curriculum, and the impressive results.

Congratulations on an excellent project so far. We encourage you to keep up the good work.

Sincerely yours,



C. G. Newton

Dear Jim:

I presume each member of the Steering Group received a cover note, a project goal description and a budget from Jack Kelly, like the enclosed one which came here and which you showed us in New York.

Surely we look for more than 600-800 cards from the survey of California’s “industry personnel,” which are discussed in item I entitled "Industry Inventory." I should think the industry would be defined broadly enough to garner several hundred thousand names. Perhaps there needs to be a hard core of 600-800 and, on top of that, a contact group on which we have names and addresses numbering in the hundreds of thousands. But all of this should be in the statewide tobacco action network.

My best regards.

Sincerely,

EP/dlt

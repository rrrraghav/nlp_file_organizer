January 2, 1998

To: All Sales Reps and Retail Reps with Pharmhouse/Rx Stores

Subject: Pharmhouse Stores (Chain ID 1122-00-00)

Mr. Ray Sanger, Buyer, has approved a distribution of Winston Box styles not currently in distribution to all stores. He has also authorized the brands permanent space on the pack and carton fixtures and a temporary 20 pack display for a one month period.

The brands will be shipped from either Stonel or Heckiner, depending upon the store supplier, the week of January 7,1998. The chain will handle the changes in the pack and carton plan-o-grams. I have forwarded a copy of the current plan-o-gram and changes that will be made by the chain.

The temporary display authorized by Mr. Sanger is for a one month period. On your next visit please contact the store manager and decide upon a viable location for the display. Please insure the ultra light box brands are in the display and the display is dated.

If you have any questions please contact me via voice mail.

Sincerely,



George Moulton

Dear Tony,

JPS

Many thanks for your letter dated 28th November, 1984.

It certainly makes sense that we await the product test
results before deciding on a blend change to JPS.

Having taken into account the urgency of the need as
well as the comparative relevance of the two pieces of research
for the Hong Kong market, we propose that we will make our
decision with reference to the Hong Kong product research only.
In other words we are prepared to consider 680-R, if it scores
well against MARLBORO and LUCKY STRIKE.

However, we will have to rely on B & W for the inter-
pretation of the research results, since neither the research
agency nor BAT (HK) have knowledge of the coding reference.

Kindly advise us of the joint recommendation by yourself
and B & W as soon as possible.

With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,

Allen C.K. Leung

Re: Project AA Menthol

As you requested, the Brand has conducted an analysis to determine the viability for introducing Project AA as a 100% Full Flavor and Fuller Flavor Low Tar menthol only brand family targeted at stylish females and selling at a premium price. The following advantages and disadvantages are apparent from this proposition:

Advantages

* Introducing AA as a menthol would give a separate reason for being to both AA and MG. Switching interaction would be minimal if AA were the menthol prestige positioned brand targeted toward women and MG were non-menthol prestige brand for men. In effect, this action would give each brand a separate, unique identity.

* Currently, there are no “stand alone” prestigious positioned menthol brands on the cigarette market. Female menthol smokers who desire feminine, stylish, prestigious image reinforcement must choose from B & H Deluxe Ultra Light, Players, Satin or Sterling. All four of these brands have menthol and non-menthol style alternatives which account for .89 and 1.21 % SOM respectively (as of May, 1984 YTD). Also, only Satin offers female intensive image reinforcement. There is a potential for AA, as a menthol FF/FLT style with a prestige, female image, to find a niche among these stylish/prestigious brands.

* A potential exists for increasing switching gains for AA from female Benson & Hedges Menthol (FF and FF/LT) and Virginia Slims Mentl (FF and FF/LT) given AA’s female specific image reinforce - t (which Benson & Hedges lacks) and AA's prestigious image reinforcement (which is not available in Virginia Sl - ).

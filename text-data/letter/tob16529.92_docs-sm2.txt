Dear Mr. Arnold:

I find it shocking that the firm of Arnold and Porter participated in behalf of the tobacco lobby in engineering, by perversion of Congress, the blocking of any significant health warning in cigarette advertising. According to the United States Public Health Service, three hundred thousand Americans are dying prematurely each year as a result of cigarette smoking.

I see little hope for achieving a decent society in this country as long as clever lawyers will do anything for money.

Sincerely yours,

Julian M. Sturtevant

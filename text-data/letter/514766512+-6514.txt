Re: Minneapolis Metro Heavy Advertising Test Results - Camel

Background

In August 1993 a heavy advertising test was initiated for Camel in the Minneapolis metro area. The purpose of the test was to assess whether heavier presence had an impact on market sales. The test included flighted OOH, continuous print, and multiple visuals, and the spending rate was at about double the national level.

With the 1994 budget squeeze, national advertising spending was reduced as was Minneapolis; however, the test area continued to receive support at about double the national rate. Also in April 1994, the Camel BU began a heavy retail plan that encompassed five regions and included Minneapois.

Methodology

We attempted to evaluate this test using traditional methods during 1993 (report issued 3/14/94 covering August-December 1993). Results from this early read indicated no noticeable impact on sales. With Minneapolis becoming a retail heavy-up market in 1994 and a shift in level of advertising support, this approach did not work for subsequent time periods.

We approached IRI about doing a modeled technique, but based on their cost estimate of $45,000 we elected not to go with them. Instead, we utilized internal resources and Don Schmidt in the BIAD Decision Support group developed the analytical approaches to assess this issue.

Three analytical approaches were utilized: simple trend, forecasted baseline, and a modeled covariate procedure. The more sophisticated techniques provide a way to try to separate out the effects of media from the other market effects that were going on at the time, particularly pricing and promotion. All three approaches led to the same overall conclusion.

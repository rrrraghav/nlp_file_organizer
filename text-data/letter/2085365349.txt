Dear Ina:

It was a pleasure to meet you, and Phil and I trust the Ohio race went well. Thank you for a very informative and exciting conversation. Phil and I have taken away a better understanding of the challenges that face Marlboro Racing. We want you to know that we are very dedicated to the creation of an effective Internet communications platform in support of the FSF and the content providers.

We are continuing our discovery process and look to a partnership within Philip Morris to create more effective, efficient and profitable methods of communication. Your input serves as value in support of the need and importance of promoting brand communications and brand events. We have heard you.

As we also mentioned, our capabilities are broad and could also serve as disciplines in support of your Marlboro Racing events. We have partnered with many companies to promote and support brand identity…from creating unforgettable customer and consumer events, generating exciting promotions, developing the environment, creating appealing and consistent new collateral and using top-notch entertainment to enhance any event. We work from an integrated approach through the conception, production and implementation of each and every event while delivering inspiring and flawless experiences.

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with us at this very exciting time of change and new possibilities! We will stay in touch.

Sincerely,

Anne M. Rabin

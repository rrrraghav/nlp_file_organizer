RJR Interoffice Memorandum

Subject: BRIGHT 85/100 Date: January 4, 1984
1984 Flavor Development

To: Dr. D. L. Roberts From: R. F. McCarthy

The recent visit to Biddle Sawyer was very encouraging with regard to the improved flavor components which were reviewed for the BRIGHT filter flavor system. The deterpinated hearts of peppermint represent a giant step forward in the fact that they will move us closer to a filter flavor system which can be quantitatively/qualitatively monitored. Although we are at an impasse at this time in being able to monitor the current filter flavor system, it is imperative that we not lose sight of this objective in 1984. It is requested that all filter flavor development work be directed toward simplifying and reducing the number of flavor components added to the filter. A revised flavor system with only peppermint hearts in the dillema would be of the greatest interest in recognition of the current dilemma of not being able to monitor peppermint on our current products.

In addition to the present flavor improvement work which is currently underway, it is requested that the aforementioned approach be assigned a level of importance and priority that is commensurate with any flavor improvement work in 1984.

Please advise if there are any questions or concerns.

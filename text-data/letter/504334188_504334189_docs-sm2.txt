ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF

• Solvent Residues - Methodology recommendations for use by QA
in monitoring wrapping materials for ink solvent residues were
reviewed and discussed. The portable photoionization detector
"sniffer" will be used for routine in-plant analysis.
Capillary GC will be used to ensure "sniffer" performance and
to follow up on borderline shipments. The “sniffer” has been
transferred to QA for initial use in Factory No. 64.

• National Library Week Celebration - National Library Week was
celebrated in the R&D Library April 15-19. This was a great

and library automation. The week was highly successful
in reaching new users and creating a genuine interest in
learning more about library services.

image analysis and advanced automation was presented to R&D
executive management. The presentation included:

    - Identification of RJR opportunities for cost savings
      applications.
    - A process of R&D interaction with the several RJR
      Companies.

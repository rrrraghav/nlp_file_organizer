Dear Joe:

In response to your letter of March 27, we are proposing herewith for your consideration four question areas.

(1) Why does the non-smoker not smoke? Is it because he dislikes the taste of cigarettes, or because he does not feel the need to indulge in smoking which is considered bad? Is it because he is apprehensive from a health standpoint? Under what circumstances would the non-smoker be willing to take up smoking?

(2) What is the public image of the requirements of a cigarette package? Should the package contain ten, twenty, or thirty cigarettes? Should it be soft and collapsible, or should it be hard like the flip-top box? Does the public feel that the package is unsatisfactory from the functional point of view; that is, that it permits the cigarettes to dry out too quickly, etc.? What would the public reception be to a new modern looking, more functional package combining features of both box and flip top, same furnished.

(3) What appeal does the idea of a modern design or a dual filter such as the dual-filter Tareytan, have to the public? Does the public appreciate the value and significance of this as a filter improvement? Would the public respond more favorably to a sales appeal pointing out the improvement which this filter affords over regular single-element filters? Note that Tareytan advertising does not stress the newness and originality of their filter design, but rather the flavor impairment which results therefrom. Most filter cigarettes have less “flavor” than nonfilters. Can we measure how many people are willing to sacrifice "flavor" for "filter protection."

Dear Mr. Miller:

Thank you for letting us know you recently were sold some
Camel Lights cigarettes marked “Complimentary, Not For
Sale.”

Periodically, through our sales force, we provide re-
tailers displays of "Free Pack" offers to help promote
sales of certain brands. As long as the supply lasts, a
customer purchasing a package of this particular brand is
entitled to another pack marked “Complimentary, Not For
Sale.”

Although our sales force continually encourages retailers
to merchandise our various promotional offers properly,
apparently the cigarettes you wrote about were not mer-
chandised as we had intended.

We are sorry this happened and hope you will enjoy the
additional cigarettes being sent to you under separate
cover with our compliments.

Sincerely,

Ann Griffin
Public Relations Department

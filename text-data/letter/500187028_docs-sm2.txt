R.J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY

WINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA

February 25, 1964

Dear Fellow Employee:

Yesterday a special report was given to you concerning the Company’s activities for 1963. While much of this report carried information from the annual 1963 shareholders' report (mailed to all stockholders last Thursday), space did not permit it to carry all of a statement we made to the many people who have invested in the Company. We feel that the statement is just as important to you and would like to share it with you now:

“Like all members of the tobacco industry -- which includes growers, warehouses, processors, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers -- the Company is confronted with problems resulting from the report of the Surgeon General’s Committee on Smoking and Health which was released on January 11, 1964. It will face these problems realistically in a continuing effort to do what is best for the users of its products, for its stockholders and for employees, for the communities in which it operates, and for the industry of which it is a part. It will continue to support an intensified research program designed to find truly scientific answers to the complex problems of smoking and health -- from the growing and processing of tobacco to the methods of its use. It is confident that the combined efforts of government and the industry will eventually point the way to a solution, satisfactory from the standpoint of public health and the tobacco business.”

To show that your Company already has suited its words to action, there are reprinted on the next page two newspapers' stories announcing recent grants of funds by the tobacco industry for intensifying and expanding basic research. Your Company is a substantial contributor to both programs.

Sincerely,

Brammerda
Chairman

President

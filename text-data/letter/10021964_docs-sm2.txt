Dear Doctor Lionetti:

The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A., Inc. is pleased to award
a renewal grant in the amount of $48,990 for the period December 1, 1981 through
November 30, 1982 for the study proposed in your application dated June 2, 1981.

It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by the
institutional authorities, as hereto attached.

Since it concludes the period originally programmed for this study,
it is considered terminal for the project, and a comprehensive final report will be
expected at your convenience after its termination, as well as reprints of any
papers resulting from the grant research.

New proposals may be acceptable for consideration de novo in competition
for available funds in the light of program status and priorities at the time of
submission. If you aim to submit any such proposals, it will be well to send in
formal outlines of the proposed work in advance, as early as possible, so that our
program planning group can advise you whether formal application can be recommended.
These may be handled through your CTR staff contact.

Your attention is particularly called to the enclosed "Important Procedural
Information for Grantees."

Dr. Muriel T. Lionetti, Associate Research Director, will continue to re-
present our scientific staff as primary contact with your grant. She will be the per-
son to consult about any questions or problems that may arise, and should be kept
informed about the progress of the study.

Please fill in the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to

me.

Sincerely,

Robert F. Gertenbach

encis.

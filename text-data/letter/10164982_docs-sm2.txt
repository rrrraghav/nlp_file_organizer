Dear Dr. Weinbaum:

I will be pleased to continue our electron microscopic research
of the ultrastructure of the alveolar septum in collaboration with the
research laboratories of Albert Einstein Medical Center. I will be
involved in the development of techniques for the specific
localization of myeloperoxidase, microfibrillar elastin and neutrophil
elastase. I will also be involved in evaluating the earliest changes
seen at the ultrastructural level resulting from the induction of
emphysema by neutrophil elastase.

Sincerely yours,

V.D. Damiano

Dear Friend of Carrie Meek:

Plans are continuing to shape up for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s 23rd Annual Legislative Weekend, September 15-19, at the Washington (D.C.) Convention Center. For your consideration I've enclosed a preliminary schedule of events and associated costs. There is not a registration fee for the CBC weekend Issue Forums and Braintrusts; however, registration is required.

Issue Forums are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday at the Washington Convention Center. The Braintrusts will be held on Friday in committee rooms on Capitol Hill.

Fashion show, two shows, Saturday 8 p.m., and Sunday 12 noon. This year’s theme: A Return to Oz. After Friday's fashion show there will be a benefit concert featuring either Chaka Kahn or Gladys Knight.

The keynote speaker for Saturday night’s awards dinner has yet to be decided. Bernard Shaw of CNN will serve as the Master of Ceremonies and entertainment will be provided by the O’Jays and Levert.

I realize that attending the CBC weekend is quite an expensive proposition considering airfare and housing costs. However, I would like to encourage as many of you who can afford to attend to do so. The Braintrust and the Issue Forums are usually very thought provoking. The social events are usually very nice, but trying to attend all of them could cost you an arm and a leg. So use your own judgement.

On Friday evening Congresswoman Meek will host a complimentary reception on roof top terrace of the Madison Building of the Library of Congress for her friends from Miami.

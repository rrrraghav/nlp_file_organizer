    We have completed our preliminary review of the
economic impact of implementing the proposed "Clean Indoor
Air" ordinance in Dade County, Florida. The purpose of this
review was to identify areas of impact, roughly estimate
magnitudes of these impacts and to develop study approaches
for a more detailed estimate in areas where impact appears
significant. This letter summarizes the results of this
preliminary review.



Work done

    In performing this review we have studied the
proposed ordinance, analyzed a similar impact study made for
the State of California in connection with the proposed
"Proposition 5", compiled data for Dade County about the
number of facilities and employees in different categories
which could be impacted, performed some small surveys
to evaluate assumptions which had been made in
connection with the California survey, and computed an
impact using cost factors which were developed as a part of
the California study adjusted for the results of our local
surveys and interviews.



Problems encountered

    Based upon our review we believe that there will be
a near term cost impact in Dade County in the Public and
Private Sectors. In attempting to quantify this impact we
encountered the following difficulties:

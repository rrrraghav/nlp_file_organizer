INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM



R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company





                                       July 24, 1985

TO: Dr. G. R. Di Marco

SUBJECT: Weekly Highlights
          Process Technology & Development

I. NEW PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

   o Carbonization of Stems

      In PT&D’s ongoing work to support use of carbonized
      tobacco in products, a novel method of carbonizing stems
      is under development. Bench scale tests are underway
      utilizing plasma arc welding equipment to simultaneously
      and virtually instantaneously deliver extremely high
      temperatures directly to the stems in an inert atm-
      osphere thus avoiding ignition of the stems. This work
      could lead to a continuous method of carbonizing vs. the
      current batch methods which take times ranging from 1
      to 5 days, depending on batch size.

II. PT&D SUPPORT SERVICES

   o Freon Storage in 611-7

      The Freon storage tank originally at Shed 130 has been
      relocated to the East end of 611-7. The tank will
      provide increased storage capacity and will free space
      inside 611-7 to better support G-13 developmental
      activities.

   o Protos Stem Extraction

      Support is continuing for the Protos stem extraction
      project with data for the second phase submitted on
      July 19 as requested. Additional testing is expected.

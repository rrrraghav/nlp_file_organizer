Dear

Thank you for your generous support of Action on Smoking and Health during 2000! As you know, all your contributions are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. The receipt below reflects your contributions for the past year, and is provided to assist you in preparing your tax returns for 2000.

Noninal partnership enabled us to continue our efforts to protect the rights and health of NONSMOKERS, and to undertake important new initiatives. As you well know, ASH continues to push two exciting and promising initiatives – our petition to force OSHA to issue rules restricting smoking in all workplaces, and our work with the World Health Organization to restrict the spread of tobacco throughout the world.

For nearly 34 years ASH has relied on people like you who have a personal stake in this battle. As I’ve told you before, we get no support from the government, no money from the giant tobacco settlements and end not a penny from any well-publicized law suit. No, all of our support comes from men and women like you who understand the importance of our work. You have my sincere thanks.

Sincerely,

John F. Banzhaf III
Executive Director and General Counsel

P.S. As we prepare for our next Board of Trustees meeting – when our 2001 budget will be approved - I ask you to consider a special contribution to help us fully fund our programs for the upcoming year. Your generosity is the only way we can continue our critical work.

Mr. A. B. Clarke
Director of Sales Operations

Dear A. B.:

Thanks very much for your quick reaction to the Eastern
Airlines plan to limit smoking seats on its flights to
35%.

Your voluntary action as a private citizen was an important
help to B&W and the tobacco industry in attempts to counter-
act this new threat to take cigarettes away from many smokers
on airplanes.

Cordially,

J. Kendrick Neils, III

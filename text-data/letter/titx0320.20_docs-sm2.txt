RE: NOI-CR-05681

Dear Mr. Townsend:

In response to your letter of November 1, 1981, Kaiser
Foundation Research Institute will discontinue using form
HEW 515 and for the future submit Financial Reports on form
HEW 646 as specified.

Please be advised that our invoices covering the costs for the
months of October and November, 1981 will be delayed due to
our funding problems with Enviro Control, Inc. As soon as we
have more definite information, we will be in touch with you.
In the meantime, we hope you will understand the need for this
delay.

Sincerely,

W. Lee
Gilbert W. Lee
Manager, Research Accounting

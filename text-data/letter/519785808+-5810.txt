MEMORANDUM TO: AREA VICE PRESIDENTS





SUBJECT: “DEEPER” PROMOTION COVERAGE (DPC)

of this Done



At our recent meetings in Phoenix and Philadelphia, we had a lot of discussion on the important role distributors will play in implementing our promotions in 1996. We spent time discussing the money we spent on DPC in 1995, the issues, the program abuse, and our collectaccountabilities going forward.

Over the past several weeks, Denny Borgardner has been streamlining our promotion execution reports to ensure we have the right measurements/tools in place to assess our effectiveness right from the beginning of DPC. In reviewing the reports (see attached), it reinforces that we really did an awful job with DPC. My intent is not to beat a “dead dog,” instead, we need to take corrective steps, get ahead of the curve, and fix it for 1996.

Please contact your RSMs and put the wheels in motion now. As information, Denny Borgardner is putting together material for the Region Meetings in January, and this promotion execution measurement tool will be included as part of a 3P discussion.

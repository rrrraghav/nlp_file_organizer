Dear Helmut:

Your Telex of 03/12/75 was delayed in transmission. The following is the best information we have concerning the IUPAC names for the compounds:

Anisic Ketone - 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanone

Oxanone Crystals - 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone

Iso-pentaldehyde - 3-methylbutanal

Tolyi Aldehyde - Mixed isomers of 2,3, and 4-methylbenzene carbonal

Rose of Latakia Wine - Compound Flavor obtained from a Flavor House – Basically an extract of raisins with added flavors. These are on List "A" but do not include the lactate.

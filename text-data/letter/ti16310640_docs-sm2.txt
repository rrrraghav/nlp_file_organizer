Dear Committee Members:

On behalf of The Tobacco Institute, I am pleased to enclose herewith our contribution to the O’Bannon for Indiana Committee. The Tobacco Institute recognizes that good citizenship includes involvement in the political process and giving support to candidates who give full and careful consideration to all sides of an issue.

Accordingly, after consultation with our legislative consultant, Tom Fruechtenicht, we are delighted to offer our support of the political process.

Best regards,

Bob Pruett
Regional Vice President

Dear Mr. Campbell:

Mr. Remes’s letter indicates that you cannot commit at this time to providing the Subcommittee the documents described in section 6 of the September 15 draft of the procedures. These documents are those that contain formulas for currently marketed products; trade secrets relating to a product or technology that is a trade secret and is being used or under active research and development; or plans for future marketing and advertising. You propose to make these documents available for review in the Subcommittee offices and, if they should be needed by the Subcommittee, to confer in good faith on procedures for handling the documents.

As reflected in enclosed proceedings, the Subcommittee will follow this approach as it applies to any remaining proprietary product formulas. As to the other documents described in section 6 of the September 15 draft, I expect your company to supply these to the Subcommittee if they are requested after further consideration process. However, the Subcommittee will not pursue this matter until the other issues arise over the handling of actual meetings.

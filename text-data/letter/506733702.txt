MR. R. A. KAMPE
Re: EEC Strategic Approach

David Beazley and I developed the attached to reflect the strategic approach agreed to in our London meeting on September 21.

I have reviewed this draft with Dale Sisel and he is in full agreement. I should emphasize that we are not positioning this as a change in strategy, since the U.K. has always been regarded as our second priority to Germany, but rather as an acceleration of the U.K. test market timing.

If you concur, we plan to use this strategic approach as a basis for developing the revised German plan and the U.K. plan.

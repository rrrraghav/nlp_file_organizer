Dear Member:

The enthusiastic response to our previous edition of the
Washington State Guide to Business and Industry has exceeded our
greatest expectations. The guide has proven itself virtually
indispensable to Washington Businesses.

Preparation for the new edition is now beginning. The new
edition will be an invaluable tool for promoting business among
Association members and non-members alike. Nowhere else will you find
a complete guide to the goods
and services of members exclusively.

In addition to the directory section and business guide, we
will be upgrading the one hundredth anniversary color section of the Guide.
This new section will include profiles of Washington’s businesses
and their expanded editorial on such topics as tourism, finance,
regional development and international relations. Our deluxe
edition will be printed on heavier stock paper and be
handsomely bound in a high quality cover.

The widely respected Windsor Publications will be producing
the book, and I have asked their representative to contact you
personally to show you the new layout and its additional
features. To request a specific appointment, please return the
enclosed reply card promptly.



Sincerely,




Donald L. Barber
President

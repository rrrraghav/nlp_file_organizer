Dear Mr. Austern:

As requested, I have examined the date records consisting of laboratory determination calculation sheets and statistical summary sheets which you represented to me to be copies of the original laboratory data sheets compiled by the Federal Trade Commission and used as the basis for figures on "tar" TPM (Dry) and nicotine yields of various brands of cigarettes as well as the final reports on these data released by the Federal Trade Commission.

It was the laboratory data sheets for the “tar” and nicotine figures released by the Federal Trade Commission under the date December 1981 which I examined and upon which I report in this letter.

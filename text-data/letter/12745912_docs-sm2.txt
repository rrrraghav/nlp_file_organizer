Gentlemen:

Arrangements have been made to conduct a street sampling promotion on behalf of CARLITON 100’s Filter and Menthol Cigarettes in Washington, D. C. Details are as follows:

Timing : See schedule below

Items : 106,800 packages CARLITON 100’s Filter 20s
46,200 packages CARLITON 100’s Menthol 20s
153,000 CARLITON Visitors Maps of Washington

Distributing Agency: Federal Distributing Corp.
777 Third Avenue
New York, New York
Phone (212) 355-0606

Contact : Mr. Kenneth Greenfield

Shipping : The Sample 20s, bearing “Complimentary – Not for Sale” closure stamps and Visitors Maps will be shipped direct to Federal Distributing Corp., c/o ADW/Quinn, 12024 Baltimore Pike, Beltsville, Maryland, marked for the attention of Mr. Bruce Quatrone.

This street promotion will be conducted two days a week over a four-week period and our major objective is to sample the tourist trade rather than the local people. Consequently plans are to be made outlining key visitor locations which attract mostly out-of-town tourists. After these locations have been selected, a meeting should be held with Mr. Greenfield to coordinate the plan, selection of samplers, etc.

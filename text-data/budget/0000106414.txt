RALEIGH/BELAIR DOUBLE COUPON NATIONAL INTRODUCTION

If it is decided to nationally launch the RALEIGH/BELAIR Double
Coupon program, it is anticipated that an incremental $3,750,000 will
be spent in a three month period. Three million in advertising covers
use of Sunday supplements, outdoor, and newspaper in above average
sales areas for the brands. Seven hundred and fifty thousand is
allocated to sales promotion to fund a second major brand promotion
for RALEIGH/BELAIR. (Each brand was allocated only one major brand
promotion during 1976).

An additional $3,000,000 is currently being considered on top of the $3,750,000.
Consumer research indicates low competitive smoker awareness of the
Double Coupon program in the test markets. It is believed that this additional
money may be needed to achieve a substantial level of competitive smoker
awareness to generate trial among non RALEIGH/BELAIR smokers.

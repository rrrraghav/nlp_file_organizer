During the month of March Ames tests were completed on 6 compounds obtained from Dr. J. Reid in Organic Chemistry. Two compounds of interest to us were assayed for mutagenicity also. Preliminary testing was begun on 6 other compounds from Dr. Reid to determine toxicity to tester strains used in the Ames Assay.

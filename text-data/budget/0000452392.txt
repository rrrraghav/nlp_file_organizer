REVISED 1988 INDUSTRY SHIPMENT AND CONSUMPTION VOLUME/SHARE ESTIMATES

Further assessment of 1988 and 1989 shipments versus consumption has concluded
that the industry shipment volume is approximately 20% higher than previously
estimated, thus revising a revised 1988 “best guess” estimate for industry
shipments to 350.2 billion dollars.

Hawell in his published export indicates that industry shipments will be
approximately 364 billion dollars. This revision is based on the fact that
the volume of exports has been higher than previously estimated. The previous
estimate was based on a 1987 base year and limited data. We also assume that
1989 shipments will increase approximately 5% over 1988.

Table 1 extracted summarises share of shipment and share of consumption estimates
for the industry, as well as for the major sub-sectors. The 1987 estimate
of $31.32 with resultant shares. & Hawell’s original 1988 estimated industry
shipment volume was $340 billion dollars. This revised estimate of industry
shipments of $350.2 with resultant shares, and 6 revised MAP’s.

The share of consumption among our four sub-sectors will be approximately
a 37% for the “high end” group, a 28% for the “middle” group, a 21%
for the “low end” group, and a 14% for the “specialty” group. The share of
consumption remains at 11.6%.

Table 2 summarises share of shipment estimates of $35.6 for industry shipments(
$35.6 billion) for our nationwide 1989 estimate, an estimated 1989?
shipment volume of approximately $370 billion dollars.

The revised estimates and multiple of State tax return data from 1977
to 1987 indicate that the industry shipment volume is approximately 20% higher
than the previously revised 1988 “best guess” estimate for industry
shipments of $350.2 billion dollars.

Table 1 extracted summarises share of shipment and consumption among client
companies, as well as for the major sub-sectors with estimates for 1988 and 1989.

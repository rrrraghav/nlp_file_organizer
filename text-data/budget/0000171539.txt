VICEROY TRIAL 10 PACKS

APRIL, 1984

PROMOTION OVERVIEW

This outlines a test program which when implemented on a national
level will generate up to a projected 5.4MM targeted competitive
trials and 107M converters (.18% SOM). To meet a one year breakeven
objective, the promotion needs only to generate an additional .03%
or 150MM units. This test program is a component of the approved
1984 Plan.

The test program consists of offering 300M trial 10 packs, requiring
a minimal investment from consumers in order to produce serious trial
among competitive smokers. A $.25 on pack coupon will further streng-
then trial, increasing the probability of usage upgrading/conversion.

Bay City, MI (TA 64) and Grand Rapids, MI (TA 65) are the designated
test markets. These markets represent high and average SDI markets,
respectively and 2.1% of national VICEROY sales.

The budgeted cost of the test is $50,000.

A. Promotion Objectives

Generate the national equivalent of an increase of at least .03%
(150MM units) share to achieve a one year payback from 5.4MM
targeted competitive trials.

B. Promotion Strategies

1. Provide 300M trial 10 packs in all VICEROY styles to target
stores, requiring minimal consumer investment.

2. Price trial pack at level which indicates a “clear” value
to the consumer. This suggested 10’s pack price is .45% of 20's
pack selling price. This price level will cover
variable manufacturing costs and applicable state tax while
allowing for maintenance of distributor and retailer mar-
gins comparable to a 20’s pack.

3. Deliver $.25 on-pack coupon good on future 20’s pack or
carton purchase.

4. Initiate test in Bay City, MI (TA 64) and Grand Rapids, MI
(TA 65) representing 2.1% of national VICEROY sales. Markets
chosen represent high (130) and average (114) SDI markets,
respectively.

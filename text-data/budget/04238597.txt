In the pyrolysis of cellulose, more than 40 compounds were observed on the gas chroma-
tograms. Sixteen of these products have been identified, and 7 of them were major
products. The preliminary result showed that the yield of these products depends
on the temperature and the duration of pyrolysis. Some of these products increased
with the increase of temperature which others increased first and then decreased when
the temperature went up further. The yield of many major products also increased
as the duration of pyrolysis increased, however, a decrease of yields was observed
when the pyrolysis time was prolonged.

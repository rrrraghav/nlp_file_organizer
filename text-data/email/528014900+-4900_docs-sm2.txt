Cattaragus County, NY - At recent public hearing, county legislators heard five retailers speak out against the self-service display ban proposal and only one citizen speak for it.
The legislators decided to re-refer the bill to committee because they said it was too broad the way it was written. They won’t bring it back until after Labor Day at the very earliest. Over in Chautauqua County, the legislators will consider exempting cigars and making a “3 foot from the register” exception for smokeless when an amendment is heard in the next month.
This could give cigarette retailers an opportunity to go Back-in my maybe at least get some space on the counter - not just behind it or the cigar, smokeless drug chain, with five stores in the county - is mainly pushing hard to get an exception.

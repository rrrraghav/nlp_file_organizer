Subject: YSP Asian Parent Print Approvals Next Week

I have set up a few appointments next week to get Sr. Mgmt. approval on our YSP Asian parent print executions. Here's the schedule:

Ellen Merlo: Monday, 2/7 @ 10:00
Nancy Lund: Tuesday 2/8 @ 4:00 (tent)
Mike Szymanezyk: Friday, 2/11@ 8:30
Steve Parrish: TBD

I'm pushing these approvals through next week because if we don’t get them through, Marti and I are pretty much gone after 2/11 for the next three weeks; Jodi on vacation and Marti on relocation the week of 2/14, then shoots from 2/21 to 3/6.

In the meantime; we will be looking at the layouts again to make sure the SGW is prominent enough. The layouts are very simple, so we recommend leaving the SGW at its current size and taking down the YSP/PMUSA identifier size. No problem.

Additionally, we will get the Asian print readership information we talked about yesterday. I expect this information will be mostly qualitative--many of the news papers are probably not audited.

Let me know if you have any issues with our plan for next week. I know the in language work hasn’t been screened yet by Legal. We'll incorporate any necessary copy changes--overall I’m feeling pretty confident the work is in good shape so I want to keep it moving.

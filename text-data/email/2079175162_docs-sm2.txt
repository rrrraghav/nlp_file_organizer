Subject: 202 Creative Overlay agency meeting with Mike Mahan

This message is from Gina Fawcett (computer upgrade time...)

This meeting has been scheduled for Friday January 5, from 11-1, in Bal12. A preliminary look at calendars showed many of us are free at this time.

As you may be aware, after our brainstorming meeting with Burnett, the agency took our input and comments, as well as the ideas generated from our internal discussion, and compiled them into a book, which will be distributed over the next few days. What is coming in to Mike on the 5th is a lighter presentation of the top ideas discussed at that meeting. You also may want to look at the book, because some of the ideas did not make it into the creative overlay presentation, but may be worthy of more attention at the individual group level.

If you have any questions about this process or the meeting itself, please see Gina Fawcett or Gabrielle Guimond.

Thanks, Gina

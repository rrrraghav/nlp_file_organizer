Subject: Endotoxin in smoke

Dear Debbie:

At the meeting with Ragnar Rylander on Aug. 24, 1999, we discussed the endotoxin issue. Please find attached a draft concept for a pilot study to qualitatively and quantitatively ascertain the claimed endotoxin delivery to mainstream smoke.

Ragnar has the LAL assay established in his laboratory in a version that allows the distinction of the endotoxin-or plus Proluron LAL response. He would also be willing to do the tests on water has the material available to do the comparison of unwashed and washed samples.

We further discussed the potential bioassay to determine the biological effect of the washing. Normally, we see a reduction in the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in the bronchoalveolar space. We found this effect in the bronchioles after exposure to mainstream smoke at concentrations of 100 ug total particulate matter or higher. The question to be tested would be whether the washing would shift the threshold for the PMNL influx to lower concentrations. To do this, we would need to test a range of endotoxin concentrations per type of cigarette. The inhalation period would be 21 days. With approximately 1500 cigarettes per group and day, and 3 groups to test the setup, we would need approximately 110,000 cigarettes per type for a full-blown biological analysis.

I would appreciate your thoughts on that process. If you agree, we then would need to pass the concept for the pilot study through the concept review board for INB/FOG/CRC projects.

Best regards,

Hans-Juergen

You wrote a note on the cover page of the EMI agreement asking - I haven’t seen the QFTW informational form - have I?

I am not sure what an informational form is, we are schedule to present to you QFTW detail on 2/6. If you need any additional information prior to this presentation, please let me know.

Thx

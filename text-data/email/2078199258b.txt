Subject: RE: NH Smoking Ban Bill Proposed Testimony

We haven’t set up a conference call for this, however we can. Several schedules have changed around here, including Matt's. I’m waiting for him to get back to me on a time for this afternoon. Once we have that locked, we can set up a dial-in number. In the mean time, the extra time that we have will hopefully provide you and Paula with the ability to review the draft testimony sent earlier that was reviewed/approved by Ellen and Mark pending your input.

Enclosed you will find an ingredient disclosure that has been prepared for brands sold in the U.K.

By way of background the U.K. House of Commons Health Committee requested ingredient information from PM&R last week. They provided this information by February 20th. I am told that the other U.K. companies are prepared to respond and will be providing some form of disclosure by this date.

The proposal is to have our list forwarded by David Davies to the U.K. Department of Health and the U.K. House of Commons Health Committee. The format for this disclosure was developed in consultation with the U.K. Department of Health in November of last year except for the fact that the earlier aflare coded (and did not identify) brand names. The House of Commons specifically requested un-coded information.

There are also outstanding requests in Ireland and Australia. The disclosure format that would be used in Australia and in all likelihood Ireland would include a company list of flavors and a company list of non-tobacco materials.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the approach being proposed in greater detail.

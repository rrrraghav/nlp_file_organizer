Subject: Appeal ASHRAE 62e

Ms. Caidas:

I am responding to your request for preferences of dates for the appeal
hearing on ASHRAE 62e. My preference is December 2, 1999 or February 3,
2000.

I am also writing in response to your notification of the proposed panel
members for my appeal. I notice that Nancy Trayey is
employed by NIST. For your information, the Chair of ASHRAE SSPC 62.1, the
ASHRAE committee responsible for ASHRAE 62e, is Andrew
Persily, a NIST employee. I therefore would ask that ANSI consider excluding
Ms. Trayey from the panel.

Thank you for your consideration.

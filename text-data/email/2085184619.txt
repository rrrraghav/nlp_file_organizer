Tod:

Since you wanted to train your file coordinators as soon as possible, we were able to reserve meeting space at the
120 building for Monday, May 7th and Tuesday, May 8. Sessions will start at 8:30 am on Monday and Tuesday and
end at 5:00 pm on Monday and 4:30 pm Tuesday. Please advise as to whether this is acceptable for your group and
we will finalize the agenda. Thanks.

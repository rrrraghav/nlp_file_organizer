We started working on the cover note to the three parent storyboards we want to add to YSP Info Kit. And, there are some holes. Can you guys please review the enclosed document. It is modeled after the byen packet currently in the kit. Let us know if we got it right and help fill in numbers for other two ads.

C.J.L.: I was thinking about faxing over to jane to see if they could fill in secondary research section. Pls advise.

Subject: EPA Proposal re. use of Phosphine

The EPA published a Reregistration Evaluation Decision ("RED") on the use of aluminum and magnesium phosphide fumigants. The RED details concerns about the health effects associated with these fumigants, including those storing any type of grain. The EPA developments therefore may impact Kraft and Miller, as well as clearly impacting PM USA.

Denise received notice of the EPA action through Jack Nelson and I previously discussed with Jack Holleran, who is monitoring developments from a legal perspective for PM USA. Jack H provided the following website address for a fact sheet on the RED - "http://www.epa.gov/REDs/0205/0205fact.pdf"

Jan - will you please make inquiries to determine if Miller and Kraft are monitoring recent developments related to the use of the fumigants?

Eric - will you please ask Larry Culleen to review the recent EPA publication and outline the re-registration process for us?

Thanks very much.

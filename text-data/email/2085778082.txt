Status update.

Dear Joanne,

Please see the attached revised markup for your review and approval. I’ve incorporated all of the changes we discussed during our meeting yesterday.

I'm particularly interested in your feedback on the new language regarding the warranty clause. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Mark Berlin

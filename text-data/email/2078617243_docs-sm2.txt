Keith,

As today, I can’t have a precise date when the chargers will be cleared for
external use. I would like to ask you if you would accept to use unbranded USA
chargers (110V) equipped with an adapter (bought in Switzerland and in
Holland). Please let me know you thought about that proposal in order or us to
further explore that possibility.

Regarding the extended test lot do you foresee to distribute to the consumers
a user guidemanual? If yes, are they ready?

Regards.

Marc

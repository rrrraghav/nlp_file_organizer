Amir,

Glad your tooth is better.

We have to quickly come up with a recommendation on how best to dial up the trial offers (by 50c) for Cambridge.
The focus is an offensive.
We will need to loop in Rahul for optimizing offers and redemption rates (based on Basic learning).

Because this is a last minute thing for the April mailing we need to move quickly, review tomorrow and finalize with
brand by Monday.
Thanks,
Margaret

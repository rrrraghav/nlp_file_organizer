File(s): I&I budget

enclosed is the revised budget for our group which Marc approved. I still need to see how it fits into the overall picture, which I’ve yet to assemble due to everyone else's delays getting approved budgets to me.

I’d appreciate it if you would both keep this in mind as we go forward in 1996, and if significant projects arise that would throw us over budget, we will need to request more funds. Similarly, if we see that the projects are running under budget, we will have to reassess our needs and should reallocate any unused funds to other line items or projects.

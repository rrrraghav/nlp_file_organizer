Subject: web site
I agree with both of Ted's responses (the two paragraphs below) regarding this ETS paper. I have to comment that it is important to me that the maintenance of the web site re scientific issues needs to have scientific control at a broad level. The current situation where articles could easily be added by individuals, or the articles that make it are ones which receive media attention.

Here were Ted's comments:
He feels that the issue is quite important. He also feels that simply reviewing this article will not necessarily get us (WSA) to the point that we need to be, but that we rather need to review the entire literature on this subject. He says it’s a very complex area and he finds it interesting, but that much more work needs to be done to put them into perspective. As already indicated, he feels that the requisite effort is important to us and will do it. However, that you won't get quickly.

I assume that you are referring to the article by William P. Barnett, et al., entitled "Environmental Tobacco Smoke, Genetic Susceptibility, and Risk of Lung Cancer in Never-Smokers," published in Journal of the National Cancer Institute (91: 2009-2014, 1999). I have not yet read this article; however, Tony Tricker has. Tony’s opinion is that it is an extremely poor article and he feels that its conclusions are not supported by the data presented in the article. His conclusions are not consistent with his own. Tony is sufficiently concerned with the quality of the article that he is drafting a potential letter to the editor right this minute. He will finished it today, and I will discuss it with Rick next week. We will be more than happy to keep you in the loop.

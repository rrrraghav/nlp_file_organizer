Media Blocks

Parliament presented brand plans to Mike and Bob on Friday. Mike requested a plan and $ needed if we were to consider expanding Parliament’s media support to all of Region 1 (Bangor). Since we are already print in all of R1, this is an OOH exercise. Could you please have the Agency work up a budget for 1996 and include appropriate levels needed for first-time OOH in those markets. I will need the plan by November 13th.

In the end, we can prioritize markets contingent upon any incremental $ received. I’d like to submit a plan for all R1-Bangor going in. I'm here if you have any questions.

Lauren - In the meantime while the media folks are looking at all markets (Bangor) in Region 1 equally, please pull Parliament’s share in each R1 market and look at marrying with RDM by market in order for prioritize markets (if needed) based on any incremental dollars received. We may want to go down to the county level?? Thanks

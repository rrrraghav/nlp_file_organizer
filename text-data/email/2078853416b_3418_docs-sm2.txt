Subject: Website Translation Follow-up (CEMA/VEE)

The outside counsel that Cagatay is working with on the Turkish translation sent him a list
of terms from the PM website for which they require additional explanation in order to
translate.

Given the varying foreign words and phrases which could be used to translate these terms,
I prepared the list below, which I thought I should share with all of you to the extent similar
questions arise with your translations. These are only rough explanations intended
to offer some guidance for the translators. It is crucial that you check
with your local factories or operations people. For smoking and health terms, you should
review local public health messages and media articles and make sure that the translators
are using commonly-used and understandable terms describing the relevant word or
concept.

Please feel free to call me for explanations of other terms for which you or the translators
require further explanation.

Kind regards,

Jamie

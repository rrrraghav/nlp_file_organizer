Subject: FW: Design Control article for ITL

Importance: High

Urs - The attached brief article has been drafted for THE LOOP® publication. It's
a warm-up article - with larger articles to come in future editions.

I think it really points out the reason for Design Control ("...it’s good business...") and
I think it will help us build awareness for the design control process. I hope you like
it!

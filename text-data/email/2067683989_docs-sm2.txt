Subject: 2002 Mechanisms of Toxicity Gordon Research Conference

The the 2002 Mechanisms of Toxicity Gordon Research Conference is being held Sunday, July 21-Friday, July 26, 2002 at Bates College, Lewiston, Maine.
Over the past several years, this meeting has evolved into the premier small meeting focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying toxicant response.
This year’s program continues this tradition with sessions on: Applications of Genomics and Proteomics to Toxicology; Redox-Regulated Transcriptional Control; Receptor-Mediated Toxicity; Molecular Mechanisms of Developmental Toxicity; Genetic Susceptibility to Toxicants, and others. In addition, there will be a keynote address by Dr. Bruce Hammock and Late Breaking Research Presentations chosen from submitted poster abstracts. Complete program information and registration information can be obtained at: http://www.grc.uri.edu/

As Chair of this year’s conference, I would urge you to consider attending this meeting. The format has been developed to provide lively discussion and many opportunities for participants to interact on an informal basis.

Looking forward to seeing you this summer in Maine!

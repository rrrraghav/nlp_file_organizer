Subject: Hammer Thoughts

Harold-wanted to check in with you on what you thought of your Hammer experience this week. Derrick seemed to think you got a lot out of it.

I would love to pick your brain on how you see us being able to bring some of the process thinking here. I know there has been some hesitancy on Dave’s part to bring Hammer in to talk at senior team level-what do you think about at the DBT level or the next level down??

I hope we can find some time to discuss.

Look forward to hearing back from you-Dan

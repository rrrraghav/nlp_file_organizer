Laura,

The following are all the issues that need to be addressed to process the Virginia Slims FSI UPC request:

1. The FSI should not be OCR Coded

2. All markets need to be listed in the audience column on the request form.

3. All corresponding market codes need to be listed in the Market Code column on the request form.

4. The circulation and redemption need to be broken out by market on the request form.

After this has been done Alina needs to fax a signed copy to Nancy Fortes for processing.

Thanks for your help in clearing up this issue.
Andy

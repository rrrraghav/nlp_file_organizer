Dear Joy,

The week of September 30th is the only time when I probably couldn’t be available. Otherwise I am at your disposal.

Thanks a lot for the kind assistance.

Best regards,
Kostya

Dear Kostya,

In preparation for your trip to Richmond, are there any additional avoid dates of which I should be aware?

Best regards,
Joy

Joy,

Apart from the week of September 30th - October 3rd I am not aware of any particular avoid dates. It would, however, be a good idea to check with him directly.

Thanks,
Ruth

Thomas, per our conversation (and my voicemail to Brendan) attached are proposed message points for Tim Cindric,
President of Penske Racing to use in a CART press conference in California tomorrow morning to confirm that Marlboro
Team Penske will participate in the Indianapolis 500 event in 2001. Jack Rogers has indicated that Ellen Grant/Corporate
Affairs must approve these points before we forward them to him.
Could you please review with Ellen and send your approval comments to Jack Rogers before 10:30 a.m. Eastern
Standard Time? Jack’s extension is 3-2315. Sorry for the tight deadline, I appreciate your help. Shaunn D’Alessandro

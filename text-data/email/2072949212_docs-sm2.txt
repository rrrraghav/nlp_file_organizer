Bob,

Enclosed please find a list of high potential stores for the Parliament Lights and Menthol
Lights Kings Box launch.

The stores are currently sorted by territory number, followed by Parliament Kings Box
share. All stores on the list have High Potential Indices (>140). A high potential index
indicates that the demographics of the store mirror Parliamentary typical consumer. The stores
on this list comprise nearly 74% of the total in 4LO and should enable us to achieve our 63%
kings box distribution goal.

The menthol SDI (far right column) has been included to help TSMs balance menthol versus
blue POS in the store.

You will need to divide the list up by territory number in order to provide the appropriate
stores to each TSM. Please distribute this list as soon as possible to aid in the sell-in of
Parliament and let us know how useful it is.

Any questions, please feel free to call.

Thanks,
Kim (212-878-2643)

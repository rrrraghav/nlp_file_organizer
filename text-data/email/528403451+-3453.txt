—IMPORTANT REQUEST—

As previously communicated, changes have been made in the Merchandising Tables to capture the Pack and Carton account conditions important to measuring the success of our 1996 Retail Partners Marketing Plan implementation.

Your immediate assistance is requested to accurately update these indicators by February 16, 1996.

In order to simplify, insure consistency, and request only the most critical information the following measures have been taken:

Reduction of Indicators

Effective January 29, 1996 the Merchandising Tables will be modified and the process will be started to clean out all old Table entries. The previous set of indicators will be removed as you receive a full download on your laptop, Pqget or Norand appropriate.

The current merchandising entries are listed below. These “9” entries will reside under the subheading "RJR Pack" for ease of entering.

The indicators are to be used to capture conditions in both Pack and Carton Outlets. Please note some indicators are directed toward Pack Outlets while others apply to both Carton and Pack accounts.

Package Accounts Package and Carton Accounts
1 RJR FPD Party PM Exclusive
1 RJR FPD Disadv. PM Masters
2 RJR FP Display BW Premium Plus
RJR Non Pd Display Lor Prm Disp
RJR Non Pd SD

Definitions of each indicator are listed below:

1. RJR FPD Party - Represents an account where RJR has (1) Full Price Display on location and is at least at Parity with competition.

Example: RJR - 1 Full Price Display / 1 Savings Display
PM- No Presence
BW - 1 Display
Report: 1 RJR FPD Party

Example: RJR - 1 Full Price Display / 1 Savings Display
PM- 1 Full Price Display / 1 Savings Display
Report: 1 RJR FPD Party

In this case - PM has accepted 1 Full Price Display and RJR is at Parity regardless of the contract payment level.

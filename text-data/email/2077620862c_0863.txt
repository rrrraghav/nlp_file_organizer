Subject: RE: Model Plant Cities Highlight Report

(We forgot to include B&G of NC under strategic partnerships (that’s a biggie!), and I would add Right Choices conference in VA under community action. TH; anything else? KC, pls add and I'll forward to CJL and EM.)

Truly excellent (jb everybody! Hard to believe it has only been one year since we had this focus and had our first couple of meetings about RIC and CAB. As a team we have done tremendous work.

And, thank you KC for keeping the ball rolling on coordination, reporting and follow-up!

CR: You should know that we will be selecting new and different model communities (non plant communities) in the next couple of weeks while we will be doing things this more and more in 2000.

As we move into these other markets with our strategic focus areas and grass roots work; the model plant community project will enter a new phase that will focus on site-specific resources. As KC mentions below: this includes a) working with FSF on ysp, b) developing employee volunteerism programs, mentor and parent programs, c) more internal communications on ysp and d) begin supplier/business partner involvement in ysp.

We can talk more about these four items on next call or meeting. But, before we start on the new, take some time to reflect on all the accomplishments last year. It’s quite impressive.

Once again, great work by all! You guys make tough work a whole lot easier and a whole lot of fun.

Happy New Year and Happy New Millenium!

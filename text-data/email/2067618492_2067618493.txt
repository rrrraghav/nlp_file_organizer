No, don't do that... it’s all in it.

Below is the contact information for Greg Connolly, Bill Rickert and Murray Kaiserman. By copy of this note, I am asking Ken Podraza to determine who he feels is best positioned to contact these individuals to let them know that the Australian Ministry of Health may contact them to discuss benchmarking issues. Ken: Will you please let Laurie know when that has been done so she can release this information to PM Australia? Thanks. I’m also providing (further below) a list of public health authorities who have been present at meetings with Connolly when benchmarking issues have been discussed. Let me know if you need anything further. Claire

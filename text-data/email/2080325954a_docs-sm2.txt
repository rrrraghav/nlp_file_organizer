Hi thought I'd give my 2 cents on the new sign holder. This is my (thought and only mine) before putting this
in front of the rest...
* good concept and like the flexibility of sizing changes. Could we design the Slide BY to do the same -
offer area w/ spin it’s and we only provide an insert for the graphics? I realize there could be issues w/
product deal communication but maybe we can find a creative way to address this.
* I'm concerned about adding more signage. Though the sign is small, it’s functionally more flexible
than the slide-by. Will we add to the fixture signage (4x > 5) if you include slides by? More importantly,
will accounts opt to remove slide-bys in favor of smaller signs and thereby, we have less graphic
capabilities? Just a thought to consider or maybe you can provide
reviewed this naming/size document and feel that you can provide the necessary input... but I'll also give
you my 2 cents.
My thought is consistency in naming is a good thing for systems and communication input. Just keep
your marketing hat on for sizing so we don’t get boxed in. A possibility is max / min total sq inches and
thus, we can work within those shapes within the total retail estate. (i.e. The Parliament and Midas
arrow was effective - minimal sq inches and yet communicated a lot). I think this will also give the
agency some more flexibility since frankly, sometimes are creative is forced to fit and I prefer the
number sizes to insure consistency and insure we have the right sizes appropriate for the piece (maybe
smaller, maybe the same).
That’s all folks. I'm sure you'll take it in the right direction.

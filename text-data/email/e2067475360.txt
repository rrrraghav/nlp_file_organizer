Mike - Your group is certainly in the loop. We need to discuss having your folks run the metals analysis of the UJI under the exaggerated conditions as well as the GC/MS fingerprinting of particulate and gas from the UJI. As an alternate we could use the whole core, puff by puff analysis. I’m not familiar with the puff to puff work but if you think it will provide more information we are interested. Bill Gardner did the previous GC/MS Fingerprinting working to determine the semi-quantitative differences between the CaCO3 and MgCO3 smokes in the EHCS. Possibly Bill could compare the differences in the two phases with puffing conditions. Give me a call.

Best regards,
Robbie Elves

Everyone - Bill Rickert at Labstat sent this to me with regard to their experience and ability to perform all puff profile on their machines. FYI with regard to our efforts on the "JLI-TOPOGRAPHY" Study.

Best regards,
Robbie Elves

Robbie - based on the response from Pete (see attached) we should be able to work within the range of parameters.

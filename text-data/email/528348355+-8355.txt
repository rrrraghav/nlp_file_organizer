Subject: Peer and Parental Influence On Youth Smoking

Attachments:
PEERPRES.DOC

Greetings,

Attached is an updated list of articles which I have found relating to the subject topic and reinforce the notion that peer and parental influence are significant factors in youth smoking onset.

I have added about 5 additional references from the last list.

Lyle

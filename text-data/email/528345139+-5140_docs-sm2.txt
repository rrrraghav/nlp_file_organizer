Weekly Report ending June 7.

This week I drafted letters for those activists in Iowa who committed to write letters on
the FDA. As you may recall we had 15 people agree to do this. As always, people
promise and then sit on the letter for days on end so I had to do quite a bit of follow-up.

Thus far we have copies of letters from the following people:

David Payer - former candidate for legislature and small business owner
Jim Raife - health food store owner
Jin Kuhlman - health care professional
Todd Rector - Auditor
Mary Rector - Arthritis sufferer
Michael Bennett - former candidate for legislature and real estate agent

The subjects of the letters covered a broad range. They included Mary Rector’s inability
to purchase DMSO, the FDA's attempt to regulate tobacco, the FDA’s policing of medical
devices, the regulation of the health food industry, the regulation of vitamins and drug
approval. I tried to vary the topics as much as possible.

Letters to the editor were also sent to the DesMoines Register covering the same topics. I
expect to have copies of the remaining letters back to me by the end of the week. I’m
faxing you copies of the letters I do have now. I plan to do the same thing for Illinois next

week.
Anti-activist Jesse Brown will be in KC tomorrow through Saturday as part of a program
sponsored by the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study, a tobacco-control

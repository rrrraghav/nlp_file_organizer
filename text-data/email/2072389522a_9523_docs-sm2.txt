Subject: RE: MI: Mike Barnes, Tricom Pictures...

Hmmm ... why doesn't he 1) go to a library; 2) call the Tobacco Institute in Washington for more complete, industry information? I do not see how sending him PM corporate information helps his objective …

So. I called Barnes and he says he is a researcher for educational half hour shows; this one is on cigarettes, specifically Philip Morris in this case. Hence, his questions…Tricom Picture produces different kinds of shows, e.g. Better Parenting; Travelers Guide; Strategic Business Report … Largely consumer driven, half hour educational "stuff", which they sell to the networks.

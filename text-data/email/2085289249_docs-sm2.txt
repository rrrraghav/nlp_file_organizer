Judy,

Joe Bickett will be presenting the attached updates on the revision to the OS Standard at Friday 6/29’s OBT meeting. I just wanted to give you a heads-up so that you can prepare. Will you please review at your earliest convenience and get your comments back to Joe Bickett? (I will be on vacation for the next two weeks, but I would appreciate a copy of your comments before I leave - it will be after the fact.)
Thanks so much for your help!

We’ve been invited to attend the Section Sales Meetings in San Antonio and Philadelphia (and I'm sure Trey would welcome us to his section meeting as well). Although the agenda is a repeat of the sales meeting and filled with a lot of technical stuff, there are 30 minutes devoted to YSP on the last day of the 2 1/2 day meeting starting 8:30 in the morning (see enclosed). Further, it would be an opportunity for us to meet with the entire section, including TSMS – the front line of much of our local efforts.

Mike Rudnick’s meeting will be held in San Antonio next week T-Th. One wouldn't have to arrive until late afternoon on Wed, in time to catch the last session and have the benefit of having dinner with the group.

Trey Clem’s meeting will be held 9/19-20 just outside of Pittsburgh. Unfortunately I will not be able to make it as I need to be in NY the morning and evening of the 20th but Annemarie can attend.

Jim Bischoff's meeting will be held in Baltimore 9/25-27. If Eric can’t make it, Annemarie can (and got a personal invitation from Jim) as can I.
Thoughts?

Sorry for the confusion. Just tried to reach you and you are not in. Can you meet Friday @ 11:30 to discuss/finalize plan?

In the meantime, don't worry, I will pay for the production of the 1,000,000 booklets. I might even be able to afford part of the postage depending on the costs. FYI - Karen Chaikin sent the brochure weight to you as well as Jon Robert last week to help you determine costs. Hope this helps

Looking forward to our meeting to get everything finalized. This is a great opportunity for us to integrate our efforts.

Kevin:

In addition to the previous request from Joel for information on acceptable ways to store identification information (attached), we also need to tell our supplier there are states where our new
test procedure service used to collect sensory data. To reiterate this procedure, we pre-screen and collect demographic information, then conduct a brief interview with the candidate and if approved, collect data over the phone. We need this information before our supplier can begin selection of facilities for
our project. Please let me know if there is anyone else who I need to contact for this information.

Thanks

Melissa

Attached is Joel’s previous request

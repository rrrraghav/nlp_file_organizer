Cambridge, MA -- Although the health department wants to pursue a complete ban on smoking, they’re apparently willing to listen to arguments from restaurant owners and allowing some exceptions. Also, at least three city council members (two plus the mayor) have agreed to rescind the city's ordinances on smoking to make way for whatever the health department decides. Two councillors are undecided. The other four are against allowing the health department enact a smoking ban. The public health commissioner feels an agreement will be reached between the restaurants and the health department. However, no matter what that agreement is this time, he thinks the town will ban smoking in restaurants and bars in the near future. To help defeat the self-service display proposal also before the board, Bob Stone requests a mailing to retailers to encourage written comments to the city council and the board.

Solano County, Calif. -- On 8/4, the supervisors will consider a plan to ban smoking outside the entrances of county buildings.

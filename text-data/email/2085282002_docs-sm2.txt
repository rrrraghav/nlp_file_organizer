RE:

Susan,

In response to your e-mail comments, I do not know any process that currently exists on PR, Guam or other US territories.
I have been requesting guidance on resources and how these are to be handled. I have gotten the information on what
their needs are, but no one knows who should be handling them and what processes should be followed. I am
not aware of who should be handling or processes. Thanks.

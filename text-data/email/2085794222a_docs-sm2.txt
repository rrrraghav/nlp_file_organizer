Cc: Subject: Supersilms US patent case - its over

I’m pleased to report that the B&W patent infringement suit re Virginia Slims Supersilms film, finally over in the US. PM USA has won.

In particular, last fall PM USA was successful at the Federal Circuit in arguing that the relevant claims of B&W's US Reissue Patent 32,615 re a cigarette w/ a reduced circumference were invalid, which upheld a '99 ruling to the same effect by federal district court in Richmond. The time for B&W’s last recourse, a petition to the Supreme Court, without any filing by them.

Re specifically, this clears the way for future PM USA production of Supersilms for export assuming no relevant BAT patents in the particular countries of destination. We are currently working with our counsel in Japan to see if there are other BAT patents in addition to the BAT Japanese patent successfully invalidated by JT with PM assistance and will report the results when available in 3-6 weeks. Of course, our proposed global resolution to BAT in response to their offer to settle this issue would resolve this question on a worldwide basis.

Special recognition needs to be made of Jim Scharft, who handled this entire matter for many years with great skill, patience, and foresight.

We’ll keep you posted. Pls. let me know if you have any questions. thanks

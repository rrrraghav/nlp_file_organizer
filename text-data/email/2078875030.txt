He is doing a news story on the recent overturning/striking down of a smoking
ban in Princeton, New Jersey. It will be a short taped interview to be aired
every half hour tonight and maybe tomorrow morning.

In a nut shell, he would like our thoughts/a comment from PM about the judge
striking down the smoking ban.

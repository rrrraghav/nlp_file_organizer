Dear Gerry:

For the above cited project, I need a testing request including more information about the difference between the 2
HYDRA cigarettes and about the F-lighter, and name of the requester.

The determination of o-nizidine, dibenz(a,h)acridine, dibenz(a,e)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)pyrene, dibenz(a,i)pyrene,
and dibenz(b,f)pyrene are foreseen in this study. In addition, we need to quantify
the individual isomers benzo(a)fluoranthene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrenes, and dibenz(a,h)
anthracene with our new PAH method. This change should also be included in our current smoke chemistry list.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Regina

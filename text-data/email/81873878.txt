Subject: Re your voicemail

Bart –

I received your voicemail of last week and wanted to point you in the right direction. All media and sponsorship proposals regarding our Youth Smoking Prevention Program here at Lonillard need to begin with Anthony Arena, our media planner, at Bozell New York at 212-727-5302. Please call him directly.

Thank you for your interest.

P.S. I attempted to return your call this afternoon, and it appears someone picked up the phone and then hung up.

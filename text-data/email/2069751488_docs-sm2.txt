Dear Matthias, Pete,

Attached please find the first draft of the above document by the HKTI. I have a number of issues with it in its present form as I am not sure the comments from Matthias, Gary and myself are fully factored in. To speed up the review process, I am sending you the document for review while I work on it myself. If we cannot get a satisfactory consensus with the HKTI, we may have to make our own submission separate from them. Jenny Fung has asked me to turn the piece around as soon as possible so I am afraid it’s the same mad rush story again.

Thanks to you both for your input. Dick, the information on Labstat is excellent and I have included the data as a Table.

Are you all OK with the use of the words "flavorant" and "processing aids"? What about formulation aids?

Enclosed is the next draft.

Two portions are highlighted, both of which could be removed. Regarding the second portion (talking about rate of absorption), this comes from our answer to Markey, with reference, plus a direct response to the Parkow claims.
Regarding the first section, I think it's important that the audience receiving this is sophisticated enough to understand the issues. Certainly, we do not want to provide a complex answer which confuses folks, when a simply one would work.

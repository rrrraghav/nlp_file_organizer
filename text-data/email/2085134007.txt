Kim,

Please book a conference room for this meeting. I don’t yet know how many guests will accompany Dr. Gallagher but for now, assume another 3.

I would really like to have conf room 4A or B so please book a room now. I will confirm numbers when I know and at that time, will ask you to order refreshments.

thanks.

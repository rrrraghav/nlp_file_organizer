Maura --

Here's a short section I put together from two documents: a consumer letter that lauco was going to pass by Andy last week; and a risk-reduction document that was approved six months ago by R&D management and by Andy, Chuck and Mike Johnson, but has not received final blessing for distribution from Chuck or Mike.

If you think this works, I think that Tommy and Chuck and Rucker need to approve and that Tommy and/or Chuck needs to determine if Andy needs to approve.

If Andy needs to approve, that needs to happen today.

Jim:

I think you should review the Pay register during the time frames noted by Anne for any OOS deletion with 2 styles noted. Then request an over ride request through me, attaching this e-mail as documentation.

Should you have any questions, please contact me.

Sincerely,
Steve

Jim and Jim - We were informed today when our order was called in that Salem FF side box would be back ordered until 5/29. This is an item on our non-compliance list - please tell me how this will be handled if a store is found non-compliant for having this as one of the items. You must remember that failure to have this item in stock will result in a store call. That means a store could be out of stock for two weeks before them can reorder.

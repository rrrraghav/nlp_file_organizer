Media Outlet-Editorial Humor

This guy is the managing editor for a publication in Brookline, MA where there is a severe
smoking ban. He feels strongly about it and has been very vocal supporting the restaurants with editorials and now would like to devote a 1/4 page ad. They
want to run an ad that will be humorous and they’ve gotten our smoking issues brochure and would like permission to reprint the courtesy ad.
They feel it says everything that needs to be said. They need to hear from us by 4:30 ish.

Ellen: Any problem with this?

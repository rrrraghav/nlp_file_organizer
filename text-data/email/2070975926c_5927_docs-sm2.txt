I had a long conversation with Mary JO. I’m fine with the follow up to the specific incident & the handling of the corporate contribution.

However -- I'm really concerned (&very cynical) about what might be happening. I suspect this was not by coincidence. I’m not sure how much it was preplanned -- but Mary Jo can share with several different scenarios that we brainstormed.
Mary Jo promised to keep on alert for any unusual activity in the current 3 markets -- and is going to think about whether there are any preventative steps we can/should take.

Eric:

Excuse delay, I have some answers for you.

1. Chapters are planned for San Antonio and Philadelphia. Chapter operating in Columbus Ohio.

2. First Tee wants you to speak with Len Stachfis about the sponsorship. His telephone number is: 904-940-4305.

3. The grants that First Tee awards to chapters vary between $20,000 and $100,000 based on development criteria. I am not aware of the specifics but can get those from HQ if you need the info. National also helps chapters with fundraising activities and Len can be specific on that issue

4. I don't recall Fred’s comment regarding the PGA. I am following that one. I will let you know the specifics.

First Tee states that the packets have been mailed to you and Charles. Have a great weekend.

Herb--

we have confirmed our research schedule for assessing the appropriateness of U.S. materials for Canada. We would be delighted to have you attend the groups if your schedule allows. We will be receiving the draft discussion guides tomorrow. Are you interested in reviewing them?? The groups have been designed to provide us with major market vs. perimeter vs. rural perceptions. Guelph is "rural", and Mississauga is “perimeter”. Toronto (core) tends to be more jaded than outlying areas, so we do not want to rely solely on Toronto perceptions in developing the Canadian program.

Schedule:

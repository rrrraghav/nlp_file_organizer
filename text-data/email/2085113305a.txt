Hi Carolynn-

Just wanted to share the revised, laid-out employee suggestion form w/ you, along with the promotional flyer that will
be distributed at the plant communities (for those who don’t have access to the intranet) encouraging employees
to submit their ideas. We've been asked to review process so the content is not new, just
the design (which we placed on approved YSP letterhead).

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks-

Eric Osterm
Manager, Youth Smoking Prevention Programs

Subject: RE: Spec consolidation
I’m scheduled for the OBT presentation on 6/16th.
Please help me by doing the following:

•	Is the RFP still in the picture? If the answer is yes, then I need to know that, if the answer is partial RFP then I need to know that too. - In this breadth, how do you propose for us to split our numbers with or without RFP?
•	Please take my original numbers and do the ROI analysis with and without RFP, i.e., please take the expense portion out, but still reflect expense portion as a separate line item.

I appreciate your help.

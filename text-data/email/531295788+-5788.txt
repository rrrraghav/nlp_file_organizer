A task force co-sponsored by Lynn Beasley and Jim Maguire has been created to respond to concerns over the growing levels of fraud and waste associated with discounting as well as the ineffectiveness of many of our current discounting promotions. There is also a growing awareness of the increased demands that are being put on the sales organization to spend time auditing stores to combat this fraud and waste.

As part of this task force, we are attempting to understand how widespread these problems are and to try to develop some creative ways to address fraud waste and discounting ineffectiveness that will free up the time of the sales organization to focus again on core selling accountabilities that are at the heart of your job responsibilities.

One objective of the task force is to understand how sales force time is currently being utilized. As part of this effort, we are interviewing and surveying people throughout the sales organization to understand how the time of the sales force is spent today. You have been selected to participate in the phone interview portion of this survey. The questions you will be asked are attached so that you can review them and formulate your responses. The questions should be answered based on your own assigned accounts, do not include accounts out of territory coverage.

You will be contacted in the next few days to set up a convenient time for the interview between Monday June 28 and Wednesday June 30. It should take no longer than 20 minutes. Thank you in advance for your help.

Subject: RE: Copy of CA home site updates and doc

While reviewing the attached documents, I received a phone call from Tiffany Wallace who is in the Ohio State Government Affairs office. Both she and her management felt the need for a website identifying who they are, the regions they serve, etc. She was charged with developing this website and completed it for the Ohio office. However, she ran into a problem when she shared the URL with Scott Fisher. She called the Helpdesk and was advised that for it to work correctly, she would have to setup a peer to peer connection.

It has been a few months since we met with the department reps for the CA intranet site to give them an update on the progress of the CA Intranet Site development. We should probably do this soon, as departments who do not have representation, such as FGA/SGA from designing sites that we may not be able to use in the future.

Who is the appropriate person to represent the FGA/SGA?

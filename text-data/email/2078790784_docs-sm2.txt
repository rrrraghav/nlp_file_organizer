I understand where you’re coming from, but don't spend a lot of time on it

we’re in a start-up mode and as such, we can expect to be understaffed

over time, when our long term strategy and needs are clarified AND when we have solved our internal performance issues,
I believe we can justify and most likely get more headcount

the answer, as I have said to you many times is not for you to kill yourself… the answer is to do the highest priority tasks
and do them efficiently and well

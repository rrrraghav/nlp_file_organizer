Dear Ray:

This is the Winston’s 21st year of NHRA Drag Racing sponsorship. And with our Winston Select 10 driver's points program debut, we’re all expecting an exciting race season. This program adds momentum to the company’s overall objective of increasing trial and awareness of Winston Select by supporting our smoker conversion program and increasing Select signage. It also helps to strengthen the commitment of drivers and teams as they help us remind smokers that Winston brings the sport of drag racing to them.

This year's Sports Marketing team consists of the following personnel:

Rick Hauser, Senior Manager (910) 741-6486
Bryan Pierce, Assistant Manager (910) 741-4834
Sara Ayers, Assistant Manager (910) 741-2842
Deb Brittsan, Miss Winston

We all will be staying at the Hilton in East Brunswick if you need to contact us during race week (908) 828-2000.

On behalf of the Winston Drag Racing Team, I am providing the following information to assist you with your event planning for the upcoming Mopar Parts Nationals at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park, May 19-21.

The Mobile Activity Unit (MAU) will again be in Englishtown. This exhibit is designed to interact with consumers much the same way as the Winston Pavilion did in the past. Components of the MAU include a Winston Motorsports simulator, large message board, competitive pack exchange booths, and interactive race games. The MAU will not include a premium store this year. If you have any questions regarding the MAU, please call Michael Wright (910) 741-2895 or Steve Tucker (910) 741-6673.

In addition to the MAU, a hospitality area exclusively for fans who are RJRT smokers, will be featured adjacent to the MAU area. This area shows our support to our franchise and newly converted smokers. SME provides refreshments to them and also opportunities to receive driver’s autographs

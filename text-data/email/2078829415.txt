Every so often people concerned about tobacco and health need a reminder that the USA is a multicultural society. Several years ago I heard Larry Murillo discuss avoiding offending aboriginal people by talking about “Native American” instead of “Indian.” The University of New Mexico’s Native Tobacco
Seed Bank and Education Program (NTSBEP) at the University of New Mexico (UNM) –
http://www.unm.edu/~nativetobacco/ - please do to visit any number of other sites involving
NA Health & Tobacco Use. “All tobacco is an extremely powerful, sacred and dangerous substance. When
used properly and with respect, in small amounts in traditional American Indian ceremonies, tobacco is
a positive source of power. When misused, especially in the form of cigarettes, snuff, cigars and other
commercial products, tobacco is a deadly killer.”

The incensed correspondent may not agree with the above statement, but isn’t it imperialistic for some of us
to try to dictate someone else's heritage (including tobacco farmers?) At least in VA some of the public
health community have tried to communicate with growers regarding finding a solution that incorporates
multiple parties.

If anyone wants to flame me for saying this (as was done earlier regarding my own tobacco use), I would
appreciate you sending the e-mail to me directly at ferguson@unm.net. Thank you.

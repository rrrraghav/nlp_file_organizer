Dear Loreen:

Here is a list of accomplishments from INBIF/CRC:

    Guidance-related:
        Identification of further targets) for reduction in vitro cytotoxicity assay with validation in in vivo lung inflammation assay (hydroquinone)
        Identification of the particulate matter as sole contributor to in vivo rat lung inflammation, no effect by smoke from a non-cellulose cigarette
        Establishment of an in vitro rapid stress signalling screening assay (based on heme oxygenase 1 induction)
    Evaluation-related:
        Mouse model for lung tumorigenesis (A/J mouse) reproduced (with ETS surrogate) mechanically
        CVD-related inhalation study in collaboration with external experts
        EHCS-related lung inflammation in rats one third of that of conventional cigarettes (on equal TPM dose)
        PM scientific symposium on carbon monoxide and cancer
    Capability enhancement:
        New CRC facility ready to move in.
        Update of GLP compliance for CRC and INBIF/O
        AAALAC accreditation for CRC
        New Cardiovascular Research laboratory at INBIF/O
        Developing new technologies successfully initialized (transcriptomics, proteomics, non-invasive imaging)
        In vivo rapid screening assay initialized
    Basic research-related:
        New insights into changes in cellular development (apoptosis/necrosis) by cigarette smoke and individual constituents and fractions

Apart from that we of course have also worked on many aspects of SOAR and EHCS, which are not part of the WSA projects.

Please do not hesitate to come back to me if you need further information.

Best regards,
Hans-Juergen

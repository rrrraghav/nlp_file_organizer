Subject: L&M Comparisons

Norma,

As I told you this AM, the L&M delivery comparisons are as follows:

* US Sourced Puerto Rico L&M KS - 13 mg Tar (Current Design, Production date TBD)
* US Produced USA Domestic L&M KS - 15 mg (Current Design, Production scheduled for 5/12)
* Both use same materials of construction and blendflavor systems.

I have reviewed this comparison with Marc Chema (Director, Intl Design Function) and Urs Nyffeler.

With the Puerto Rico design, we are matching a current Guatemala design @ 13 mg and want the newly sourced product to be sensorially transparent.

For the USA Domestic design, we are flexible and can use a 13 mg KS design, since:

* from the NPC our only marching order was "Keep It Simple"
* Liggett KS product measures about 12.5-13.5mg Tar
* we could consolidate the two designs to one - Operations efficiencies

Our Design Team is assessing the logistics of putting the new Domestic design change into play.

If all OK, should we proceed with the 13 mg design - or do you still want the spreadsheet of current designs (for Legal Review) as we discussed?

Thanks,

Ken Newman

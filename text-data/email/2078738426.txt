Subject: FW: Comments on WRA / JT agenda

Mark has aptly characterized those comments of mine that belong in an "outside the department communication" from those internal to the department. The latter could go into your cover to Denise and/or remain as issues to be cognizant of for further discussion. Indeed, my parenthetical observations were just that and were offered more as points of concern than for further dissemination.

Subject: PMI/PMUSA R&D Agreement

We are working on the new PMI/PMUSA R&D agreement. I need to get a list of activities and people in PDT
that do work only for PM USA, or only for PMI. Right now I can’t think of anybody for PMI except Jeanette
Hollis and myself. And possibly some people in the old DMP group who are working for PMUSA
only. Everyone else should be in the general R&D category that gets allocated between PMI and PMUSA.
However, if I missed anything please let me know. I need this by the end of this week.

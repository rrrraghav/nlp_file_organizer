Both NBC and The Washington Post are covering the BAT document, tonight for the former and tomorrow morning for the latter.

David Reames commented on the record with the following:

Because of attorney client privilege, I can’t comment on document purporting to describe meeting with client. However, it is not unusual or improper for lawyers to help clients identify experts, including scientific experts, on matters of potential regulatory, legislative or litigation significance or to work with experts.

Kor is focusing on the "controversy" phrase and David thinks he will say this doc was in response to industry on the ropes, a desperate move. Bob told David that he would like to get his hands on CRS report which I am trying to do.

David believes Washington Post is trying to be balanced. Reporter read back to him comment from “industry lawyer” re: EMS is controversial and reporter apparently is including a box that goes into CRS report.

Cheryl,

Thanks for giving me a copy of youre memo on a procedure for sample inventory control. I don't know if your thoughts will have been influenced by your trip to Lancaster Labs by the time you get this email. Your plan definitely cuts through the clutter on finding samples from the current season. One question I have is how will we handle future sample consolidation. That is, as a few seasons pass, we may want to consolidate a limited number of samples from the past - for example, high TSNA samples resulting from a special curing program-into a new location. Would we then need to prepare a new sample label with a new location code?

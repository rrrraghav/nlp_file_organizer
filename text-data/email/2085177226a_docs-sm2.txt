Please coordinate this training session with Bill Lynch - and the individuals listed in the e-mail below. Thanks.



Dear All,

As you know, we are implementing a new system for tracking employee time and attendance. This system will replace our current manual process and is expected to improve accuracy and efficiency.

To ensure a smooth transition, we will be holding training sessions for all employees who will be using the new system. These sessions will cover the basic functionality of the system, as well as best practices for data entry and reporting.

The training schedule is as follows:

Group 1: Monday, September 3, 2001, 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM, Conference Room A
Group 2: Tuesday, September 4, 2001, 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM, Conference Room B
Group 3: Wednesday, September 5, 2001, 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM, Conference Room C

Please sign up for a session that is convenient for you. If none of the listed times work, please contact Human Resources to arrange an alternative time.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Bill Lynch
Human Resources

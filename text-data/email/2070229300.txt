DIANE,

IN RESPONSE TO YOUR INQUIRY ABOUT ADVERTISING EXPERTS’ INTERACTION WITH THE LA METRO GROUP AND ITS PUBLISHER, MR. HAMM, THE FOLLOWING OUTLINES EVENTS LEADING UP TO MR. HAMM'S LETTER TO MR. CAMPBELL LAST MONTH (CORRESPONDENCE WAS NOT DATED):

BACKGROUND --

IN MAY, 1990 ADVERTISING EXPERTI BECAME OUR AGENCY OF RECORD FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADVERTISING. MR. HAMM’S PUBLICATIONS, ALONG WITH ALL OTHER PUBLICATIONS ON OUR SCHEDULE WERE REVIEWED BY THE AGENCY.

ADVERTISING EXPERTI REQUESTED BACK ISSUES OF THE LA METRO GROUP'S NEWSPAPERS BOTH IN WRITING AND VERBALLY. THE REQUEST WAS MET WITH RESISTANCE AND WAS NEVER FULFILLED. AS A RESULT OF THE NEWSPAPER’S NON-COMPLIANCE, THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE PM USA LIST.

ADVERTISING EXPERTI HAS CONTINUED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE LA METRO GROUP AND ASSURED THE PUBLISHER THAT THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR ADVERTISING AS SOON AS ISSUES ARE FORWARDED ON A REGULAR BASIS.

ADVERTISING EXPERTI'S RECOMMENDATION --

THE AGENCY RECOMMENDS THAT PM USA REFRAIN FROM ADVERTISING WITH THE LA METRO GROUP. THE PUBLICATION APPEARS TO BE UNSTABLE AS A RESULT OF INCONSISTENT PUBLISHING PRACTICES, E.G., ONLY WHEN THE NEWSPAPER OBTAINS FINANCIAL BACKING IN THE WAY OF ADVERTISING.

ADDITIONALLY, ADVERTISING EXPERTI HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT MR. HAMM'S QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS BACKGROUND.

NEXT STEPS --

GARRISON JACKSON WILL ATTEND THE NPPA CONVENTION IN MINNEAPOLIS NEXT WEEK AND IS PREPARED TO DISCUSS PM USA BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS WITH MR. HAMM IF MR. HAMM IS IN ATTENDANCE.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THANK YOU.

Subject: GCB speech at Kraft, late Jan

Hi Bob
Glad you’re in and WORKING HARD :

Like I said on the phone, Peter is out of the office & he's asked me to do a bit of research in his absence, re: a speech he's preparing for GCB to be delivered at Kraft later this month.

He’s specifically interested in discussing how the value of investment in PM has grown (source: maybe the last shareholders report) ... CAN YOU VERIFY that the stock price has more than tripled in the 1990s? ... AND, is there any documentation showing how much the value of investment in PM has grown (eg. in The New York Times this week, there was an article talking about the Dow Jones stocks, how much certain ones are worth now based on investment in them a few years ago).

Peter will be back in on Mon but anything you can help me with today would be much appreciated. Just email the info // Thx!

Levin’s story ran on Monday. He left me a voice mail on Monday afternoon so he may have another story in the works. If you think it's best to continue to blow off his calls, I will. If not, I can return his call and let him know that we don’t discuss any focus group testing that we may or may not be doing. What do you think?

DEAR MR. BENTSEN:

IT'S BECOME AN ELABORATE GAME OF "HIDE AND SEEK."

FIRST, CONGRESS TRIES TO HIDE ROBS TAX INCREASES BEHIND ECONOMIC JARGON LIKE “EXCISE” AND “SURTAX.” THEN, CONGRESS SEEKS TO GET AWAY WITH IT – BY CLAIMING THE INCREASE IS TEMPORARY.

I WRITE BECAUSE THE MEN CONGRESS IS ALREADY QUIETLY -- BUT EFFECTIVELY -- ROBBING ARE THOSE WHO WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR THE OUTCOME -- AND A RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE, WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

SOME QUICK BACKGROUND:

LAST YEAR, CONGRESS REVEGED ON ITS PROMISE TO “SUNSET” ECONOMIC JARGON FOR TERM – A TEMPORARY 30% INCREASE IN TELEPHONE EXCISE TAXES. THE ORIGINAL SUNSET DATE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 1988.

THIS YEAR, CONGRESS HAS FOUND A NEW TARGET: THE TOBACCO PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. BY 1982 FEDERAL LAW, TEMPORARY SURTAX ON TOBACCO TAKES ONE DUE TO SUNSET AND STABILIZE AT 16-CENT PER PACK.

BUT CONGRESS, ENCOURAGED BY ITS SUCCESSFUL TRIPLING OF PHONE EXCISE TAXES, IS SEEKING TO DO IT AGAIN. THE PLAN: TO QUIETLY DOUBLE, TRIPLE -- POSSIBLY QUADRUPLE -- THE CURRENT TOBACCO SURTAX ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW.

I DON’T EXPECT YOU TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY. THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.

BUT WHO DO YOU THINK PLAYS BEST IN ITS GAME OF "HIDE AND SEEK"?
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE: YOU DO.

IF THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY BECKONS STANDARDS OPERATING PROCEDURE, THERE’S NO TELLING WHO WILL BE NEXT ON THE CONGRESSIONAL HIT LIST. AMONG TARGETS: NATURAL GAS? PETROLEUM? PAYING

Subject: Circle K “We Card” payment

Jonny,

After speaking with Elisa about Circle K, she asked me to follow up with you a few things.

1. We need to see a copy of the permission letter from the "we card" coalition to Circle K allowing them to create their own "we card" signage.
2. Are we currently supplying any “we card” signage to Circle K?
3. We would like to take a look at these newly created we card graphics.
4. We need to determine the average per store cost of our “we card” signage vs. the $4 Circle K is proposing.

Let me know if you need my help with any of this. Talk to you soon.

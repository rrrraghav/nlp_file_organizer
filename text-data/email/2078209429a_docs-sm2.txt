Joe-

Per our conversation regarding old wholesale account # 53710 ( Box Wholesale) being purchased by Discount Distributors, and the new KA# 59067 matching with new customer number.

The account has been ordering product from CS as usual, however they have been ordering under old# 53710. Richmond CS currently has #53710 as
Discount Distributors customer #. This is a huge problem for the account receiving credit for purchases when their Midas KA# is 59067.

I spoke with Bobby Sherrill Accts. Receivable Supervisor / Richmond CS, and they are currently receiving Discount Dist. #2 orders under #53710 ( sold to, ship to) and paying the bills is #39815 ( bill to, payer) Discount Distributors parent company.
We need an interface built in to get the exchange for credit of purchases from 53710 to 59067....

I am needing some direction to get this corrected in Richmond and ensure PM STARS is receiving the tapes with the correct KA#. purchases.

Help.....

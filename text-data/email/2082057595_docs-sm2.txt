FYI - to keep you guys in the loop...

The conference room in El is ours through the end of August. The badge reader will be activated at the close of business on Friday. There will be one generic badge for entering and exiting the room and my badge will also be recognized by the reader. Security has my name and numbers to the contact. There is one potential problem with August 20 - 23 (Norma Machech wants the room for "kids day") - she and I have already spoken on this issue and I have it on my ticker to follow up with her at the end of July as to whether or not she will need to move the “kids day activities” to another conference room.

We have a retiree (Ed Stultz) who is interested in covering the production and he is available for weekends and after hours. Jim McNabny and I are coordinating on having Ed Stultz brought in through the arrangement we have with H&W. (If there are any glitches in Ed’s availability, I plan to fill in on coverage.)

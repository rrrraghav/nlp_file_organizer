Subject: RF: The Village Voice

Chisu (pronounced Chisan) is staff writer at the Village Voice. However the
article she's writing is for "A" magazine, which is the largest selling magazine
catering to the Asian American population (ages 25-35).

She is interested in the VS Find Your Voice Campaign since it features women of
colour. She wants to know:
1) what the intended message is
2) Which agency came up with the concept and why
3) A general discussion on the campaign

Deadline: Tuesday morning or early afternoon.

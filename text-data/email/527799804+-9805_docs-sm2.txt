Re: CAMEL: Chicago Walls

This recommends that Camel replace the Chicago East Ohio Street wall with a 52' x 52' wall at Ontario/State (start date 12/10) and a 20’ x 20’ wall at Clark south of Addison (on the corner of Wrigley Field, start date 11/20). The cost is $20.6M (net + commission) per month and $246.8M for 12 months. (The cost is $23.9M for 1998 and $222.9M for 1999.)

As information, LHC estimates that the Ohio Street wall will be obstructed and canceled by early October. Funds freed-up from this unit can pay for the recommended walls.

    Reads to Ontario westbound and has a parallel exposure to State Street.
    Illumination is provided.
    Ontario Street has developed into a primary nightlife strip with Ed DeBevics, Planet Hollywood, and Michael Jordons all in walking distance of this wall.

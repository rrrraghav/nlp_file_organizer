Dear Mr. Egretry,

Please clarify the relationship, if any, between the following:

Olsanske Designation Hungary Designation German Designation
Cigarette paper Pandema 18 Grade A H25/0.50P/STP/TTCF?
Cigarette paper Pandema 25 Grade B H25/0.50P/STP/TTCF?
Plugwrap R27 PW 27 or PWNP/I27mm PW/NP/28

We think that some of these may be the same, but the information that was sent to us from your factory is not always consistent as far as nomenclature or supplier name (for example, Olipa vs Olsanske).

Please supply a supplier reference number for the Tann tipping used on Kossuth Filter. The size is not enough information.

We also still need a sample of the triacetin that you use from Akzo Chemical.

We have a November 1 deadline so I hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
Carolyn Rehn

Subject: FW: FCTC Meeting in DC Nov 14

2085802279B

One of the attendees this morning at the meeting described below was Rosemarie Henson, the new Director of the
Office on Smoking and Health. She approached me, having heard our positions on many of these issues, she
approached me and said that she would like to meet with our team that could give her details on our positions and
product work relating to:

•	protocols for assessing cigarette ingredients
•	assessing reduced risk products
•	assessing reduced risk products
•	legislation providing for FDA regulation

She seemed surprised at many of the positions that we have long taken.

Does it make sense to convene a discussion of how we might best follow up on this contact?

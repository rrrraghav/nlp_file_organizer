Agreed. Let's proceed.

I would like to know if we’ve received any feedback on the makeup HIU plans to do for the delay on getting the special event available???

Jordan, as you know all of the baskets in our special event will have baseboards with images displaying our print creative. Attached are jpegs with backups of each. We are fine with all of them except for Comic Book Woman and Eggshell Mosaic. We’ve asked the designers to crop into the ad images so that the black borders are eliminated.

I welcome your feedback on this material.
Many thanks,
Adam

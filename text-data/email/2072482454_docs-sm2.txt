Can we verify that the scripting is correct regarding how often retailers can call to order catalogs.

CSRs should say that a retailer can call to order catalogs once a day. In the beginning of the last program we said once a week. We were concerned about not having sufficient catalog inventory since proved not to be an issue so we can allow retailers to call and order catalogs more often - once a day.

Thanks

Laura,

GIFTs training was coming up after I informed you that I would be available for the video conference meeting on Thursday, November 16. I discussed this with Karen and she advised me to attend the GIFTs training because I’m in the core team for this. I informed Karen that I won't be able to attend the conference call meeting due to schedule conflict. Sorry for the change with such a short notice. Thanks. Yuqian

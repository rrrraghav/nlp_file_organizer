Subject: Cambridge Repositioning - Core Team

I'd like to invite each of you - or one of your representatives - to join me in a series of meetings to revitalize the Cambridge brand and effectively reposition it. I have already been working with many of you towards this goal, but it is now time to formalize these efforts.

To that end, I’d like to start bi-weekly meetings for Tuesdays, from 11-12 in 8a1/a2, to create, develop and implement all the elements to successfully relaunch Cambridge. I chose this time because it comes right after the Discount promotion weekly meeting which many of you already attend. Please let me know if this time works for you. For those of you in Richmond, we can conference call you in, so please let me know if this works for you as well.

During this first meeting, I’ll explain the purpose of this repositioning and bring you up to speed on some of the wonderful work that has already been done. Together; we will create a plan to pull this off and create some excitement about Cambridge.

I look forward to seeing you all on Tuesday.

Thanks, Denise @ 3-3415

Hi Maura,

Here are some answers to your questions:

The file size is 56K.

The file will be in Acrobat reader 2.1.

The file will be sent to people in the field and NY. The field distribution will include TSM,
UM, DM, SAM, SOM, SSD, TMP, TMM, NAM. I will get you a complete list
of field and NY later today.

I am working on the CD and diskette cost with sales training.

Please let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,
Bonnie

Susan,

KD and I will be coming to DC for an afternoon meeting on the 21st...just a question, any reason for us to come by your place and look at documents, etc. in the morning?

I'm not looking to extend our stay down there, but also don’t want to miss a chance to keep project moving forward

pls advise

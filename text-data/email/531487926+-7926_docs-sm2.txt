<br><br>Subject: Three Q&amp;A<br><br>Hi Bonnie, 
Ok, on the third question, however, I would steer away
from suggesting that we’re likely to nationalize this product or repositioning. Just stick with this is just a test
market in NY's five boroughs and long island, and no decision has been made beyond
that.<br><br>Original Message<br><br>From: Reese, Bonnie L.<br><br>Sent: Friday,

W.<br><br>Subject: Three Q&amp;A<br><br>Hi Richard, I left a voice mail message for you this morning, but
thought I’d quickly recap the three questions.<br><br>Question: African Americans predominantly smoke
menthol cigarettes. Are we targeting black and other minority smokers with our new product?<br><br>Possible Response:
Absolutely not. There is a wide variety of people who smoke menthol cigarettes, and our new ad campaign
was designed to appeal to a broad base of adult menthol smokers.<br><br>If needed, to be glad to refer you
to our Public Relations Dept., if you’d like.<br><br>Question: What is the difference between the two
blends we're using existing styles?<br><br>Possible Response: The blend in our three new box styles has
a richer, tobacco taste with a smoother, menthol taste in our current existing styles.<br><br>Question: Are
you going to change the name of the product? <br><br>Possible Response: At some
point, we will be natural transition outside the NY Test Market set fairly nationally-align. Depending
on the test market results, we may or may not do that.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Bonnie L.
Reese<br><br>

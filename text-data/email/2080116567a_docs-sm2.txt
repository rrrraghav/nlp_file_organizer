Subject: Prevention in Richmond Public Schools

Good morning, Mr. Fernandez,

Tom Donahue asked me to contact you about prevention programming in the Richmond Public Schools. I have been working with the Richmond schools for six years in the development and evaluation of effective violence prevention programs. In addition to contacting the superintendent for parent-employee-community and business engagement (Dr. Jewel Jackson), I believe, you might want to contact the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA). This agency provides prevention services to the public schools—they currently do both life skills program in a number of elementary schools. The director is Brenda McNeal; her number is 819-4030. This arrangement works very well, as RBHA provides services, but is not under the authority of the superintendent. Therefore they are not subject to the frequent changes which occur in that office.

I hope this is helpful for you. Please contact me if you need additional information.

Sincerely,

Althea Meyer

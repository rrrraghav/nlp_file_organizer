Enza,

Four consultants that will be involved in the 1/24 Sr Team presentation will arrive at the NY office first thing Monday morning. We plan to begin going over some revisions of our presentation at 9am in the 26th floor conf. room.

They will need to get in the building and I instructed them to say they were visiting Jack. Since they are contracted employees, I assume the desk will call up to you/Jack before letting them come up. Would it be possible for you to help facilitate their entry and direct them to the conference room on 26?

Their names are: Martin Browning from EduQuest company, Art Levine from Arnold & Porter (he may arrive with me) and Ed McDonnell & Tom Meyers from Quintiles BRI Company.

I imagine they will arrive around 8:45am.
Thanks, Enza! Judy

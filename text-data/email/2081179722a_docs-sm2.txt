Subject: carton end sticker

Suzanne,

If you recall, we had originally planned “Find Your Voice” tear tags for the packs and "Find your voices" end stickers for
the carton. Based on the carton designs the agency presented a couple of weeks ago, I am foregoing the carton end
stickers for the carton designs. Please advise if you have another POV.

thanks

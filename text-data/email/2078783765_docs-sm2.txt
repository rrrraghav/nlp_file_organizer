Subject: SGA-YSP-IMD working group

Attached are revised notes from our last meeting in Dec. and subsequent discussions with several of you.

Please review carefully and provide feedback, we need to finalize this general outline and then move forward with implementation.

Clearly some of these items are long term efforts, but we need to provide tools to the RD’s, and more importantly, a broad plan they can utilize in their own states in '99 and beyond.

Scott/Pam/Henry/Dan -- we need to pull a real plan together for each of the legislative orgs listed in the plan, and perhaps others. BUJ, we must coordinate with YS and follow their lead re: thoughts on how best they can support/complement our efforts. And there is the issue of over committing YSP and being stretched too thin that we must always consider.

I am happy to work with each of you along with KD, in pulling those plans together, with an emphasis on substantive policy results, not PR. As meetings are fast approaching, how does the end on January sound for a deadline?

Josh/Tom/Chris -- what’s the status of the state research, both state and fed dollars? Do we need to meet again re: the studies of states and their various approaches to the issue of youth smoking?

Chris -- you and I need to set a date and meet with the attys for a little legis. drafting, and as we discussed, we need to do that ASAP.

All -- What am I forgetting?

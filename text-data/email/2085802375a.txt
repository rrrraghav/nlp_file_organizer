Subject: CommuniSpeak Contract – Presentation #4

Ellen - I wanted to get back to you on behalf of the Professional Development Council to address your questions about the CommuniSpeak contract, the vendor that the Professional Development Council selected to conduct the two-day Executive Presentation Skills Seminar in Richmond, Nov 12th and 13th.

You asked:
1. Who will be attending?; and
2. How did we choose this vendor?

First, below is the most recent list of attendees... We still have space for 4 additional attendees due to some recent schedule conflicts/travel concerns.. Attendees were selected by their managers after Cheri sent an e-mail to Terry, Mike and Liz asking for nominations based on individual developmental needs and interests.

Second, we first heard of CommuniSpeak through Darline McQuen who was able to take the same course offered by them several years ago. She spoke very highly of the quality of their training and the information and, it turns out, CommuniSpeak is the vendor they’ve used for a few years to do presentation skills training. Based on positive recommendations about the course, we then met with CommuniSpeak to make sure their program fit our needs. We were impressed with their ability to individualize the training for everyone in the group despite level of experience.

List of attendees:
1. Holly Borgmann
2. Danielle Burenstein
3. Alexandra Crotty
4. Kim Farrow
5. Denise Koenig
6. Philip Phillips
7. Cheri Sestorak
8. Keith Stansel
9. Liz Warmer
10. Monique Table
11. Mary Thompson
12. Patty Wells

Please let us know if you have other questions or need additional information. Thank you.

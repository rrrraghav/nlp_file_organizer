The computer hardware which will run the Media Management System is being
installed this week . The application will be loaded and tested this week
also. If there are no problems, we will begin loading the inventory as early
as next week.

All of the media is in off-site storage except R&D. They are loading the
media into containers and should begin shipments to the off-site location
this week or next. Jon Tab was on vacation last week and does not return
until 9/11. This may explain some of their delay.

Jon Tab, John Ruiz and I will visit Seattle this week along with Dan Shinn.

Jerry Ward is continuing to research possibilities with processing the IBM
mail systems. This is to provide alternative approaches if necessary.

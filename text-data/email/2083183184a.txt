Subject: RE: 3rd Party POS

Given everyone's schedule, we’re going to do this in 2 parts. On Thursday, July 13 from 1:30 - 2:30
Y&R will show creative to Carolyn, KD and me.

I will then take Jeanne, Christina and Marti through it either on Friday when they return, or early next week.

AB/CW - if you’re around on Thurs, please join us.

Kim: please book a room for Thursday and advise.

Thanks.

Subject: Electronic Versions of PM WHO Submission Translations

Importance: High

Attached at Evan’s request are electronic copies of the French, German, Japanese
and Russian translations of the final PM WHO submission. Please discard prior
faxed translations as the enclosed reflect minor changes to conform with the
final English version.

Could the appropriate native speakers please review these translations and make
any corrections prior to release? Also, please make sure that any corrections
are communicated back to us so that we have them for our records.

Thanks,

Jamie Prince

Note to Shinichiro: The Japanese version didn’t open properly on my machine, but
when I checked with the translators, they said that it should open normally on a
computer equipped with Japanese fonts & software. Please let us know if you have
any problems.

Subject: Reporting/Correspondence

From this point forward, please address all billing, reporting, and other general correspondence previously addressed to Chuck Wall to me. Copy me, rather than Chuck, on matters addressed to others that you were previously copying for information or as a courtesy to Chuck. All matters describing your involvement, frustration, or concerns related to your role as counsel to PM should continue to be directed to someone other than me. Thanks

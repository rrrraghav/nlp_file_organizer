David Curle from Richmond called asking about the note below and similarly whether or not we can send replacement cigarettes to consumers in NY who have a product complaint. I vaguely remember that we didn’t have a problem sending replacement product into Minnesota and I thought we were leaning towards resuming sending replacement product in NY but I wanted to check with you before responding.

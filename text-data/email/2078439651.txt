Subject: revised LST model comm plan

At our meeting in Richmond, I agreed to take a crack at revising the plan again... just
a few changes, such as dates added. Please take a look and let me know if you
have additional comments/suggestions. Please feel free to forward this draft to your
colleagues, if appropriate. (I know Bennie is out of the office)
Thanks

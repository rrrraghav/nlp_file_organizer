Subject: Vision outline & overheads for CTF sessions

Attached is the approved outline for the "vision" presentation being given to hourly audiences at
Creating The Future. I do not know when each of you is delivering the Operations vision (Part 1 -
“The Big Picture”) over the course of the year, so I wanted to be sure you all received a copy of
this outline via e-mail.

* Part 1 is the part you would deliver, with the supporting overheads (which are already loaded
on a laptop at the Homestead).
* The Part 2 outline is included just FYI (the GMs are delivering the more plant-specific
information).

The Part 1 overheads are included so you can see how the "slide builds" to match key points in
the presentation.

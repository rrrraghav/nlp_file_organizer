I enjoyed the talk you gave recently at Philip Morris. My background is chemical engineering. I have read articles on genomics and seen presentations. For me, they are typically either too geared for specialists, or simple, but with lots of hype. I am often left with the impression that genomics is much too complex, or that everything is in order and if I sit back, great things will happen.

Your talk, by contrast, led me to think, and to want to know more about human genomics. Thank you for cutting through the hype and presented a fascinating tale of scientific discovery.

If you could suggest a primer on the subject of human genomics, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Pete

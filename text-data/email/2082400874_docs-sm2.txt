Jeanne,

I have enclosed the final version of the Chain Volume Request. We have labeled this as request number B1060. It was produced from the MCP SAS History week ending 9/28/98.

There were some changes made to the request.

* We changed the completeness store count to include active and completeness checks for 56 out of 65 weeks. This is just a store count and does not have an impact on the volume reported.

* We were unable to provide the Retail Masters Y/N column. This was excluded from the report.

* The total store counts for 1997 and 1998 are calculated based on the current definition of stores within a chain. This means that the stores associated with the chain in the current time period will be the same stores checked on the 1997 history. We do not keep old assignments of retail lids to a particular chain. Therefore there would not be a difference between the counts. We created one column with the total STARS stores and another based on the Retail Masters stores.

* The CPY values are based on the average per chain within a week. We pulled the data from LINQ and collapsed it by chain. Then that value was divided by the total number of retail lids within the chain.

If you have any questions, just let me know.

Sandy

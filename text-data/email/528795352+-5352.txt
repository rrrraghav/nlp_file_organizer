While it is true that smoking incidence among high schools seniors has dropped dramatically during the past 15
years, it has leveled off recently. One reason is that once it gets to a certain low level it gets harder and harder
to get it lower. It gets a bit complicated. So, I look out here that might get you in a bind of having to
explain something that won't fit into a sound bite. Anyway, some is the cite we use: "The Department of
Health and Human Services annual survey shows that over the past 15 years (1978 vs. 1994) a decline of
smoking in every category they measure."<lb>Percent Ever Used: 17.7% decline<br>
last 30 days: 15.0 % decline<br>
Daily: 29.5 % decline<br>
1/2 pack daily:
40.4 % decline<br><br><br>

Eric,

Since both of the interns are attending NACS, they should both have a brief media training session in the immediate future with Nelson Fernandez.

Also, all of you should know that given the tenure of the interns, I will ask Jamie to stay the entire time.

Eric, please coordinate the training with Tim Bird.

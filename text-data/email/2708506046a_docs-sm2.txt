Hi Dwight,

All the numbers for stage 2 sign-off match with the exception of Marlboro. The Monarch counts for Marlboro are higher than the Acio counts. I think it’s kind of weird. Can you help me figure out why? Could it be a problem with the way we're looking at the 200 and 300 series program numbers? I don’t know but it doesn’t seem right that only one brand’s numbers are different.

Subject: Project Tomorrow Proposed Markets

I met with Tom Saloun last week to discuss which markets would be appropriate for Project Tomorrow per the decisions made at the last RPC meeting.

We have identified the tentative markets as being:

Unidentified test
Milwaukee
Buffalo

Identified test
Hartford
Kansas City

Tom’s group will need a few more days to verify that these markets are indeed OK from a marketing research/tracking point of view.

Before we commit to these as final, please review with whomever you deem appropriate in your areas.

Judy / Tony - Please forward this note to our colleagues on the Core Team as appropriate.

Mary - It’s been a little while since we've caught up. Please let me know what your availability is for a full briefing.
Are you free this afternoon?

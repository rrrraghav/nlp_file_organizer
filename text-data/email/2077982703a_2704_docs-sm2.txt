Subject: Frosina-ABC Formula Documents

John:

Are you okay with this production going forward in this manner?

I will continue discussions with Joseph about the secure room and arrange for Rolf to do a survey,
especially if we are agreeing to the production of Cat II docs in Frosina. I will also work with Joseph and
Hunter on the glyphing issue. (I assume that if we go ahead with Cat II production and we are unable to
arrange for glyphed copies, we will produce on red paper in the interim and replace the red
paper with glyph ped copies when they become available.

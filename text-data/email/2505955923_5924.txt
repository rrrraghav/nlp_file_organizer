Subject: TES abstract for review

Dear Colleague:

I have prepared an abstract for a poster describing our study design for the Total Exposure Study. The goal is to present this work at the 9th International Congress of Toxicology in Brisbane, Australia in July of this year. This draft is brief, but the instructions to authors require that the abstracts be in Times New Roman 8 and no more than 77mm wide by 102mm long.

Please review the draft and provide me your comments by the end of business on 22-January-01. The submission deadline is February 5. Thanks in advance for your feedback.

I’m suggesting Roger as the presenter. If you want more information on the meeting, check out http://www.uq.edu.au/ICT9/.

I look forward to your comments.

Afternoon Stacey...

I had been working with Lisa on this but from here on out, will keep you and Brad in the loop, too.

The last conversation I had with McLane was moments before John sent his e-mail, I explained to him that the numbers in MIDAS match "to the carton" with the data in the files they have submitted. I suggested to John that he contact McLane IS department as they have access to all three entities (their sales history...and the programs that generate both sets of data that they send to Pittsburgh).

John had stated that McLane TS should have had some results as of this past Monday -- although, I personally suspect that it would take a little more time for them to react/investigate than what John had offered. I have not yet received a follow-up from John...but have a note to give him a call on Monday.

As a side note, during the initial conversation with John Mayer (Corp. Merch) and Jack MacIver (from Suneast D.C.), they both acknowledged that not only did the "PM numbers" look too low, but that their “STARGAZER numbers” looked way to high.

I'll let you know what, if anything, comes of the conversation on Monday.

Enjoy the weekend...Bill

Subject: Eclipse/Nebraska Calls

Attachments:

If possible, I'd like to know if when we begin to receive
calls from Lincoln, Nebraska. Since the video has the 800#,
the brand is anxious to be alerted that we are receiving
inquiries. (Something general, nothing detailed, but enough
to know that the call came from Nebraska as a result of the
video mailing.)

As a reminder, anyone from Lincoln should be given the
following "new" information about Eclipse:

** 80% less second hand smoke
** No smoke off the lit end
** Virtually no lingering odor
** Practically no staining
** Price will be the same as other Full price brands in
Lincoln

T/N
Full Flavor 4mg tar /.2 mg nicotine
Milds 3mg tar/.2 mg nicotine

Thanks for your help!

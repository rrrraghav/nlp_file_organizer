Subject: Circulation of Revised Discovery Responses - Format

As the flow of draft discovery responses picks up, it is becoming extremely difficult and unnecessarily time
consuming to review revised drafts if they are neither, 1) in red-line format, or 2) accompanied by a cover
memo outlining the revisions.

To enable us to keep up with the volume, we ask that you make certain that all persons in your firms
working on discovery responses be reminded that they are to comply strictly with 1 or 2 above. In addition
it would be extremely helpful if each draft were sequentially numbered in the upper right hand corner, so
that there will be no confusion during discussions as to the proper draft under consideration.

Please pass the word. Thanks,

Dave

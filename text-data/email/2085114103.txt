Hi Jamie-

As you can see there are 4 versions of the MES Mailing outlined as follows:

1) The Intranet desktop to all PM USA Employees who have access to computers.
2) The Intranet desktop to the Field Sales Force—we specifically call attention to the fact that they will be getting the brochure in the mail as they don’t have an office to pickup brochures.
3) FSF Mailing: This is the version we need to mail them the brochure to FSF employees who get the electronic desktop and so we have altered the lang. to say, “Enclosed is a copy of the new YSP booklet.”
4) The Intranet desktop which must be posted on the bulletin boards in the plant communities for employees w/o computers.

As we moved forward w/ the desktop details, we realized that a single letter (what you originally approved) would have alienated a large number of employees and as such, the minor modifications have been made w/o impacting content.

Let me know if you have any questions.

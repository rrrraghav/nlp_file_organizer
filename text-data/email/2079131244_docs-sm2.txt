Hi Marge,

Question for you... we're in the process of pulling together some information for Marlboro’s 2001 plan. LBCo. sent over a chart that reflects an uptick in the number of YAS on the database from May to June.

This might be a long-shot, but we're not sure what contributed to this... could it have been the purchased names from 4th

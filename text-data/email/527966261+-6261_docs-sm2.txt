Here are revised charts to go with your key message point. Please forward to anyone you might have provided the originals to.

We revised theses charts because (percentage change in youth smoking for Illinois) has number and two time periods (California and Canada) have changed. Also, Illinois number changed from 22% California dates changed from 1989-1995 to 1988-1996. Canada dates changed from 1990-1994 to 1990-1993.

Thanks!

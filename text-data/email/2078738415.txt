Here is the letter to be sent to ANVS, marked to show Clodualdo’s comments. Could you please make sure to insert the proper accents since I don't have Portuguese accents in my computer. I deleted the last phrase of item 4 because you already have the portuguese translation of the studies. Thank you all very much and please call us if you have questions.
Regards,
fernando

i plan to raise with andy next week whether we can have some different brands and different representations of brands (ie. Red Kamel). I will let you know if i am successful.
So you know, i want to encourage him to have Winston as one of the brands as well.

FYI...
As you will recall, the annual report will feature two large pack photos for the U.S. company and two for the international company (in each case, one "core brand" and one “new and innovative” brand). RJR has selected Camel Lights and Red Kamel; RJR has selected Camel Lights (blue pack) and Salem Pianissimo.

The RJRN staff just wants us to be aware that this means 3 out of the 4 large shots are Camels of some sort -- in case this bothers anybody.

Subject: RE: Fires in Montana

Yes, we do. But our Regional Government Affairs people take the lead in recommending actions.
I’m copying Ginny Corbin in Denver who recently has had experience in Los Alamos and confronts fires in several states. Normally we would not act unless there is widespread damage and significant numbers of victims. We need to have the particulars (address, contact, phone, etc.) for the grantee. Also, we would probably check with the Red Cross to see what their needs are so we do not duplicate. Finally, we would consider a shipment of food from Kraft. So far that’s all I know. I'm also copying Kathy Spear, who is our Task Force leader for RTNA. Let’s see what Ginny says.

Thanks, Gracias, Merci, Obrigado

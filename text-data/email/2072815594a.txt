Mary,

could you please check on how limited should be the distribution of the GMO matrix document you provided. I occasionally receive requests to check the matrix from different parts of PM EU/EE/CEMA. I suggest that Legal/Compliance EU/EE/CEMA keep a copy of the matrix.
Please let me know.

Best regards,
Ferruccio

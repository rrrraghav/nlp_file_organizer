Roger:

We’re still on-track for the visit on Monday Oct 30. We have made our travel
reservations, and will be arriving LATE on Sunday Oct 29.

If possible, please send me a copy of your Organization Chart and a Process Flow Diagram.

Also, you mentioned that the Quality Manual was MASSIVE, but you could send me a copy of
the Table of Contents. That would be fine.

If you need to FAX these items, my FAX number is 336-741-6135.

Continued thanks,

Ken Baker

Jan: we’ve talked about the Wall St Journal's interesty in Romania. i have spoken with the reporter. It’s a feature, it’s tobacco specific and Romania is the focal point. It’s not directly linked to settlement, more to the eastern expansion of US tobacco companies.

I’m nervous. It’s going to be very difficult to avoid talking to the reporter, not least because she seems to be aware of the contraband problem.

We are, to be blunt, in a war here at the moment. PMI in particular are incredibly upset about some things we have done on tax, and the fact that we are killing them for market share etc.

The reporter is bound to find out about the tax...it’s plastered all over the media, a lot of quoting me.

My inclination is to meet, say all the good things about Romania, and try and make the tax issue as insignificant as possible. I can do this so long as PMI see the big picture and realize it is in no one's interest for this to be front page news in the US media.

But I’m warning you know, it may be difficult to control. If you or Tom have any ideas/advice, then please pass it on.

Adam.

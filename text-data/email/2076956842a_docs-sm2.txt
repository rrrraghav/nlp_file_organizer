Subject: Business Review of Key Quality System Terminology Round 2

As a follow up to our first terminology review meeting on May 6 we have considered your input and have incorporated many suggestions as possible. Please review the attached documents in light of your business function and plan to attend a meeting on Friday, June 19 from 1:00 to 3:00 in the QSIC Conference Room (War Room) to complete discussion of these terms.

Highlights of the changes:
1. Maintained the distinction between direct materials and tobacco;
2. Combined tobacco and direct materials under a higher level category of purchased components.
3. Eliminated consumer and customer unit; replaced with packaged cigarettes and shipping units.
4. Created a new term to describe test units which would encompass POLs, training center produced cigs and packs, etc. (not for commercial distribution)
5. P&M manufactured subassemblies are referred to as manufactured components.
6. Addition of Manufacturing Materials term instead of the broad indirect materials category.

Please confirm attendance by June 17.

Thanks,

Louis Watts, Dave Barfield, Tom Bulluck and Mary Susan Schreck

Rob,

Dr. Gallagher is very receptive and has ideas for stories. We need to identify a few good dates to meet with him so you can fill him in on details of what we have to offer. I said we’d go to his office seeing he came here this time. If it's difficult to make the time, we can ask him to come here again.

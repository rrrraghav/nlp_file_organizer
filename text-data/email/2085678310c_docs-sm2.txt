Hi,

Just want to see if there's anything else on this as I would like to send out the transmittal letters.

Also, can you please call me regarding your comments on the SGMA proposal; I didn’t understand them and have not heard back from you. We only need about 5 minutes on that one-
Eric Ostern,
Manager, Youth Smoking Prevention Programs

ps---note that the 1st Tee is not moving forward wi the research at this time as they do not have the funding they need.

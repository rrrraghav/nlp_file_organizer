I just realized that the corporate board meeting I was referring to
yesterday in my email is a large staff meeting which is larger and would
not be an appropriate forum for the Phillip Morris discussion. The next
opportunity will be Executive Committee on June 19th for the written
info you are providing. That will provide even more time for you. In the
meantime, I am continuing to work on the application. There is another
issue I want to discuss with you and will call you today.

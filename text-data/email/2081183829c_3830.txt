Subject: W. Excess Inventory Employees Sale

Jack/Joe,

The Virginia Silks brand group would like to hold an employees sale in mid-July offering items from the last VS catalog which expired in May. All items are non-branded and have no logo or indicia. The items that would be offered are listed below. Since the items are non-branded we would like to sale to be open to all employees at 1200 Park Avenue, first come first serve. We also would like to have no limits on quantity – first come first serve. The sale would be run by Margo Cochran and the profits from the sale would be split between VS brand and PMIEF.

ITEMS
Fake Fur Coat
Shawl
Knit Shirt
Purse
Skirt
Set of Pillows
Journal
Treasure Box
Set of Espresso Cups.

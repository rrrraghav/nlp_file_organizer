Dear all,

Attached are the CDC report templates for the September 1999 quarterly update.

Although the PHMC submission deadline is October 13th, 1999, we need to receive your reports in
Lausanne by TUESDAY OCTOBER 5th, THE LATEST, to allow for regional review and consolidation.

There are no significant changes from the June report format, except that we move forward one quarter
in the tables. Therefore, please make use of the report templates attached to this note.

Important reminder

- These reports are official documents that provide inputs to external disclosures. Approval by the CDC
Project Director AND the Finance Director is required.

- These reports are positioned as an important vehicle to communicate and accurately represent your
organization’s performance. Please ensure that all data is complete and accurate, and that you are
requested to provide enough details to clearly understand where you stand and what remains to be done.

- Target dates should be realistic. It's also a useful exercise when the last update was approved to give
clarity during the review.

- Currently, there are about 70 people involved (as shown on cross-reference 99-3) with a lifeline
extending to the transatlantic board. A separate communication will be addressed through a new website
to facilitate this.

For any questions, please contact Ramon Girona or David Weaver.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Ramon Girona

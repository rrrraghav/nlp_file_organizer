 Dear Franz and Hans,

 Please find attached the results of the intermediate step 2.2.
 (See attached file: VALIDATION (RESULTS STEP 2.2) PDF)

 You will see that the results are "susgooshinet". We got a higher “Slope of best fit” than before.
 The concentration factor is definitively a key point to get a relevant scale for a comparative effect assessment.

 Would you please let me know what you want us to do for STEP 3 (reproducibility/repeatability).

 Very best regards,



 Michel.

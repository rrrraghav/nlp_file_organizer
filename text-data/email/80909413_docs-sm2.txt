We need to revise the corporate principles and perhaps some other sections relating to It and Youth Sports Prevention in the Marketing Regulation Manual to reflect the changes we announced in the Informer and the reprinting of the brochure. Please take a look at what we have and get Brian to review with you the changes we need to make in it before you prepare a draft for me.

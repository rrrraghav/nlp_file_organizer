Chester's back OK; feels like it wants to come out of place. How’s Riock-no back pain or kidneys stones I hope.

Kevin O. suggested you ask DB how "footers" on presentations should read.

PM USA Presentation to PMI Senior Management - April 12, 2002 ?
PM USA Operations Presentation …
PM USA [specific dept name] Presentation …

substitute “update” for “presentation” ?

In reviewing presenters, it’s certainly not just RD&E. I've tried to think of all the possibilities.

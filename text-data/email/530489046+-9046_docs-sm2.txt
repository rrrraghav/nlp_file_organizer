Doug,

Here is the corrected sheet. I noticed that you changed the September '96 introductions
of Kernel to October. The Sales Force will be beginning to spread in September
according to Brice and Lawrence.

Also I am sending a longer list of markets that you may or may not want to add to your
list (now that you have extended beyond just the regions. I will send them via a separate
e-mail.

Emily

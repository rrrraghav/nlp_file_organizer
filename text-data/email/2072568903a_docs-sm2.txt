Subject: Re: Change Control
I currently have the Symphony change process, QS change process and IS change process requirements as part of
my proposed scope which was the point of discussion for the meeting scheduled on March 31 to finalize
requirements.

I would like to meet with yourself, Earl Herald and Trey Smith in the near future if possible, so that we can discuss this
in more detail. Let me know when we can meet, if possible, before the March 31st meeting which I have set up.

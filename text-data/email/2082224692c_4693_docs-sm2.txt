Subject: POSTER ATTRIBUTIONS

From Lynda Corney
Dear Gerry,

I’ve checked the posters from the last GOT meeting and listed the attributions below. Could you please
double check to make sure they are correct? Also, do we want the word “sponsored” or
“supported”? Or maybe something different altogether?

- INIFO/authors only:
INIFO is a research laboratory Phillip Morris International
- INIFO/CRO authors only:
INIFO and CRO are both research laboratories Phillip Morris International
- INIFO/Foreign authors only:
This work was sponsored by Phillip Morris.

It is interesting to see PAREEXELS suggestions on biomarkers for the TES.

Could our 4 biomarker specialists (and their support - Rustmeier etc.) have a look at these suggestions and give me their opinion as to whether we should consider some of the suggestions for the Total Exposure Study some time early next week?

Have a nice weekend.

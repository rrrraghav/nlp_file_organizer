Subject: Records Coordinator Training

As you are aware PHI USA is implementing a new records management program and the people listed in the attached file have been appointed Records Coordinators for your respective areas. Records Coordinator training will last a full day in mid-September. The training consists of an overview of the new processes and a half day on using the Electronic Records management computer system (ERMS). Because hands-on computer training space is limited and therefore scheduling is a little difficult, I need some input from you all on your Records Coordinators availability.

Please review the dates and times below and let me know which of these sessions they cannot attend. Please let me know by Tuesday 8/22. After I here from you all I will notify you and the Records Coordinators on the sessions they have been scheduled for. If there are any changes to the list of Records Coordinators please let me know by 8/22 so that I can update the Records Coordinator list to IS so they may begin the process of granting system permissions to these people.

When attending training, each Records Coordinator should bring a list of people for the departments they will support. This list will be used by them to begin granting system permission to there people during the hands on ERMS training. Please help your Records Coordinator procure this list prior to attending the training.

Records Process Training: September 19, 8:30 -12
Records Process Training: September 21, 8:30 -12
ERMS Training: September 19, 1:45-30
ERMS Training: September 22, 8:30 -12
ERMS Training: September 22, 1:45-30

Thank you for your help.
Mark

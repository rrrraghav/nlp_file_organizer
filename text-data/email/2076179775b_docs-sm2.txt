Attached is a records retention memo/procedure and related attachments that I plan to
distribute within I.S. Please review and let me know if you have any issues or concerns.
John Mulderig reviewed and approved this a year or so ago but I just want to make sure this
approach is still ok. I would appreciate your input.

We have just finalized the dates for our final upgrade to Gifts 4.0 due to some fixes we needed MicroEdge to do.
We are now scheduled to upgrade on Nov 1 - Nov 3 at which time I would like to have the software installed on your machines.

In addition, I would like to schedule your training for November 7 with Michelle Barbeau. Please let me know if these dates are okay with you and also provide us with a list of users and their locations.

Finally - we are developing a intranet site for Gifts and are seeking quotes. The following is what Carolyn Levy sent in re: following are demo and we would love to use it and also ask for another quote from your team - your thoughts??? Can we get Carolyn's permission??

I was VERY impressed what a great tool you’ve created
thanks so much for your help

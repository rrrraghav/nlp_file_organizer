At a news conference on 11/16, Attorneys General for several states including Washington, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New York, and Colorado announced and released a proposed settlement agreement with tobacco companies, stating the settlement "moves the fight out of the courtroom and onto the streets so we can begin protecting kids now." Under the $206 billion settlement proposal, tobacco companies would agree to “curbs on their advertising and marketing campaigns, fund a $1.5 billion anti-smoking campaign, open previously secret industry documents, and disband industry trade groups,” including The Tobacco Institute, Council for Tobacco Research, and Council for Indoor Air Research. Attorneys General for the remaining states have until Friday to sign on to the agreement.

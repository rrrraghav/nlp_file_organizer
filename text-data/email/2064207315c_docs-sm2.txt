Subject: Supplemental Thai Messages

Attached are some proposed talking points relating to Thailand that could be used to supplement the
general discussion. I think this is a useful exercise, but the “extraterritorial effect” does not make any sense. This draft
distills thinking from Mark and Betty.

We would not suggest getting into how our cigarette brand names might be present in the Thai
market. Any suggestion that we need to consider this is incorrect. The environment is such that elements,
which could be characterized as “important” in Thai-adult environments, are unlikely for certain
types of products (e.g., a Marlboro Country-like Western scene) cannot be closely associated with the brand
(e.g.).

Please feel free to make any comments or suggestions.

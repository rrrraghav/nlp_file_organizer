Jen,

Thanks for your diligent follow up. Since I am gone until October 24th, I am going to ask Ankur to assist with this. Also, it will be easier for them since Y&R works with the communications group daily. Ankur, can you please do this and confirm? Also, please ensure the $465,000 printing gets charged to us. Thanks for your help, Ankur.

LETS PROCEED ASAP!!!!

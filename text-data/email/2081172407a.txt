I had a long conversation with Mary JO. I’m fine with the follow up to the specific incident & the handling of the corporate affairs contribution.

However -- I'm really concerned (very cynical) about what might be happening. I suspect this was not by coincidence. I'm not sure how much it was preplanned -- but Mary Jo can share with several different scenarios that we brainstormed.
Mary Jo promised to keep on alert for any unusual activity in the current 3 markets -- and is going to think about whether there are any preventative steps we can/should take.

If it happens again in another market -- I'm not sure what we are going to need to do. But I don’t think we can continue to push ahead and be a target.

Lets plan to talk again after we see what goes on in the current markets.

Thanks,
Suzanne

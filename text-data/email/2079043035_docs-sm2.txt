Subject: Sea Island Rehearsals

The open Sea Island rehearsal date on Wednesday, April 5th has been canceled.

The next Sea Island rehearsal is scheduled for Tuesday, April 11th (8:00 - 12:00 on the 26th floor), at which time Miller will present again and I will review the Financial Highlights and other important items.  John
Bowlin might have a conflict on the 11th, which I am following up on. I will send another note confirming or changing this date when I know more.

Regards,

Bill (3-2114)

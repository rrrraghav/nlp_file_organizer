Subject: RE: DOH Presentation

Dear Ruth,

Thanks for the messages. I will be able to meet with you on Thursday and
Friday. What time do you want to start on Thursday?

Most of the points raised by yourselves on the content of the presentation
I believe are covered. However, I do not have any firm information on
sales of product with regard to nicotine deliveries and soluble ammonia
levels etc. If your guys gave some data on this issue we can incorporate it
into the presentation.

Graham Smith has just informed me about a proposed meeting on the 29th Sept
to discuss plans for the co-op/lithobromine presentation. Unfortunately I
will be at BDW in Louisville for that date and thus will not be available.
Maybe we can discuss timings etc for this issue when we meet next week.

Regards

Mike

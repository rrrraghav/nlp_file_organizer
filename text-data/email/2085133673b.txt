Subject: voucher tracking

Raaka and I have derived a plan to ensure that all vouchers are tracked and included in the budget. Please review the details below:

* Once a voucher is signed by a manager, one copy needs to be made by either Kim or Michelle and given to Tarnyn.
Tarnyn will put into the "voucher" file that is at Tarnyn's desk.
* Once the voucher is signed by all parties and is stamped by AP, two copies need to be made and given to Tarnyn.
Tarnyn will put into the “stamped voucher” file at Tarnyn’s desk.

Raaka and I will be responsible for tracking the vouchers for John Hyde and for our individual budgets. Let me know what you think of this plan or if you have any questions/concerns. Thanks so much

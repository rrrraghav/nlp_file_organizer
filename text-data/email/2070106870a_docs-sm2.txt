Elissa:

As per your instructions of this morning attached please find samples of what was done with Indy transparencies concerning last years Miami Grand Prix promotion in Latin America. As discussed to you on my note of the 23rd, we would like to use new photos for posters, banners, counter displays and print (in Latin america only: Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic). Please reply as soon as possible as this is a time sensitive issue for us.
Thank you for your help and support.

Best regards,

Miguel

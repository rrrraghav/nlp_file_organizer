I saw the IC and assumed it was made from the last Covance IC for the pilot study. We may have to expect that all sites having their own IRB may come up with slightly different ICs.

Hans;

Chris Nelson called me this morning with a question about the draft Informed Consent for the TES Multi-Center study from Covance. Essentially, he is questioning why we are considering to use a new (Covance’s) format for the Informed Consent. Given the time and input already put into the TES IC format used with the MDS studies, he is trying to understand our rationale for introducing another IC format.

I wasn't sure whether this based on the IC used in the TES pilot study, nor was I entirely clear on the rationale (does each CRO have their own IC format?), so I told him I would talk to you and get back with him as soon as possible.

He will review the Covance IC as is, if that is want, but I think he ultimately raises the question from the standpoint of consistency. Please let me know your thoughts/rationale so that I can get back to him.

Thanks,
Valerie

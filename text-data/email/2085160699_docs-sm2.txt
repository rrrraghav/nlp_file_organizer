Subject: Coupon Print Quantities

Hi there. I’d like to try to tighten up where we stand with our subsequent coupon [and survey] print quantities and schedule.

Taking a look at what's been printed and delivered to date, we certainly do not need the print as many coupons as originally planned for the March/April Batch [3].

FMI has received the following:

1,485,109 - Batch 1
2,313,000 - Batch 2

That’s a total of 3,828,109.

3,500 stores were completed in November and December, and 4,000 stores are planned for January. I'm assuming 6,833 stores for February. With that volume of stores, I estimate that a total of 2,364,945 coupons would be needed [165 coupons per store]. That would leave an average of 1,463,164 coupons.

Assuming again that we would do 6,833 stores in both March and April, we’d need an additional 791,726 coupons printed to cover all stores.

I've put together a spreadsheet that may make this a little easier. What I will need from FMI is a confirmation/estimate of the number of stores you will cover per month. Obviously, that will ultimately drive the print quantities.

If we are in agreement that Batch 3 should be around 800M, that quantity should be delivered by 2/15/01 which means we’d be going to press week after next. Let's try to confirm this early next week.

Thanks!

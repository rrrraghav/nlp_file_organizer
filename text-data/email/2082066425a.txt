Dear Jan,

I am writing about odor acceptability claim and graph on our style book.
Thank you for forwarding me the Melissa’s report. Now Dentsu is revising the curve of the graph on our style book.

Other than the graph curve, are you fine with our style book such as our claims and the odor acceptability graph format which graph is upside down. Mild (lower acceptability) is marked at higher on the graph than Beta
(higher acceptability). Please confirm if vertical axis is “Odor” or “Acceptability”.

We need to tell your comment to Legal department and would like to have your comment today(7/17 US time).
I am sorry to trouble you many times.

Thank you very much.
Kanta

Subject: RE: PMMC B-CHAIR/ICT ROLE

Anything that needs to go up "physically" (i.e., not electronically) to US
employees at PMI and KPI (i.e. Rye Brook) should be sent to Rye Building
Services -- to the attention of Jason Moglia. Therefore, for Rye Brook
(KPI/PMI) please ensure all hard copy materials are sent to him directly.
I can't speak for Tarrytown or Stamford.

I think another effective way to promo this would probably be to also set up an
e-mail deskdrop. BC

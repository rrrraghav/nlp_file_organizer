Jordan,

According to Larsen, both of your concerns have been addressed. Check out the staging site at www.buttonnow.com/uzu.

Unfortunately, my computer setup does not allow me to look at screensavers. I am getting this issue resolved as soon as possible but let me know if you have any more concerns.

If I don’t hear from you, congratulations and good luck next week!

Have they also looked into my complaint that there is a palpable three-or-so second delay from when you click 'exit' until you’re ‘released’ back to your computer?

Hi Jordan,

I believe it has been taken care of on the buttonnow staging site, but am waiting for confirmation from Larsen. I feel you know as I find out.

Thanks,
Jason

Jason

Still waiting to find out the fix on the "Falling Apart" screensaver. As I reported last week, the current model doesn’t appear to have ANY audio (and did ensure that the mute button was unchecked).

Please update me @ this function so we may make the new screensaver live.

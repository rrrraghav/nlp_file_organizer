Subject: Tobacco Companies' efforts to develop a product with reduced health risks.
Philip Morris is working on what tobacco companies are doing (or have done) to
develop cigarettes that have less health risks. His question to PMI is: "What is Philip Morris doing,
if anything, to develop a cigarette that has reduced health risks?" The reporter is particularly
interested in knowing if PMI is developing/working on a “smokeless” cigarette.

Subject: Deutsche Telekom Assessment

Dear all,

You received on Friday 18th a note from Jean-Marc Genier which explains the status and responsibilities concerning the assessment of Deutsche Telekom. We are responsible for the assessment of Deutsche Telekom. We already received a fax from [NBI FO] saying that Deutsche Telekom answered to their RFI and they confirmed in writing to comply with all Y2K requirements in due course.

Deutsche Telekom is a High critical MIS Business Partner and our methodology requires an on-site survey. We see the need for a joint visit of NBI FO and of course KJS Germany). Could you please discuss together and let us know who is going to take in charge the visit.

Best regards,

Salvatore Dino

OK, Nat, we have been fairly warned; we can be present, but must keep our gaps firmly in place.

John,

I just wanted to let you know I have no problem with Nat sitting in
on the interview with Paul. We can set up a time that's convenient
I am there to interview Paul and not RJ’s PR department.

As far as any specific documents, I think I mentioned some in my
previous email to you back on Nov 16.

because we are interested in discussing include: the purging of
documents; the reasons for doing so; memos that have been done
been done to protect the company legally.

One indication is through a Dec 12, 1988 memo from Murray Senkus
to Max Crohn. Senkus was responding to Crohn regarding a meeting they
had where Crohn asked how reports could later prove damaging to
the company if released (Bates no: 0013-0016).

Another document we’d like to get some answers on is the May 1,
1982 memo from Fred Panzer to Horace Kornberg that talks about how
the company handled a situation where they were accused of
illegal action due to public policies and public
opinion (Bates no: 0017-0020).

The memo goes on to say: “While the strategy was brilliantly
conceived, it has been my observation that we have not implemented
it to be a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it is being used
like a holding strategy, consisting of throwing out a few crumbs
without actually doing anything.”

I also think it’s important to talk to Bruce R.J. should be
aware of this memo as well. The subpoenaed documents related to
the situation are in the file I referenced earlier. The PR director
at that time was Cary J. Budde, 135-2011, and I've talked to two
other engineers and documenters who were involved with this about
this.

Best,

Sam

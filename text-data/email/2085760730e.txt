Molly,

April 17th is a very good day for myself, Milt and the training room here in
the office. I hope that this day is still good for you. Hopefully, if contacted
soon, the organizations will have plenty of notice.

As far as the check packets and who is going to contact these
organizations, I’ll leave that up to you and Yuqian to decide. After we
confirm the date, feel free to call me to discuss the specific details.

Thanks and look forward to speaking with you.

Subject: RE: Open Enrollment

The third session started on October 3rd and is going well. Here is the latest roster for the sessions:

<< File: Third offering 5-9.xls >> << File: Third offering 10-15.xls >>

I will pass along that information to the employee (re: the retail situation).
Thanks,
Roberta

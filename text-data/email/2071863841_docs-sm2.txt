Kim and Bennie,

Can you get updates from your respective colleagues and do a call with me this week or next? Next Friday isn't good for me, and I know the week of Dec 6 is tight for everyone. If not, I’ll re-issue the activity reports and ask for written updates.

Let me know, at which time I’ll let everyone know how we will proceed.

thanks.

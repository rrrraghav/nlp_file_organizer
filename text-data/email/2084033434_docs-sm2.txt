Subject: RE: RMA Compliance Records Retention

Susan -

Claire raises a good point re records retention. You should review your functional records retention schedule and make determinations about whether the records are under disposal suspension. If they are, they must be retained until the disposal suspension is lifted. If they are not, they must be retained in accordance with your retention schedule. If you have questions about the application of the schedule, contact your records coordinator or Lewis Cummings. They can coordinate as necessary with other records management resources within PM. Thanks.

Subject: Ment on Color Foil

Joyce - We are conducting a feasibility study to develop specifications for mentholated foil. Here is the objective:

• Develop menthol on foil specifications (GC Test mg/150 ft) for all of the PM Material Codes for the seven base sheet foil products [19# Gold = 51.8 g/m² , 19# Green = 51.8 g/m², 19# Silver = 50.1 g/m², 19# Silver = 50.5 g/m² , 19# Silver = 51.8 g/m², ]25# Gold = 51.6 g/m², & [25# Silver = 68.4 g/m²] by conducting process capability analysis using the Opk 1.5 methodology approach developed by The Specification Development Team in 1998.

• Project Scope:
• Develop menthol on foil specification limits by the methodology specified above, and verify that the cigarette
subjective and analytical (menthol delivery) at these specification limits are acceptable.

Now, we have to know if we should develop specs for menthol application on color foils.

Please fill me in.
Thanks

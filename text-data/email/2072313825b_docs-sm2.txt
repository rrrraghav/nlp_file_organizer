Even,

Don't be horrified. When there is too much to do, it is impossible to remember everything. Yesterday, Karlson Schmidt took the position, prompted by Helmut Reiff, that to meet with the German Minister of Health with a publication already in hand would be counter productive. This position carried the day. Therefore, the document will not be published. I think that I can speak for all of us when I say we are involved, even marginally, in this effort that this decision is consistent with our position. Now we can go on to the next step.

Best regards.



Ted

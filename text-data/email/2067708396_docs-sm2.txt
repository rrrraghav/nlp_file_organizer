Leslie,

The live attached abstracts are respectfully submitted for the TSRC Editorial Committee's consideration.

The fifth abstract may, or may not, be appropriate for inclusion within the conference program. As we have discussed,
the authors of
these papers would like to use the first four time slots for presentation only, followed by a panel discussion with the
conference attendees. It is possible that there will be very few questions from the floor (if recent conference history is an indication
of what to expect), but perhaps such a format will stimulate discussion.

Thank you for your kind consideration of this matter.

Mike <<2000MFB1.doc>> <<2000MFB2.doc>> <<2000MFB3.doc>> <<2000MFB4.doc>> <<2000MFB5.doc>>

PS - I will leave hard copies in your chair in a few minutes.

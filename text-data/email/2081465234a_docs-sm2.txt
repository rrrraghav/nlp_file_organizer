Subject: Message points for GMO tobacco
Importance: High

Attached are DRAFT message points regarding 4 lots of tobacco that tested positive for small amounts of genetically modified contaminants. The messages will be used for REACTIVE purposes only, however we fully anticipate media interest late this week or early next week.

As you review this language, please note your comments in red, bold or underline so I can track your edits.

Please respond to me as soon as you comfortably do so, and I will begin to consolidate the edits.

Legal team: for now, this is merely a heads up – I will send you another draft that reflects all business input.

This communication is confidential and is a DRAFT, for discussion purposes only.

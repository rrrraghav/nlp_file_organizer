Ed,

Attached are two versions of the subject templates. One set
is for the TMG environment and the other for the BPO
environment. As a group, we have not had the time to sit
down and go through these again; however I have asked the
TMG staff to review these documents and let me know if
there are any major issues prior to your issuance tomorrow.
If you don't hear from me, they can go as is.

Let me know if you have questions.

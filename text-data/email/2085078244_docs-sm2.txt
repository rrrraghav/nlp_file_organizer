OK, not a problem. They are located within the City limits, though about as far as you can get towards the suburbs without crossing out of the City.
The school is located in what we call the Far Northeast, which is primarily a white middle class neighborhood. They want to consider themselves to be part of the City. We’ll be interested to hear your report on the diversity of the student body since their website
(http://www.philadelphiaacademy.org/index.html) promotes it as an institution committed to diversity. The school is run by a for-profit company. The website is pretty poor – not much info to be had there. ccc

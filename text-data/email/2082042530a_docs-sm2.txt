Subject: Agreement - TE Pilot Study

Kevin,

Just to close the loop with regard to our conversation yesterday - in your estimation it would be possible to have an agreement prepared to send to the CRO candidate we choose (for execution of the Total Exposure pilot study) the week of August 14th.

I spoke with Bristol to confirm whether additional information was needed from us at this time; she was not aware of any, but said she would let us know if she did.

So please let Roger or me know if you need additional information in order to move forward. Otherwise, we will keep you apprised of our progress with selecting a candidate.

Thanks,
Valerie

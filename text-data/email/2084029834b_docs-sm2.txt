I want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules today to meet with our Worldwide Records Management guest from PMI. They told me that the information and insight you provided will be invaluable when they embark on the same project that you have helped me with during the past year. As always, I really appreciate your help. This is an excellent example of demonstrating the company value " Sharing with Others". Thanks again, Lewis

We are checking to see what we have not received Wave 149 on Doral Order Forms and
Wave 76 on Camel Catalogs. We have received 2 waves after each of these.

Otherwise, here is the update of what we have mailed out.

Let me know if you have any issues.

(Nancy, I do hope things are improving for your father.)

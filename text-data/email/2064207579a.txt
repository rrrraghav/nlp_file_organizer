David:

Following up on our earlier discussion about this, I’m attaching for your consideration a first cut at a piece designed to point out that CTPA and their friends cloak themselves in the kids issue in order to clandestinely pursue a prohibitionist agenda.

I've not shared it with anyone else in WRA yet; let me know if you think this is worth pursuing and ideas to improve, and if you like perhaps we can discuss how to move it forward.

Mark

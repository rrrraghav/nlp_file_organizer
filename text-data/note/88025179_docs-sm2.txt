Memo from ARTHUR J. STEVENS

4/25

Dr Spears

You may recall my transmittal to
you of the attachment on 9/6/94. At
that time we agreed that you
would assist us in the preparing
a "response" - with a view toward
it going forward “early late in 1994,
or early in 1995, but no argument
prior to the 1995 Annual meeting in May.”

Perhaps you could find some time in
the next few weeks to prepare a draft.

Your cooperation is appreciated.

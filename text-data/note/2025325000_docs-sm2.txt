Future Work Required

1) RL Cutting (Chevron). Tests @ Higher O/s —
Would like to verify acceptable cutting at
higher O/s (up to ~24%) since you’re now
drying more in the rotary dryer.
(Preliminary work & R&D C Pilot Plant at
O/s up to ~47% looked OK.)

2) Dryer capacity tests —
Must determine approx. drying capacity of
refitted (existing) cylinder box, & new
rotary dryer (ex – Leg Annular).

3) Environmental —
Resolve air scrubbing questions, both in
determining acceptability of ref’d process equip;
plus air permit problems?

4) On-line prototype system - (LI or LID)
Must demonstrate physical & subjective
acceptance of prototype system in actual
production.

W thought J was - methyl bromo. test pretty good
... Good some more oxidation
Looked at 700 chars - all carbons are primary & teriary
... 90% J, rest carbons. P.O. - as best
... I.E. chows – can’t convert – but structure where may be
... L46 – common Isochemical
Then methyl & methyl polyny - in soluble toylful
... may see 70. little pale product with. weak. smplifier. Supplied
... simial carbons. best way to match it, that would
... a polycyclic spiroide (with product) change in test – not
... very in usual tests (?). 3 stills too - fairly positive?
... could – may few faint product in test (lines)

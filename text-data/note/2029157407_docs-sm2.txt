Traducida cytogenetic tests

-> root - dip mitosis only for liquids
-> pollen mitosis for gaseous and liquid
-> Trad - NCW polish works well for both solid. For in situ wound drying

Test application: –

NCW as indicator for genetic damage, since fixed chromosomes cannot be clearly stained for CA

gaseous aphids enter the buds and live the anthers
liquid “ heavy stem

(conclusion)

this cytogenetic test can be used as preliminary screening facility,
more sensitive system detects kindly than the unit-chromosomes mainly.
CA in II not reliable indicator of genetic damage because of
under chromosome image.

(_continued_)

likely: Abnormally induces mitotic delay or severe physiological drug
state monitoring very difficult

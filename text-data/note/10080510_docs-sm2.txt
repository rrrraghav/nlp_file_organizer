These data show marked differences in recorded mortality rates
from lung cancer between cities of different sizes, between cities of the
same size, and between cities in different regions.

There is no evidence of a significant correlation between per
capita smoking and rate contrasting lung cancer mortality rates. There
are, in fact, wide discrepancies. (Monroe, H.S. 1957)

Not only are there wide and inconsistent differences between
mortality rates from total lung cancer recorded as both "primary" and
“unspecified,” there are also wide differences in the relation of recorded
incidence of the two categories to one another in different cities.
All these differences are unexplained.

What do they mean in terms of accuracy and reliability of
"death certificate" data?

What do they mean in terms of accuracy and reliability of
diagnosis and differentiation between primary and metastatic lung tumors?

What do they mean in relation to any possible association with
any specific environmental factor which may be selected for study?

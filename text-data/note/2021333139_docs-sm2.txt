Dear You,

As I mentioned in the phone message
I left for you, here is a sample of paper
P3LH-2. This banded paper was prepared
in-house with the bands on the inside
of the paper as wound on the bobbin. I haven’t
confirmed exactly which cylinder was used to
print bands on this paper. The bands should
be about 4.5mm wide with a spacing of about
55-60 mm. The band slurry contains 20%
calcium carbonate, so the contrast between the
bands and background is much poorer than
any thing else we have looked at.

I think this will be a good sample for
exploring ways to improve sensitivity for
band detection.

I look forward to talking to you soon.

Take care,

Gordon

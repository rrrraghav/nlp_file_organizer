(a) TCRC paper:
Completed work to confirm with and without pad whole smoke collection and anion/cation measurements-- this with Newport 85’s and with the standard research cigarette # 1580/1725.
Anion/cation distribution occurs, being dependent on the location of the Cambridge pad and one nature of trap solvent (water to methanol and combinations thereof). Sample ion profile changes with time also recorded. Some slides for an internal presentation will be usable; the rest being gathered now. The internal deadline(DR) is - mid-July. We’ll do it.

(b) Mandy's enzymes/cellulose acetate fiber:
Memo distributed including to Bob Lake and to B.J. Craven.

     guar CaCO3 Cell malt MnO2 citr

The effect of MnO2 is real-- dose-dependence should be tested.

Maltol embodies in one molecule the whole contribution one would get from sugar browning/caramelization (e.g.; with FP-9, FP-17, RR-19 type brewing media). (These media had undergone complete Ames testing and had passed with flying colors.) The fact maltol contributes nitrogen to the smoke is a positive from the biological aspect. HMF and related furans (all…natural…) would also be key representatives of browning without Mn contribution.

(d) Tr-nes help to a sensitive area has been discussed via Jack. I can elaborate if you wish me to.

Jimmy:

(a) Most of my anion on completing time distilling whole smoke samples is limited to rapid T.V. and studies of aging which amounts to a fading standard of slides.

(b) More amines were needed (had to be devoted to solving crimes)

(d)  There happened to exist both in research and in QN. 19

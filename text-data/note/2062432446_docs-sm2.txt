FDA

To: COMMISSIONER DAVID LESSLER

I agree that minors should not smoke or have access to tobacco products.

We verify the I.D.’s of all cigarette buyers who appear to be underage.

There’s already effective regulation at the local, state and federal level. Adding government red tape and paperwork will not solve the problem of youth smoking.

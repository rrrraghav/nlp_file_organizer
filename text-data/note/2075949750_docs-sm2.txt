AVG MBRs for all 3 samples = 49
σ 2.0

w/ little or no bonding effects

Linda,

Please do Mass Burn Rate analysis on the enclosed
samples. They are described as follows:

f1 - 5343 137-1 paper w/o Avicel – control
f2 - 5344 137-1 paper w/3.0% Avicel in 7.5 micron bands 114.5 mm space.
f3 - 5345 137-1 paper w/1.8%

These rights do not self-extinguish, so I did not mark the
band locations!

Thanks very much

Bart Floyd

Bart –
Whether they self-cr or not...
quantifying mass loss in slice
regions can be of value.

Dear Sir,

I bought a carton of Camel
100’s Rights and in the carton & had
three packs of cigarettes that are coated
just like the one I am smoking you.
It does this I got them to work for me
to go back to & I called them illegal.
There was nothing they could do and
told me to write to you as
here I am. This has never happened
to me before so I hope someone
can do something. Thank you for your
time.

Dear Sirs,

Nov. 7, 1991

I have been smoking Marlboro for
many years now & playing the Marlboro
game when you saw your point.
I would like to switch over to Winston
this year but I don't know what part
of the cigarette package to sow sure
you look taken the 1 & 2 point square
box off the packs.
Could you please send me information
on what to sow & your new kontest
information. The info I have expired
September 30, 1996 for the Winston to use
sower offer.

Thanks very much. You have much
better offers to order from for women
so it would be suitch for me. I will
be looking forward to hearing about your new
offer. Do you have a phone # for information
besides the 1-800-593-9990?

Thanks very much!

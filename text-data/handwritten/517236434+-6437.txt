Gentlemen,

I purchased a carton of your
Doral Ultra Lights at Super K mart,
Store No. 3786, Milling, Ohio.
Yesterday and the coupon was
missing.

I checked the other cartons in
the display and your company was
not offering a coupon on those cartons.
Also, a week earlier while I
was at Super K mart, I purchased
a carton and realized when I
got home that my coupon had
not been removed and honored
by the cashier. (The Doral display
was set up so that the coupons
were facing to the rear, out of
sight of the buyer.) I later took
my receipt & the coupon back
to their Service Desk for credit.

I thought I would take a
moment to write and bring this
to your attention. One of the reasons
my husband buys your brand
is because of price & the coupons.



Sincerely

Mrs. Mary Tayler

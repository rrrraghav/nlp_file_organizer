Greetings:

I bought a pack of your
cigarette “The Morans”. I want
to tell you that this was the
for the "WORST" cigarette
of have ever smoked. And,
I have been smoking since 1955.
Now could you manufacture
such an awful cigarette &
just can’t believe it.
You should be shamed of your
work!!

This is all I feel &
say. Yours is the worst!

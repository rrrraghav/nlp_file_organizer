Something is wrong with these Dorals one day
after I switched to a different found the scratchy
some thread disappeared,
The carton of Dorals I did smoke cost $10.50 at
a tribal shop. The $2 off coupon you sent do
not cover the cost. I am returning the 2 unsmoked
cartons which cost $21.00 Send check or coupon
to cover the cost involved
in replacement merchandise Thank you

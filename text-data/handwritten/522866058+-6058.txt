Dear Ms. Andre:

Thank you for sharing your concerns with us regarding the Dorai carton offer. Customer feedback is very important to us, and we appreciate customers who take the time to let us know how they feel.

We certainly apologize for any misunderstanding regarding this offer. Because of restrictions in your state, we are not permitted to send fresh product directly from our factory to you through the mail. For this reason, we offer a $10 coupon to people living in states where we are prohibited from sending the product itself. The order for those living in restricted areas will receive a $10 coupon instead of a free carton.

In your letter you mentioned that you are no longer a customer. If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please sign below and return this letter in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

Sincerely,

Pat Riggs

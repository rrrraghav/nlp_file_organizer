Histamine lecture

① First step was the detå q rezonization of 5(-)-
nicotine during the binding of a aganite

② Led to the investigation of the differential metabolism
5(-)-nicotine and d-nicotine in vivo (stereo-
specificity), and the discovery of N-methylation in young pigs

③ Led to the in situ investigation of nicotine methylation
(15 both 5(-)- and R(+)- isomers) in guinea
pig tissues Style S - RS experiment
④ Led to investigation of the N-methyltransferase enzyme
responsible for the N-methylation of nicotime. stereo-
⑤ Characteristics of the N-methyltransferase were very
similar to that of histamine N-methyl transferase

⑥ Kinetics & nicotine equations

⑦ Histamine methylates states inhibiting 5(-)-nicotine

⑧ Chronic dosing experiment: nicotine
isomer state O (norm) state @(H)
state O (norm) state 4 (m.mol) state 5 (nore ep)

⑨ Smoking young pig experiments

⑩ Lung macrophage experiments Histamine - nicotime
⑪ Conclusions

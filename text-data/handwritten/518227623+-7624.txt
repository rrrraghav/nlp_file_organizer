To WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,
I HAVE SMOKED DORAH MENTHOL 100's
FOR OVER FIVE (5) YEARS. HAVE BEEN VERY
SATISFIED SO FAR. THAT IS UNTIL YESTERDAY
4-30-94. FOUR CIGARETTES IN MY PACK DID
NOT BURN AFTER IT HIT A LITTLE OVER HALF
WAY. UPON CHECKING THE Cigarette, I NOTICED
A FLAw NEAR THE FILTER. ITS NOT LIKE
ANY Cigarette I HAVE NEVER NOTICED.
NEED LESS TO SAY I DISCARDED THE PACK.
BUT DECIDED TO MAIL ONE TO YOU WITH
EVERY THING GOING ON THESE DAYS IT DOESNT
HURT To CHECK.

THANK you

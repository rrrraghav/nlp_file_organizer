I began saving Camel Cash because of the great free offers. I refuse to pay additional cost for something that should be a “bonus” item. Marlboro has nice free gifts w/Marlboro Miles + if the only Camel catalogs I get ask for money, I will switch. Your representative told me she would send me a different catalog w/free items and I have yet to see one. If I smoke 30-40 packs of cigarettes, why should I still have to pay $20 and 5 C-notes for a T-shirt? I do not like this new system.

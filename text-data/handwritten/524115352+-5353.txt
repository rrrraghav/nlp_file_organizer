To whom it may concern,

I’m asking for your help. I am thirty-six (36 years old) I have been smoking since I was eight. I’m not blaming you but I need help.
I tried eight or nine times to stop but I can’t. If there is anything you can do please notify me. It I don't hear from you in a couple weeks it means you don’t give a damn. I just traded my pen for another cigarette. I feel that you are my last resort. If I can’t get any assistance I may have to go public with my problem. As fruitless as this may be, I feel that I need to stop smoking anyway I can.

Thank you

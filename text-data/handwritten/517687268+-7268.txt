Hello Doral Jan 12 - 97

I have been wanting to write
you a long time but didn’t really
make times. I really enjoy smokers
my husband & I. Mom & my
husband will be 60 yrs in April
& have @@@ planned all grand but
we have been sending Doral you
many gifts & we enjoy them. We
really see the coupons & feel able
to order cartons of the state. It’s great.
Between us two, we buy 3 cartons a
week. I ordered the Christmas Village
& received it before christmas & it
was beautiful. I am real excited
about getting this radio. Thanks Doral
for all the wonderful things you have
for us smokers to enjoy getting in
addition to enjoying your cigarettes.

Thank Again

I must inquire about
previous deeds sent before
the 12/31/94 deadline.

My husband and myself
both panel our deals
and sent separate
70 sent amounts in
Oct and Dec of 1994.
Neither has been
received. We do appre-
ciate your helpful
cooperation, keep them
coming, thank you.
But, we would appreciate
receiving our returns
you sent in deeds for.

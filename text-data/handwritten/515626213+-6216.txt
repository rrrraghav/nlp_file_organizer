re: your letter of 4/28/86
Dear Arthur,

how are you? My name is Bill Cary and I’m
writing to answer your letter. I’m dropping
this message because I told you this was fine
if I knew what to expect when you hoped I
would look into a place or any that I have
& will be available including just in case for 4
or 5 people who need them & that I might not
be able to make it. The isn’t gettin’ material
on the lodge reservation with other I have
& that is advantage of what you offer your
discounts, coupons and others
& incentives programs so far about your
proposal that will continue omit
the thought through this & I’m aggreed
to do something to help you.

attempting to a rather serious matter

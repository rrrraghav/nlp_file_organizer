Dear Mr. Lowe,

I now smoke Camel regulars for years, like the dot fifty. I bought a carton of my cigarettes from the Eden Newsstand that Wednesday and found out how annoying regular if I put the cigarette down it an ash tray or ball it
goes out. If I re-light it and smoke half off on it
it goes out. How come? I never had that happen before,
if you people have a “filter” could this be Wallace did?
Will I’m writing to you because you don't have
Cigars for Camel regulars? You love to get Camel Filters
and what are filters, how come.

As for your Camels give me smoked 3-year old Camel
regulars for years, if you ever do want to do South Cayfe,
your Camel regulars as the best.



Sincerely yours,
Charles Myers Sr.

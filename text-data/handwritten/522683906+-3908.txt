Dear Pat,

In response to your letter in which you stated my catalogue request is being sent in about three or four weeks & in closing, your wording implied that I am a valued customer.

I’ve got to tell you, Pat, I do not feeling very valued by any company. As a matter of fact, Pat, I'm downright hurt. I'm very faithful to your product and I have to go thru A PROCESS taking now three-plus months just to get A catalague. It’s not unreasonable until a neighbor of mine received A pack of cigarettes in a tin box from you guys – Camel Turkish Gold. And I need to tell you Pat - this guy smokes MARLBORO. He smoked your pack you sent & then went right back to Marlboro. And he laughed at me! So, sure, I feel a little slighted. A little unappreciated and I thought I should convey to you my slight distress over this problem.

After considering my dilemma & con-cluded the only way to help me save face is to send me A pack of Turkish Gold in a nice little tin box along with a catalague, as well as something extra for my trouble that I can casually mention or useith Front

Dear Sirs,

I have been smoking regular Camel
filter cigarettes since I was
a teenager and I don't understand
why I can’t get C. notes with
my brand of Camels.

I am 48 years old and have
been smoking Camel - regular – for
30 years.

I think your catalogue
prices are way to high anyway
since it is advertisement for
you and cost more than you
could go out and buy in stores.
I would appreciate your writing
answer.



Yours,
Jerry Brookshier

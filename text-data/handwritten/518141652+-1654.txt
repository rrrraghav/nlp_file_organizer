Dear Sir,

I have sent enough pack seals for (1) Camera at different times and received one camera
and a piece of paper that said, "Due to Minnesota
State laws, we will not send the camera - which is
a contradiction since they had already sent one.
I also sent enough pack seals for three cartons
of cigarettes and received (2) notices that they
could not send them to me, as the state of Minnesota
prohibited sending them – and they ignored the
third order and kept all the seals.

I talked to a man in Fergus Falls, MN, who had
received 5 cartons of cigarettes with his pack seals.
Fergus Falls is a town that is 18 miles away from
us - also in Minnesota.



And now, I called about a month ago – 1-800-
74-DORAL about 10 pack seals to get an
order form for a free carton, which I expected
the list of date was December 31st. I was
told they couldn’t possibly send the order form to
me so I could send the seals in left like
dead line. This is ridiculous! The woman

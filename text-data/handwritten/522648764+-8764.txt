Some times I do not have wrapping for some of the
right gifts
I would use the sunday
comic paper to wrap the
the gift then they can
read them

Also I take red felt then
cut it to sit with red
stocking or fill it with
hard candy or little
candy cane

also I would like to know
where I could buy those
pocket ashtray
they are neat when there
no ashtray around

Thank you

Dear firmados:

It is writing to thank you for
the coupons and strongly urge you
to send more as I use them so
often & any whenever I can perservere
to buy folir.

I also wish to regard what
was I want when your calling stated
in your ad that say that “we’re
paint offers are coming in future
mailing… What are those and how
best if I may take advantage of
them?

Please let me know as
soon as possible,

Thanks &
berbalindly

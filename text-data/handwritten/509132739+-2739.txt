"Smoking.
Here's
what I’m
doing
about it."

“I like the taste of a good cigarette
and I don’t intend to settle for less.
But I want to know what’s being said
so I began searching for
a cigarette that could give
me the taste I like with less tar.
I found Vantage. A cigarette that
really gives a lot of taste and with
much less tar than what I'd
smoked before.”

What am I doing about smoking?
I’m smoking Vantage.

RE: carbon differences on TPP Date: Dec 5, 1988
perhaps to do with delivering?

Overview

As a parts of the menthol delivery task
force investigations & general practice it was decided
that perhaps differences in the carbon on the
TPP were a contributing factor in the menthol delivery. Data pointing
to this conclusion were as follows obtained
from 0.166mg Remote menthol (SM) and 0.739 SM
plugs and are included in appendix 1. Therefore,
in this study two experiments were conducted
in an attempt to understand whether or not the
carbons from the low and high plugs were different.

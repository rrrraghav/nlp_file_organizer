RJR Nabisco,

I am one of many Americans
now boycotting your products.
Your Camel "smooth move"
ads are extremely offensive,
especially #334 which has
been dubbed “Beach Rape.”
On top of marketing a lethal
product to minors, how you’re
condoning rape. I've never
had much faith in large
corporations, but this is
unconscionable.

A former consumer
of your products,
Katherine Johnson
809 East Front #2
Missoula, MT
59802

P.S. some of your products
I bought before and won’t anymore:
oreos, ortega products, graham crackers
fig newtons etc.
premium saltines
cream of wheat
shredded wheat
mister salty pretzels
ritz crackers
reynold's wrap
junior mints

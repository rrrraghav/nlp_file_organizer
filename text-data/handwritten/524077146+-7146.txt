Gentlemen:

I smoke Dorat Ultra lights all the time and
I purchase them by the carton. I usually buy
at least one carton per week and have never
ever had any problem (until now). I’m enclosing
a package that I purchased this week from my
local Wal-Mart. I believe I open 3-4 packages
and all was ok, however, when I opened this
package, I immediately noticed that the filter
on two of the cigarettes were stained and looked
darker than the is others in that package. You
might want to put them in with a new package and
see what I mean. I was afraid to smoke them and
thought I should send them on to you to see what
it is. Would appreciate a response.

Sincerely,

Mr. Arleen B. Asledge

To whomever it may concern;
I would really appreciate it
if you could send me the current
Camel Cash Catalog. I’ve been
saving Camel Cash for a little over
a year now, and would hate to think
that it was all for nothing.
My friends are suggesting that
I switch to Marlboro so that I can
at least turn in the Marlboro Miles
to get stuff. If I can get a Camel
Cash Catalog soon so that I can use
my Camel Cash, then I will stick to the
Camel Filters that I’ve been smoking for
the last twelve years. It may I may
take my friends advice. I hope to
hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

John M. Egan

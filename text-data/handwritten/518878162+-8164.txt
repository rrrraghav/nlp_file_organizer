I. Precision: Moments
a) % based
b) Geometric
c) Geomettric

II. Prep for Grammetric Analysis
a) Compared syringe (gertight) vs micro-pipette for accuracy &
precision @ delivering volumes (100µl 500µl) & 165 Buffer.
1) Micro- pipette was better/more accurate during
volume delivered more delivery.
B) Compared various volumes (100, 500, 1000µl)
1) Initial delivery assessed - Micr 5 vs. pipetter –
grammetric data.  –  identifi where was a signi-
difference in volume delivery (grammetric data).
(a) Repeated Pipette Deliveries
(b) Other cleaned & repeated process. (3/6/95)
2) Determined that volume delivered was different between
pipetter & Micr 5.
(a) Regressed (Figures) mass vs volume for manuald
MES.
(b) Adjusted MES settings

3) Series 2 grammetric comparison pipetter vs. Micr 5.
a) 100, 500, 800, & 1000µl – numbers vs MES - signifi different
b) Precision was “not” good for all grades of the batch P.C.K.

(c) Mass vs micro (pipette) vs mass (MES) regressions

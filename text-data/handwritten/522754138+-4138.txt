Gentlemen:

My wife and I have been smoking regular Camels (non-filter) for over fifty years. We are in our seventies.

We just received your promotional packet and feel that your are discriminating against people who smoke non-filtered camels as there are no C-notes in their packs. This makes it impossible for us to participate in your promotion.

The cost of Camel regular (non-filter) is higher than the cost of filtered Camels. Why is the cost higher? You have always stated on the pack of regular Camels that the cost of the tobacco in Camels prohibits the use of premiums or coupons. Does that mean that you use inferior tobacco in filtered Camels and you can afford to give premiums with them?

I would appreciate an explanation and an answer to this letter.

Sincerely,
Sam Arcidiacono

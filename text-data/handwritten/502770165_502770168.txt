RE: BRAND FAMILY IN-DEPTHS

BACKGROUND
The Overall Objective Of This Project Is To Assess How Best To SEGMENT The Cigarette MARKET, As An Initial Step. It Was Felt That AN IMPROVEMENT Was Necessary In Our UNDERSTANDING OF Brand Families. Thus, A SERIES OF IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

FINDINGS

•	IT HAS BECOME APPARENT TO ME THAT CONSUMERS TALKED ABOUT THE BENEFITS Of CIGARETTES IN ROUGHLY THESE WAYS:
    PRODUCT BENEFITS: low tar, relaxing, satisfying
    USER BENEFITS: masculine, feminine, macho
    PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS: gets wire off back, makes me feel better, MAKES me A PART OF THE GROUP.

EVERY Cigarette Has SOME Of EACH Of The Above BENEFITS IT IS THE PROPORTION OF THIS BENEFIT PROVIDED BY THE BRAND WHICH CHANGES. ATTACHED Is A MAP WHICH REPRESENTS MY HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE BENEFITS Provided By Some MAJOR Brands.

THE SHORTCOMING OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN BRANDS Providing The Same Type Of BENEFIT WITH DIFFERENT IMAGES (Marlboro & Virginia Slims).

•	THE STRUCTURE OF THE MARKET VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN OLDER AND YOUNGER SMOKERS:
    OLDER Smokers  PREF BRAND   OLD FASHIONED
                                LUCKY STRIKE   Home Rows
    YOUNGER Smokers MARLBORO      Lucky Strikes

Dear Salem Crew -

I haven't received anything but Salem’s for over thirty years. My daughter also has borrowed Salem’s for twenty years. We were on your mailing list at one time but haven’t received any promotional deals or coupons for over a year. We wondered why we were removed from your mailing list. We still buy Salems and Dominios. Somebody gave us a coupon as two $1 deal's. I wanted to get new customer deal. I think you should not forget your faithful smokers. We would like to be back on your mailing list.

Sincerely
Jeanette Domasciento

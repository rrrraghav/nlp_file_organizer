Dear Sirs-

I’ve been smoking Vantage
for 9 years, and although I’ve
tried other low-tar cigarettes,
I’ve always come back to Van-
tage, and I guess I'll stay
with them until I finally
manage to quit. However, I
recently bought a carton that
must have gone through the
assembly line on a Monday.
The inspector was either
absent or hung over. Every
pack had 2 or 3 cigarettes with
a defect- like the filters weren’t
glued on, the seams were half
open, or the papers looked like
they'd been through a sewing
machine.

I appreciate your efforts
to help me cut down, but I
would like to get what I pay
for-
Thanks,
Betsy Broome, P.O. Box 704, zebula

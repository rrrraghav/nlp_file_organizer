Dear Camel Co., 1-25-98

I have been smoking Camels
for about 15 years.
I have never even received
any free things or even coupons
for Camels.
A friend of mine don't even
smoke Camel, and he receives
things from Camel all the time
Why is this?
I will still keep smoking
Camel.
My Grandpa & Dad smoked
them, so you see Camel has
been with my family for a
long time, it’s like a close
family.
Thank you for your time

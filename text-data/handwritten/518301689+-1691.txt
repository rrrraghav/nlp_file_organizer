Dear Sirs:

I have been purchasing Century Light
100 ever since they were put on the market.
As I in the past few months I’ve
noticed that the cigarettes almost smoke
themselves out because they burn quickly.
Dates noticed how the last part tends to
fall off (causing burns on rugs, chairs, etc.).

I rarely write letters to the manufacture
of my favorite products but I'm somewhat
disappointed in this product lately.
Please respond to my complaint.

Sincerely,
(Mrs.) J. Wright

P.S. I usually buy them
travel custom-ized in tone!

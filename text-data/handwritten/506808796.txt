OBJECT: To assess whether commercially available control equip-
ment is capable of providing acceptable air quality in
lieu of implementing smoking restrictions!
System performance.

Define operation and maintenance domain for
evaln. Assesses representativeness of position in market
for Smokerter. [Provides avenue for generalizing
from results]

System performance will depend on:
(a) EVS level Factors are interde-
(b) System O&M pendent
(c) HVAC system performance

e.g., (a) “ETS” level Available
i) time of day ETS Indicators
ii) number of occupants Nicotine (Nic)
iii) number of smokers RSP
iv) demographics UPM
v) time of year/week FPM
vi) type of cigarettes 3YP
vii) ACH [air changes/hour] CO
viii) human activity -CO2
ix) outdoor level of CO, RSP,...
x) Volume of Space ETS Predictors
xi) air mixing # occupants/m³
xii) microenvironmental # cigarettes/m³/h
inhomogeneities ACH/CO[ventilation]
xiii) indoor sources of CO, Correlations between

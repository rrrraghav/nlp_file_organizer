Dear Doris, Oct 9, 1999

About 5 or 6 months ago I started
my board of cigarettes from marketing right
to Louisiana. I have been a smoker for
approx. 10 years and realized that Louisiana
are the best cigarettes. But I had to drive
to the store and bought & cartons and when
I opened them, they were stale! I tried to
return them but didn’t have my receipt, so
I can't even return to. I was very
disappointed because cigarettes are so
expensive and I had to just throw them
away. Needless to say - I stopped buying
cigarettes in that store. Find just wanted
to let someone know so this doesn’t happen
to anyone else.

Thank you,
Lisa Taylor

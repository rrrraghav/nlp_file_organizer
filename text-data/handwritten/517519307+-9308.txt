Camel Co.

I have Smoked Camel regulars for
35 years. Now you keep sending me
Ads for Catalogs, Where I can get
things for Camel Cash. You don't put
Camel Cash on my brand. Do you
think that is fair? I don’t. If I had
been Saving Camel Cash for 35 years
at 4 Cartons per month figure out how
many I would have Saved. I could
have Cleaned out your Catalog by now.

Yours

1997 Opportunistic Programs

Background

As part of the 1997 pre-planning process we are suggesting year attractive identifying potential opportunistic program needs within Yuar Region. We are looking for opportunities that have not generally covered biz, standard well-plan programs (ie. March Gas, Sturgis, Bike week, The Camel Beach program, etc.). In addition, we need your input relative to promotional needs to support SME events within Yuar region.

Opportunistic Programs
When identifying potential opportunistic programs it is important to keep the following points in mind:
1. As previously stated, our #1 promotional objective for 1997 will be to flawlessly execute and maximize the business building potential of the base plan.
2. Currently, the 1997 Base Plan consists of the following:
    * 1 national monthly promotion on Camel and no national promotions for April/June will be no monthly partner promotions in 1997. There are currently 4 to 6 Winston promotions planned for SSA and Houston that will likely be worked on top of the base plan.
    * Eclipse markets will have 3 promotions which will be worked on top of the base plan.
    * Camel, Mental and/or Salem opposition market will each have 1 promotion that will be worked on Top of the base plan.

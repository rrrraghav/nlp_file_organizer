Dear Camel,

I used to smoke Marlboro
Brand cigarettes... but I just quit
on 5/25/69 and started smoking camel
brand on 5/26/69. And I was wanting
more information about camel brands
cash catalog. And I want to receive
offers, premiums, coupons, and or free
cigarettes that may be sent to me in
the mail. Also I would like to become
a VIP member.

Thank you
Raymond F. Barrios II

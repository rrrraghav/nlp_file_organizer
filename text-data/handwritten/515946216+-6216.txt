To Whom it May Concern:

These are just a
sample of what's
been happening to my
cigarettes when I take
one out to smoke.
They pull apart at
the filter.

I had torn a fine
pack out of ten (carton)
doing this.
I thought you might
want to know what’s
happening at today prices
you can't afford to throw
cigarettes away, Thank
Sue Rhoads

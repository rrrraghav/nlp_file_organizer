I, have a curious Question? for you all.
(let me add) that I’m also a famed “Camel”
Smoker For some years now, My Question is:
I happen to notice while I was Relaxing -
Smoking A Regular Camel Filter – Cigaretton Box
Cartoon. I glanced at the cigarette for some-
Reason or another?, I saw the word CAMEL,
Printed on the Cigarette instead of the “Figure-
it self.” I found that print, CAMEL (instead
of the Figure Logo.) to be "Very Prestigious," in it’s -
own “pretension”. Any-how, what my Question is:
I have not Been able to Find anymore printed
like such and was Curious to what it might have
been. A promotional, or not, I would simply just
love to know if possible, what happen and or
if this style is still available and if so, where?
again I know its just a printed word “CAMEL”
but, I happen for Style of Print instead of "Logo Figure".
Please Answer my curious Question" And Have A Good-
Day! Thank you, very much.

Sincerely, 
[Signature]
All Cam

To Watson & May Coxeerr:

I have been a dedicated Winston
for 22 years. Now, it’s strictly “Select”
cigarettes for me. (Jam 40). The other
day, I thought my usual carton - per pack.
The first pack that I opened was a little
stalk. Then – the second pack. Well, I’m
enclosing a cigarette for you to see. The
entire pack was like this one. When I'd
light up, it appeared that the filter wasn’t
simply tightly attached since smoke escaped
around the fitter.

I’ve save the select coupons and have
not been able to locate a catalog. Will you
please send me one? I would appreciate it.



Thank you

Pam Clay

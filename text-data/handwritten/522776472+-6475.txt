K.J. Reynolds,
I am writing to answer a question. I have been smoked Selen 1866 for 9 yrs.
And my husband has been smoking Selen
cigarettes since he was 14 years old. They
are 39 yrs. He has smoked. The first kind
of cig. I smoked Marlboro’s for
about 10 yrs before I started smoking
the Selen 1866. I had all kinds of health
problems especially from Cancer & Bronchitis
So I quit smoked. The Marlboro 100's and
my husband will take them always tells anyone
who smoked. They should quitted when
they were smoking cigarettes. He Selen’s hired
& had some kind of Marlboro that didn’t
but want a good smoke, so I decided to quit
the Selens. A few weeks & my job & did
my doctor stopped. So we did the routine
trouble with an amount of change for
Selenttobes & for last year. Angel Selen is
to live. And apart on my lung then the
Doctor said. Have come from my cigarette
Smoking. Six months after I’d started smoke

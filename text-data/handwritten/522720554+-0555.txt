To whom it may concern:

You have a fine
product but you must
say something about the
high prices retailers are
passing on to their customers.
No two stores have the
same prices which tells
me there is a giant
rip-off to the consumer
and if the Movement can
stick their big nose in
and allow stupid lawsute
then they should stick
into they outrageous prices
being charged!

Sincerely,

Charlie Parker Jr

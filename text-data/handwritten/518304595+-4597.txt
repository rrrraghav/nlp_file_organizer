Dear Mr. Uhlmann:

Thank you for your interest in our company, Camel cigarettes, and promotions.

Tobacco companies use a number of different marketing strategies to help promote their brands. They vary from time to time -- and most of these are only temporary promotions.

Our special promotions are randomly selected from list of names of smokers who have either participated in tobacco company’s promotions or possibly completed a survey indicating they are a smoker 21 years of age or older.

If you would like your name added to our mail list please complete the enclosed card and drop it in the mail (postage is already paid). It is very important that you fill in ALL requested information on the card and sign your name to it.

When the completed card is received your name will be on our list and make you eligible to receive periodic mailings during the year related to our product that you use. These mailings are sent out on a random selected basis.

Mr. Uhlmann, we thank you for contacting us and hope you will accept the enclosed coupons to use towards your next purchases. Best wishes from all of us at Reynolds.

Sincerely,



H. Matthews 27,75

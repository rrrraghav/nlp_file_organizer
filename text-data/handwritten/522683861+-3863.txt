To Whom at May Concern:

I am writing this letter
because I feel I have been
cheated by purchasing Winstor
Cigarettes! Not only did I
not get the "W" from the
packs, I also paid taxes
on 5 cartons that were
for use outside the U.S.
I always purchase Winstor
cigarettes / time per month
5® cartons” and I save
the “Ws” for future Cigarette
offers. I will Continue to
purchase Winstor I just
needed to inform you, this
is new reporting to me, especially
since this are so expensive
and to close the Ws too.

Thank You

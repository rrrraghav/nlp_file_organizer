Sir,
I’ve been worried about my
daughter since Feb. 91. She has
been married for 17 years and
loved her husband very much, and
he took her pen death in Jan. He
raped their own daughter. They
haven't gotten over it. It gets me about
daughter so taking. Considering I hope
it will help, but she said was a
daddy’s girl and loved her daddy.
I just pray it won’t come back you life.
She is 14 years old. She is in person.
My daughter when she was a year
old she had a temperature for 6 months
the doctor at Baptist hospital told me-
because of this she would have a
education when she grow up. I need
her to understand how to do things
and pay bills or it’s gonna burn of &
want enough money to pay them all.
I also sent her to school than 7th
grade. She is a good manager she
is 38 years old. The only work or job she
could get was cleaning trailers

Dear Sir or Madam,

After finding this cigarette in
my pack of New menthol 10’s, I
question the “Class A” that appears
at -the top of the package.

I enjoy the taste of your low
tar/nicotine cigarette but can't
help wondering if the mislead is
an attempt to help me smoke
even less.

Sincerely,

Mrs. Kay Dorazio

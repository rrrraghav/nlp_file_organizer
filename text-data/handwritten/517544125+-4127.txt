Dear Village Makers,

We have enjoyed our village so much this Holiday Season. To tell the truth our village has been set up since its arrival in October. We received compliments from everyone who saw it. My Daddy thought it was really special since he liked his father, and his father & his father before him have been tobacco farmers.  & later live on a tobacco farm. Can you tell me if anymore villages are available? Do you have plans to expand the village? I look very interested in possibly enlarging my tobacoville. Thank you !

Yours truly,

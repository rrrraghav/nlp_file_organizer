IDEAS

I. Use a larger diameter flue - secure
then now used in Fe-3. This will
deliver more puff. (Also easier to fill
capsule.)

II. Are there other aerosol formers?
- one which might form at higher
temperature and thereby be better
at extracting nicotine.
- Poly Glycols

III. Roll filter and tobacco on a regular
cigarette maker … then combine
with piper glass wrapped fuel source
or play - tube combiner
- advantage – could use conventional
handling and making equipment.
One wrap



IV. Tobacco heated to 200°C for there could be
used as an inert filler, if it were placed
so it could not combust.

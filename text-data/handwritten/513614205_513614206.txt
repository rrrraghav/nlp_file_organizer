IS THE GOVERNMENT
GOING TOO FAR?

Believe it or not, there’s a possibility that you may not be permitted to smoke in your truck or car even if you are alone.
The time has come to say “enough”. The time has come to allow adults in this country to make their own decisions of their own free will, without government control or intervention.

It is this undue interference that gets us to government ban. If this sounds unlikely, consider the following:
The government is currently proposing to ban smoking in any building being entered regularly by ten or more people at least once a week (which includes just about everyone) designate the area/building as specifically ventilated and separately exhausted area.
Obviously, this regulation for smoking is provided and will apply to every restaurant and bar in America but that's not all.
Government regulation could also affect your home. Your right to smoke in your home could be curtailed present a delivery person or a service call at any time.

Private vehicles could also be affected if you are a trucker.

This opinion is brought to you in the interests of an informed debate by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We believe the solution to most smoking issues can be found in accommodation and understanding ways in which smokers and non-smokers can coexist peacefully. And we encourage age dialogue and discussion that will help solve the issues without the government plus calling 1.800.396.6441.

TOGETHER, WE CAN WORK IT OUT
YOU CAN’T TELL THE TRUTH -

I support this.

people that are not being told.
Because you
can't tell the Truth.

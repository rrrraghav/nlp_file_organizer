5. FILTRATION EFFICIENCY

Percy D. Phillips

SUMMARY: DATA GENERATED HAS INDICATED THAT SEVERAL FACTORS ARE
HERE INVOLVED IN INFLUENCING FILTRATION EFFICIENCY. THESE FACTORS ARE:
SMOKE VELOCITY, DENIER PERFILAMENT - TOTAL DENIER, FILAMENT SURFACE AREA,
AND SURFACE AREA OF COMMON TOW ITEMS. THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF SMOKE
PARTICULATE FILTRATION OCCUR PRIMARILY BY THREE MECHANISMS:
DIRECT INTERCEPTION, BROWNIAN DIFFUSION, AND INERTIAL IMPACTION.
RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT DIFFUSION ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY
TWO-THIRDS OF PARTICULATE FILTRATION, WHILE DIRECT INTERCEPTION
ACCOUNTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINDER OF FILTRATION./
INERTIAL IMPACT ION HAS BEEN REPORTED TO PLAY A VERY MINOR ROLE,
ACCOUNTING FOR LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF FILTRATION.

STUDIES RELATING SMOKE VELOCITY TO FILTRATION EFFICIENCY HAVE
APPROACHED THIS AREA FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT ANGLES. EXPERIMENTS
INVOLVING VARYING PUFF DURATIONS AND HOLD VOLUME CONSTANT AND
EXPERIMENTS WHERE PUFF VOLUMES WERE VARIED HOLDING PUFF DURATION
CONSTANT (BOTH OF WHICH ESSENTIALLY LOWERING SMOKE VELOCITY) HAVE
INDICATED THAT AS THE VELOCITY OF SMOKE PASSING THROUGH THE
CIGARETTE IS LOWERED THEN FILTRATION EFFICIENCY IS INCREASED. IN
THESE STUDIES FIBER ORIENTATION WAS FOUND TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE
DEGREE OF INCREASED EFFICIENCY. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE USE OF
VENTED FILTERS TO LOWER THE AND NO SMOKE DELIVERY STUDIES WERE
INITIATED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT THAT AIR DILUTION ON FILTER
PERFORMANCE. HIGH AIR DILUTION WAS FOUND TO INCREASE FILTRATION
EFFICIENCY BY LOWERING SMOKE VELOCITY. INCREASING THE SMOKE VELOCITY
CAN INCREASE FILTRATION BY DIFFUSION, BY INCREASING THE LENGTH
OF TIME THAT PARTICULATES ARE AVAILABLE FOR DIFFUSION TO OCCUR.

Denier Per Filament (DPF), TOTAL DENIER CORRELATES WITH
THE SIZE, WEIGHT, AND DISTRIBUITION OF INDIVIDUAL FILTER FIBERS.
THE EFFICIENCY OF A FILTER HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE DEPENDENT
ON THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF ITS MATERIAL. LOW DP FILTERS
(SMALL INDIVIDUAL FIBERS) HAVE HIGHER NATE VALUE AND ESSENTIALLY
MORE DENIER THAN THE AVERAGE CHOSEN DPF THEREFORE ARE HIGHLY
EFFICIENT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL
FIBERS CAUSING MORE SURFACE AREA FOR DIRECT INTERCEPTION.

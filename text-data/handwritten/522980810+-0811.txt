PM
horilland agree well with Nic

PM - CO
Differ in SS Tan - we use spectrophotometric

PM
horilland used vicotine.

We may be slightly inflating the chimney factor,
others making a different assumption of
ratio of Nic

-> pH 6.92.

Convergence down ~ 310 or 325

Ask art if he has absorbance data back for 380nm

Should be described - Maybe in the principle
of measurement
SS Smoke collection is difficult
we are really comparing extraction conditions
and not product differences.

380 compare with absorbance
360 we would get with Nic
300 Nic determination of chimney

Dear One,

I have been a steady customer
for many years. However you totally
lost me. When I received the last
catalog, I started seeing deals for the
#12 Radio Offer. I finally ordered
35 seals which consisted of 1 carton
a week. Now it is not available!
We you have to be a chair person to
receive your offers? I rated this is one
one of your shows for the public
to tell you. It doesn’t show your
approciation for our business.
From now on can't me out as a
loyal customer! Very disappointed!!
Happy New Year!

Hoping you well Receive many more
letters of complaints from concerned
customers,

Red Travel to the U.S. of Dr. Hoffmann and Dr. Klaus -Mittmanns)
& Preston Wattham, Thermoelectron Company (Jan 1978)
Participant of the conversation: Dr. Gordon Edwards (Director of the Cancer Research Center)
General impression about the laboratory: a small labratory,
equipped only for nitrosamine analysis. The coupling of the
thermoelectron analyzer is the same as in Vienna, & the
pyrolysis oven is placed directly above the GLC (Variam
1400) detector.
Dr. Fine will not present (analyses nitrosamines in the environment)
1. Analysis of nitrosamines in tissue samples (“whole
mouse”) according to Edwards:
About 150g sample is placed in liquid nitrogen, homogenis-
added 1µg/ml (?). ascorbic acid and 1µg/ml α-tocopherol (indicates
an artificial nitrosamine formation in the pyrolysis system)
transferred to a 250 ml flask and added 30 ml paraffin oil
& 4 ml water. The flask is equipped with a thermo-
meter and condenser and the distillation is conducted
at 105°C and 2 Torr over a period of about 35 min. The
distillate is collected in a cold trap at about -80°C. All
volatile (i) nitrosamines within the range of dimethyl-
nitrosamine and morpholine nitrosamine distilled over.
The distillate (50 ml) is placed in a pre-packed “open
cellulose, impregnated by microemulsions”, allowed to stand
for 10 min. and the nitrosamines eluted with 20ml Et₂O
the eluate is concentrated to a residue: Dimethyl piperazin
and concentrate to 0.5 ml & 0.1 ml indocane is added
to the distillate (both as “keeper” and then analyzed

Dear Doral Boss,

For the last year I have been trying to get Doral to send me a order form so I called around some stuff, & Maya line even called a few times. & don’t even believe I have put on the mailing list. 
Cause nothing has come to my new address!
Stuff was still going to my old address which was to Mary Davis - PO Box 66 – Harrell, Mo. 63945.
And even when all they did send was a form for a free carton, Dee 70 seals that’s a lot of smokes for a free carton. I would much rather be pleased if they sent one a form where I can order stuff that could be more useful, something I can show my friends. I am happy with the flavor of Doral.
I was borned March 23, 1953. Adult Child is 26. Any way clue been smoking a goodmany years. I have ordered a few things with my dealear in the past.
They ordered in the past a fancy table lighter with ash tray & pocket lighter, and few pieces of clothing which I ended up giving away cause they were made more for a man’s figure, which is unfair! They should have jackets made for a big woman in 2 L x size and long enough to cover the back hind end. I also ordered that handmarrch which she never got me, cause of refuse to put it up outside to get weather ruined. I'll still want her so I can sit up with a knitted for that warmings as we come into winters day.
I have also got one of them folding chairs thing room. 
I will try to find out who is in charge & get it sent again till then, I’m just feelin’ frustrated. I would like to see that big khaki trousers that they used to have for some time ago.

Dear James W. Johnston,

I think what you’re trying to
do is very wrong. We are very proud
of the Dakotas, and if people really
like the Dakotas, they might think the
cigarettes are good for them and they
are not! The Dakotas have fresh air,
beautiful scenery and wonderful tourist
attractions. We don’t want cigarettes
named after the Dakotas because cig-
arettes kill. Please don't name a
cigarette after something very good.
Please consider changing the name.

Sincerely,

Angie Postal

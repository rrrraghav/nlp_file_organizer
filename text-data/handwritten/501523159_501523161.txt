Re: Discussion of the animal experiments w. th coumarin
by BIBRA and Dr. Brune at VDC on mar25/82
part. participants: Dr. Adlerhofer Dr. Roe

Dr. Evelyn Schroeder

1. Comparison of the liver sections of animal experiment conducted by Griepentrog, BIBRA and Dr. Brune
Dr. Roe had the opportunity to examine the Brune cuts from the BIBRA and Griepentrog experiment. His assessment had been summarized in a brief report (distrib-uted) After considering the known results so far (no metatization, partial reversibility), he came to the conclusion that the tumors are apparently not malignant. According to the statement of Dr. Roe, the liver cuts of the Brune experiment (group 1C, fed with 5400ppm coumarin for 6 months) indicated exactly the same changes as the preparations from the BIBRA studies (5000ppm coumarin for 9 months) and Griepentrog experiments.

2. The participants of the discussion agreed unanimously that the equality of the histological transformations in the three studios makes a search for experimentally conditioned differences maximal treatment superfluous. The Brune experiment will be conducted in the planned manner, since important information is expected in regards dose-effect relation and reversibility.

Re: These are two questions in the foreground:
a) Are the observed transformations malignant tumors?
To clarify this question, it is necessary to conduct following studies: search for metastases in other organ

WELL ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WET
TO A SHIV SERVICE STATION TO ORDER my
Regular Cig which was The Winston /
Long Regular, The Attendor told
me HE WAS OUT AT TIME SO I LOOK

Shocked at THE TASTE of That cig

was much more courser Smokier
I LOVE THE Dorale Cig OF All The
cigs on THE market today, Thanks
FOR THE RECOGNITION of DORALS,

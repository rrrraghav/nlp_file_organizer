To whom it may concern:

I have smoked your brand of cigarettes
(Winston & 100's) for many years now, he well
be my wife. Recently I bought I carton of
cigarettes & my son Barton opened that pack from both
in over half of the cigarettes. I returned them
to the store from which I purchased them
& they would not make good or exchange them.
I just thought you'd like to know.

Thank you

1. Probably the taste of many things would change vary decidedly over a pH 5-8 range - Morrell should have interesting comments.
2. If change in this case is attributed to in some substantial measure, to greater impact as pH increases – then it is interesting to compare the amount of nicotine absorbed at pH7 vs pH8 from a puff (Camel LT, Merit) form a cigarette at high moisture and these values vs absorbed nicotine from a puff of smoke at the moisture (cigarette red moistness).  I have done this quickly so don’t base your life on the accuracy of the data – but they should be close.)

mg Moisture/puff at 10% Moisture (Camel LT) = 0.12
128% = 0.10
Assume 15% moisture absorption at pH7, 20% @pH8

(1) at pH7 & 128% Moisture absorption” = 0.10 x 15%= .015 mg
“pH8.” = 0.10 x 20%= .020 “
“pH7.” 10% “ = 0.12 x 15%= .018 ”

Merit

at pH7 & 137% Moisture, "absorption" = .076 x 15%= .011
“pH8.” = .076 x 20%= .015
“pH7.” 7% “ = .094 x 15%= .014
“pH1 & 10%” = .084 x 15%= .013

There seems to be quite a fair amount of information around pointing to the harshness of nicotine, which a harshness that can become accounted for by several factors – pH, unbalanced T/N, low moisture, combinations of these. My guess is that pH is the least of these evils.

Dear Sir,

I’ve smoked nothing but Camel for thirty-nine
years. I’ve filled out every thing I’ve got
through mail & protested the tobacco company's
against communism. We never received
any free coupons on Camel. Marlboro,
Salem and others. You get coupons on.
I called Louisville, Ky and got three
coupons, one dollar off carton one
time. How do you get this.

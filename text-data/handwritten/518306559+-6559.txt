Dear Camel Cash:

I have been a constant CAMEL regular smoker since June of 1960, at that time my ship’s commissary ran out of PHIL MAHR'S and I have smoked no other brand but CAMEL with any regularity. Now my problem!
I am holding your CAMEL CASH catalog six, with all it’s wonderful gifts and I am exempt. I cannot accumulate any C-NOTES because I am not a filter cigarette smoker.

I ask you, where is the fairness in all this? Why is there no provision for all of us loyal CAMEL smokers who have been with you for literally decades but just don't like filters?
Please consider my letter whether you do anything about it or not. And I will still smoke CAMEL because that puts me proud my choice out of all the brands on the cigarette market.

Thank you

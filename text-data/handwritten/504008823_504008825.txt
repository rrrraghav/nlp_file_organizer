Estimation of Pilot Plant throughput for
SSS production. This is for scheduled implementation
on 6-18-82

Background: SSS pilot plant shreds stems at a present
moisture of 55% ± 5%. Stems (shredded) are then
dried from 55% ± 5% to 20% ± 2%. We are
presently utilizing an A&D dryer (#5424) in the
pilot plant to achieve the drying desired. Pilot Plant
is still under construction, therefore the A&D has not
been tested yet.

Dear 8th,

I just wanted to write you and
express my opinion about something I
enjoyed at the Southern 500 Race
yesterday and that was
how the crowd was. It was
a sight to behold. There
was nothing in Wallace’s Grand-
standing of the drivers. Some of
the fast crew members in front of
the stands sitting up and waving at
the fans. Everyone was having a
good time and cheering most of
the race we could get with the
crowd so much actually helped. But
we must have gotten to good at
cheering them on. Winston Bay officials
same and stopped them. Why?
It seems likely you are not
officials would appreciate their
men, they didn’t have to
do this land get well

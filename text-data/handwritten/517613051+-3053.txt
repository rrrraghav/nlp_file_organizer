Dear R.J. Reynolds,

Finally I have found a brand of cigarettes I can call my own! I recently tried More Menthol - I know you’ll think I’m silly, but the reason I think them is because the slender, brown cigarette looked great with my new Armani scarf suit - but the reason I decided to stay with them is that I really enjoy the flavor. I am a smoker because I truly enjoy smoking, and as a mature adult I feel it is my decision, but until now I never had a “regular” brand. I find both the flavor & the look of More to be unique. Do you ever have Coupon promo’s? Could you put me on your mailing list? I attest that I am a smoker, over 21 years of age, and would like to receive coupons and mailings from you. Casey S. O'Sullivan

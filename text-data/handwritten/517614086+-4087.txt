So whom it may concerne,

I am 70 years old, or young.
Have been smoking (Vantage)
since you started making them?

I have spent a small fortune on
them. Better big than boy. I’ve
tried them all!

(But) these not cheap and
need (Coupons) for them.
Why don't you include a letter?
(Giving one a trial, send some
(Coupons) and that you can
afford it. 

Thank you.

Dear & Darol

I am writing to you as this if you could send Please send me some curtain to me, as it has been long time since I have written to your for some curtain. So cover You have told me once before You would be more glad to send me some curtain to me and there never did send any curtain to me at all, but earlier I have been working with Post office and they have told me they said Have not see anything from you at all. Also I have been asking my mail men he have told me he still have not see anything from you at all, because I have been speaking Darol for long time. We count every time when I go to the store to buy curtain of Darol They keep on going up & up. It covers that can not feel to pay high prices for them at all, as even I need do save money on this. That why I am writing to you ask You could send Your Please send me some curtain to me, but earlier I think do meet some from you. I think You’ll find You have time out to find this if you have any question about this. Please let me know

once again
I think love

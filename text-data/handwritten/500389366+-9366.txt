Dear Sir

I am a just another of your new food cig. order
and a lot of people who
have switched to Food -
God find that they come
very fast at the time &
also our break doing store.
But one thing is and
a lot of people that
think the smoke now are
wondering why they aren’t
in a regular cig. package
rather than the box?

We all find this for
inconvenient, so there
a reason why they couldn't
be in a package. Yours

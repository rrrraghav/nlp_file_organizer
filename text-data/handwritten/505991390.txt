Pressness Report 7-6-87

Work has been started on a paper coating apparatus which
will contruously coat rolling paper with a misted colloidal
surface and calcium carbonate.

Two modified “Camel Park titles” were given to
L. dePruce. Parts have been produced to modify &
more to test with a clean flame.

Work continues on optimizing a coating for paper to
be used in the hundred model.

Weekly Status

• Kimberly-Clark has submitted four bobbins
of 16-2 paper (contiu wrap) with two modifications
for reducing the dark ash with US-4 and WS-5
water soluble flavors. Front-end pieces have
been made for testing the papier with flavored
and unflavored inner wrap paper.

• As requested by KC, nearly 1 gallon of WS-5
water soluble flavor concentrate was submitted
to them for tasting on the 16-2 calendared paper.

• These casing flavors from Bell allowed no improvement
in another quality when tested on the fiberglass.

• We were unsuccessful in the laboratory this week
to convert the #28 alcohol base flavor to a
water soluble system.

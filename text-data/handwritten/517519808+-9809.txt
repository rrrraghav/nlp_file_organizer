Camel -
I purchased this pack OF
Camel Lighters today, Excited to
See Free lighters OFFER TO
My disappointment the offer was
Expired This also makes me
wonder Just How old is the pack
OF Cigarettes? I purchased them at
the EAGLE Grocery STORE IN
Lindenhurst IL. IF by Chance there
Any lighters left would you please
be so kind as to Send me one. Also
I'd like to know how old the Cigars
and Why Eagle sells them with
an Expired offer.

Dear Sir:

I usually purchase two
cartons of Winstons Ultra Light
100’s every week.

This is my favourite cigarret
and the only one that I can
smoke that doesn't bother me.

I have emphsema and any-
thing stronger really bothers
my breathing. I've tried lots
of other brands and always
come back to these.

Now I have a question!
A lot of my friends have
received list of coupons for
Winston’s in the mail (at
many as I in a look) and I
have never gotten any. I’m
wondering why and how they got
them? I  buy an awful
lot of these cig. and would Will
like to have some coupons
for them. Could you please-

OVER

PROJECT ETF

DESCRIPTIONS: A BRAND APPEALING TO 18-24 YEAR OLD SMOKERS

STATUS: EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF 18-24 YEAR OLD SMOKERS TO BE COMPLETED
IN JANUARY, BASED UPON FLOATING POSITIONING HYPOTHESES TO BE
DEVELOPED AND EXPLORED.

PROBLEMS: I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT THIS DESERVES A PROJECT STATUS AT
THIS TIME. IT IS STRICTLY AN ANALYSIS. PERHAPS ETF COULD EMERGE AS
A PROJECT FOLLOWING THIS ANALYSIS OR COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO YRX.

PROJECT YRX

DESCRIPTIONS: A BRAND APPEALING TO 18-24 YEAR OLD SMOKERS.

FOR 12/15 IN TOLSA, TOTAL POSITIONING PACKAGES (II: concept, product AND
packaging) WILL BE EXPLORED. A POSITIONING EVALUATION STUDY IS PLANNED
FOR FIELD ON 1/16.

PROBLEMS: NPI HAS BEEN VERY SLOW ON THIS PROJECT IN MOVING
TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TOTAL PACKAGE. I HOPE THIS DOES NOT
ESTABLISH A PRECEDENT.

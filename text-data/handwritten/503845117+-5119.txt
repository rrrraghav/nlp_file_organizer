Mechanism: Smoke Retention

Experiments to investigate possible absolute retention
of eight major mainstream smoke constituents were
conducted using seven enclosed subjects. Smoke was
delivered to subjects with a Sears kraft smoking machine
either held in the mouth or inhaled, and exhaled through
a Cohridge filter. G.C. analysis was performed on the
post exhale to quantitate the amount of eight smoke
compounds (nicotin, glycerin, tar, acetate, propylene glycol,
morpholine, phenol & 3-hydroxy pyridine) and
hydrogenone. Retention efficiencies were determined as
both lots of the amount delivered after smoke puffing
& also the amount recovered after collection to old Cohridge
recovered after mouth puffing. It should be noted
that retention efficiencies measured in this way are
expected to be lower than values reported relative to the
cigarette delivery due to smoke removal on exhalation.
Therefore, the efforts from the present experiments
are thus clearly a measure of retention in the respiratory
tract.

Although it also was suggested intersubject variability,
in absolute retention efficiencies, for prominent compounds,

Cultivating & Plan-cured Tobacco: Two tobacco seedlings
we were planted in the growth chamber June 16th and have
been exposed to a "O" atmosphere (500 cc Oxygen, 10 cc carbon
dioxide) June 18th. The plants have budded and suck legged
and are now approximately four feet tall. There of the
leaves leaves and new roots and ready to be moved. A
total of 60 millimetres of H2O has been taken up by these
plants up to this point &

Observing plants in the field at Benthamburgh. Our plants are
still struggling it's the first that we have had this trouble
reported by Kerr and 6- workers on this particular line
showed an increased occurring somewhat in the control
& regular sections. As a paper published in 1983, says
how with inhibitors such as (24205) it is difficult to
get a uniform clone. The plants are showing some signs
of stress. Chlorosis and yellowing of leaves. We have
given them a dose of "Milorganite" fertilizer.
The plants are approximately 3-4 feet tall.
We have observed that the plants are not growing as
rapidly as we would expect, but they are still alive.
We will continue to observe these plants and see if
we can reason out what is causing this problem.
The plants looked short and stunted.

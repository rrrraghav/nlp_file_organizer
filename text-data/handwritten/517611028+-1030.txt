I am writing on behalf of me
and my wife, We have saved our seals off
our Dorall packs for 3 months. And we have
not yet received our envelope to mail
them in for a free carton of Cigarettes
I smoke 12 cartons a month and my
wife 6 cartons a month. Dont you think
it's about time for a free carton.

Sincerely,

Listen & Kathryn Tuiford

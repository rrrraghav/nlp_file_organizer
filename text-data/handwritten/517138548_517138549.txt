June Status Report
Thor Miskewycz . SAM

• Partners - Direct

Worked With 2 Reps From MES Tobacco With The
Following Results:
Calls 22
DPC Signed 5
VAP Signed 2
Introduced 45

The Reps Were Instructed on Our Retail Programs
So They Could Add Sales For RJR As Well As themselves,
I.E., By Filling Contracted Displays Before Taking An
Order Resulted In More Cartons Ordered. Jobber Reps And
The Retail Accounts Were Informed Of RJR’s VAP/DPC
Promo's For The Remainder Of The Year, A Big Help
In Selling The Programs As well As Maintaining
I Feel A Work/with Program With All Direct
Reps Utilizing Our People Would Be Most Beneficial
In Gaining Relations, Distribution, Selling Special
Promos, Etc. RJR Would Spend All Or Part of
A Week With Each Direct Rep During This Program.
End Result. Mutual Partnership.

DEAR SIR,

HAVING RECENTLY PURCHASED TWO
CARTONS OF CAMEL CIGARETTES TO LAST
MY MONTH OF SMOKING, I AM VERY
DISPLEASED W/ THE QUALITY OF BOTH
CARTONS. I LIVE 17 MILES FROM THE
SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET & MY ONCE
A MONTH TRIP FOR CIGARETTES &
GROCERIES IS VERY NECESSARY. IT
IS A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO RETURN
TO THE STORE. AFTER FINDING
MY SMOKES UNSMOKABLE! THE
TOBACCO WAS VERY DRY, & HAD
A BURNT TASTE THAT I’VE NEVER
ENCOUNTERED IN MY 7 YEARS
OF CAMEL SMOKING. I AM 27
YEARS OLD, LOYAL TO CAMEL, BUT
I EXPECT SOME COMPENSATION,
OR AT LEAST AN EXPLANATION!
PLEASE REPLY ASAP.

Sincerely,
JOSH GRANVILLE

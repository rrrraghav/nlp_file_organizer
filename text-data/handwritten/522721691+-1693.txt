Dear Sirs,
Thank you for letting me try the
Eclipse Cigarette. I gave them a good
try and I do not believe the Eclipse
is for me. I think the flavoring time
should be doubled other than that
they are not bad. I have smoked P.J.
Rosemole Cigarettes more than 20 yrs.
I will not ask for my money back.
But a few packs of Winston longs would
be nice instead. Thank you,
Charles Hillman

Forworth Tobacco Products 9/17/97
Winston Salem, NC 27102 USA

for many months I have been purchasing “Manchester”, packaged for Walgreens, at $11.90 a carton, both full
flavor & mild and light non-mouthol - until last...
they asked $12.29 a pack but kept the carton price at
$11.98; however, they were always out of the lights - Now
they are asking $17 per pack, which is the same…
price yn package for “Smokes” at Stop’s Bo.-

2 weeks ago I again called at Walgreens and was
told yhr products were no longer being manufactured.
I have been a smoker for over 60 years, living still
clean - I like your cigarettes taste as well as price, and
would appreciate hearing from you - “Smokes” are
still available at Stop’n Go markets, but I cannot
afford their prices as I am on a fixed budget.

Thanks for your attention and in advance - for your
reply -

Sincerely,

Dear Dral and Co.

At least two months ago I called
the required phone number to request
an order form for free cartons of Dral
with the seal tie have been having
from Dral packs.

The lady I spoke with Marid she
was sending us two forms which we
have not received. This offer, I believe,
is due to expire and I would like to
receive the free Dral cartons as long as
we went to the bother to send in.

Both my husband and I smoke
Dral but if these offers are unusual
we may do worse smoke cheaper brands.

Sincerely,
Sharon Kostka

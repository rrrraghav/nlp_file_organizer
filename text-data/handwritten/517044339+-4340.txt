Dear Sir -

I have been calling & writing
to you about this plant two years
go? Some season I don’t seem
to be able to get on your computer.
I talk to a lady about 3 months
ago and she sent me a little
throw away ash tray.

Mark Malone was a guest of
ours about 3 yrs ago & he
receives all kinds of mail from
this company. I don’t know what
my problem is, I would like
some discount coupons and I love
the milk. I would like to order
diffused gifts. I am using Mark
Malone orders from this time you
may only be enjoyed reading the
Fly Bulletin Board.

Thank you
- Johnny L Bell

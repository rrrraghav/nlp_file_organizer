PROCESS REPORT 8-31-87

Machine - carbon graphite forming assists have
been installed to compensate for increased
paper thickness due to coatings.

Tests are being run with the double sided
nitcellulose paper applied by Roy Tuttle.
Roy Tuttle is also planning to shave holes
out of the paper to .975" width for our machine
reams.

Paper - 18 carbon type was run under test
sans restriction, all with 5% humid solution.
These are being tests evaluated by Roy and lines.
Results will be sent to Logan along with a
sample of said carbon.

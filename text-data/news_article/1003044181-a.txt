TV REVIEW
The Teen-Age Smoker

By Jack Lampe
A recent survey by the
National Association of Television
Executives has revealed a disturbing
trend: teen-agers are smoking more.
It is an unexceptionable
statement that this is a serious
problem. The survey, and
so secret cover.

The report itself is not
necessarily remarkable. It does
contain some facts—some
uncertainties, some assumptions,
some speculation, and fatal data
on the rising rate of smoking.

Although the title “The
Teen-Age Smoker” suggests a
unified area of discussion,
the report is more like a
collection of observations.

Essentially the gist is:
smoking is on the rise, and
to the proportions of morbidity
and mortality that are
unacceptable. The survey was
conducted by the Institute
Research Council, a non-profit
organization devoted to the study
of social problems. It’s director
is Dr. Earl A. Sutherland Jr.,
chairman of the Department
of Physiology at the University
of Rochester School of Medicine.

The report is an attempt
to determine why teen-agers are
smoking more, and what can be
done about it. The report
suggests that we must believe
that cigarette smoking
is a habit which can be broken.
It went on to state that those
who smoke are not necessarily
doomed.

Misrepresentation?

By Allen Green
The Institute Research Council’s
report, “The Teen-Age Smoker,” is
a valuable document. It presents
facts and figures with a clarity
that is often lacking in such
studies. But it also contains
assumptions that are not warranted
by the data.

I am referring to the report's
conclusion that teen-agers smoke
because they are imitating their
parents. This is, of course, a
simplification. There are many
reasons why teen-agers smoke, and
the desire to be like one’s parents
is only one of them.

TV Time
Direct Hit
at Smoking

By Arthur Garner
TV Editor

Whether you give up smoking or take it up again, this
is the story for you. It's about a boy named Billy.
But you can’t say that you haven’t been told all there is to
know about teen-age smoking.

This report did a good job of bringing to the front all
the facts and figures we have on teen-age smoking.
From here, it's up to us to determine what had of concern
we are going to give this major reason why they start smok-
ing in the first place. It’s not just because their parents do it.
It’s also because of the crowd.

The report says that we must recognize in our young people
that there is a desire for acceptance and recognition.
And those who are curious should understand that smoking is
not the answer to this problem. The report goes on to say
the source of the facts were frightening. Such as with pic-
tures of lungs, and all sorts of things.

The report is an attempt at a compromise among the big
cigarette companies and the anti-smoking groups.

A 30-minute drama, “Smoke Rings,” will be seen next
Monday night on NBC. It’s about a boy who starts smok-
ing to impress his friends.

Smoking
Provides No Joy

A Prober

By Jack Lampe

The report also states that the
teen-age smoker is not necessarily
a rebel. He may simply be trying
to conform. But he is conforming
to a dangerous pattern of behavior.

The report concludes with a
call for action. It urges parents,
teachers, and community leaders
to work together to discourage
smoking among teen-agers.

It also suggests that the cigarette
companies should do more to
regulate their advertising.

The report is a valuable
contribution to the debate over
smoking and teen-age health.
It is a document that should be
read by everyone who cares about
the future of our children.

Overall, U.S. kids
have things better

Life is the best it’s been around here—or so says my 14-year-old son. He's not alone. In a recent survey, 79% of American teens said they feel things are generally good these days. It’s a sentiment that reflects a broader trend: U.S. children are doing better than ever before, by most measures.

So, why aren’t we all ecstatic? Because the news isn't always rosy. Despite the overall gains, many kids still face serious challenges—poverty, violence, substance abuse—that can derail their lives. And because of these problems, there’s a growing sense that we need to do more to protect our children.

The good news is that progress is being made. Childhood mortality rates have plummeted. Teen pregnancy rates are declining. Test scores are up. All this is thanks to the hard work of parents, teachers, doctors and community leaders—and to smart public policies supported by a nation committed to giving kids a better start in life.

Turkish Farmers Battle Dust Devil

Farmers in Turkey’s southeastern region have taken to using old tires to combat dust devils that threaten their crops. The farmers pile the tires on top of each other and set them ablaze, creating a wall of smoke that blocks the wind and prevents the dust devils from reaching the fields. The technique is so effective that it has been adopted by farmers in neighboring villages.

National united in tumor research

If you’re a parent facing a child’s cancer diagnosis, you know how daunting the journey can be. But thanks to a nationwide network of researchers and clinicians, there's reason for hope. The National Cancer Institute’s Childhood Oncology Group has been instrumental in developing new treatments and improving survival rates for children with cancer.

Cameras catch food-safety mistakes

Call it a wake-up call or a teaching tool—substandard food safety practices are being caught on camera in Logan, Utah. When the findings are shared with restaurant owners, they’re often surprised to see how their employees prepare meals. Only 6% of workers followed proper procedures when cameras watched them make prepared meat. Some didn't wash their hands before handling food; others used the same cutting board for raw and cooked meats.

Prepare yourself
Food safety indicators

Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food. Use separate cutting boards for raw and cooked meats. Cook foods to proper internal temperatures: 160°F (71°C) for poultry, 145°F (63°C) for beef.

Cooks look to the paper
Many at least 10% of foodborne illness cases are linked to improper handling of meat and seafood from market to table. Share findings with restaurant owners. Recommend better handwashing techniques. Encourage cooking foods to safe temperatures. Offer tips for safer food preparation.

Smaller area helped to reduce success
The camera work had a positive impact on standards and procedures. The cameras were placed in areas where employees prepared meat, poultry and seafood. The study found that 60% of the workers improved their practices after seeing themselves on video. The power plant’s manager averages about 15 minutes of training for each employee who is caught making mistakes.

The camera project was so successful that it has been expanded to other areas in Logan, including a large bakery. Investigators could not determine whether the cameras had any effect on food safety outside of the targeted area. However, they did note that the cameras helped to improve communication between managers and employees. The program is supported by the Utah Department of Health and Human Services and community support.

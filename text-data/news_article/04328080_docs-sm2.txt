A.C.L.U. Assails Proposal
On Children’s Ads on TV

WASHINGTON, March 18 (UPI) — The
Federal Trade Commission's proposed
crackdown on television advertising
aimed at children has drawn fire from
the American Civil Liberties Union and
an expert on constitutional law.

The A.C.L.U. said in a letter to the officer
currently conducting hearings on the
proposal that it was “sweeping and infringed on
the constitutional right of free speech.”

“Our examination of this issue was
conducted against the background of
a long history of government action that threatens First
Amendment rights,” the group stated.

The agency is considering a staff pro-
posal to ban advertising of sugary foods
programs seen by very young children,
and also to restrict ads for other foods,
foods, including some breakfast cereals,
on programs viewed by older children.

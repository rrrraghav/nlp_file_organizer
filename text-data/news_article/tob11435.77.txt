No ifs, No Buts

You can’t cope out of smoking,
but the Dekalb County unit of the Amer-
ican Cancer Society doesn't want to.
For years, we’ve been short on what is
unless ex-smokers understand why they
can’t and how to control urge; therefore
we can return to their 20 pack for one more
chance at “Quit Smoking” My Life.

To effect permanent cures, the Dekalb
Unit established a Stop Smoking clinic.
Classes are progressing with at least one in
progress any week. Each class meets twice
a week for eight weeks. Teachers or
“facilitators” are themselves ex-smokers.
There is no charge to participants.

Curative steps include discussions of
why one smokes, a 48-hour trial-quit pe-
riod followed by discussion of the visits
visits by physician and a person who has
undergone removal of cancerous tissue,
and a final study of practical day-by-day
ways to fight the cigarette craving.

Such methods include the obvious –
substituting gum or a cigar for a ciga-
rette – and the less obvious, such as
altering daily routine so the link between
that morning cup of coffee and the first
drag is broken.

Nationwide the percentage of adults
who smoke is declining more rapidly in
men than women. The rate of male teen
smoking is holding steady; unfortunately
the percentage of teenage girls who
smoke is increasing.

In Dekalb success rates range from
70 per cent in some classes to 75 per cent
in others. No follow-up study has been
done among the 350 who’ve attended the
classes to see how many have stayed off.
For information on the Dekalb unit
does offer these numbers for the statistical-
minded: 19 per cent of all deaths in
all lung cancer are 58 per cent of all
cancer cite lungs. The last 10 years, the
number of women dying from lung cancer
has doubled, reflecting how much attention
the dangers from smoking have drawn

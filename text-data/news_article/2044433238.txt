Philip Morris'
Labels Tackle
Teen Smoking

Philip Morris Co. said yesterday
it has begun labeling its cigarette packs and cartons with the warning, "Underage Sale Prohibited."

The action, which is aimed at reinforcing the message that retailers that such sales are illegal, comes at a time when the Clinton administration is considering taking additional steps to discourage smoking by teenagers.

Philip Morris Senior Vice President James R. Bready said the labels, which are being printed on packaging at the company’s three U.S. manufacturing facilities, are part of a broader program to discourage underage smoking. The company announced what it calls its “Action Against Access” initiative in June.

The Richmond, Va.-based company began labeling its cigarettes this week, and the labeling will be phased in across all cigarette packs and cartons over time.

“While retailer education is useful, that kind of voluntary program won’t make a real dent in curbing sales to minors,” said Representative Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo. “This can only be accomplished through a tough, comprehensive program.”

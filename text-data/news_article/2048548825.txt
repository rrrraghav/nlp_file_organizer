Study doubts effects
of passive smoking

By CHARLES MIRANDA
Claims that passive smoking
has adverse health effects are
being challenged by new research.

A group of Australian physi-
cians has found claims of health effects
difficult to substantiate.

The effects of smoke in the air
on non-smokers, particularly
babies and children, have been
linked to a range of illnesses
or greater mortality.

Dr Julian Allanson, Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital physician,
is one of the authors.

studies were evaluated for the
half of the Tobacco Institute of
Australia’s submission.

Our review has led us to the
conclusion that there is no con-
clusive evidence that exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke in
the workplace or in the
home.”

The views were expressed during
a Senate inquiry into tobacco.

The inquiry made submissions
say Senate broadly view the case of
tobacco-related illnesses.

Australian Medical Associa-
tion president, Dr Brian Nelson
said yesterday he had not yet
seen the report but questioned its
conclusions.

Dr Nelson said there was an
increasing body of evidence to
suggest passive smoking did have
adverse health effects.

The AMA has requested to
see the full report.

An inquiry submission by the
Australian and New Zealand
Society of Environmental Medi-
cine found passive smoking con-
tributes significantly to illnesses
and mortality.

Passive smoke may
not be harmful

SYDNEY - Some of the arguments raising
alarm about passive smoking are “unsubstan-
tiated” and based on flawed research.

That’s the conclusion reached by a group of
Australian physicians who have reviewed evi-
dence presented to a Senate inquiry into to-
bacco.

The report, commissioned by the Tobacco In-
stitute of Australia, questions claims that pas-
sive smoking causes illness or death.

“There is no conclusive evidence that ex-
posure to environmental tobacco smoke in the
workplace or in the home causes adverse health
effects,” the report states.

It says many studies linking passive smok-
ing to disease are based on flawed methodol-
ogy and fail to account for other factors.

The physicians, led by Dr Julian Allanson of
Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, re-
viewed 150 scientific papers submitted as evi-
dence to the Senate inquiry.

They found that many studies were based on
questionable assumptions and did not take into
account other potential causes of illness.

“The evidence is simply not strong enough to
support claims that passive smoking poses a sig-
nificant health risk,” Dr Allanson said.

The report’s findings are likely to be con-
troversial, as they contradict the views of many
health professionals and anti-smoking groups.

The Australian Medical Association has re-
jected the report’s conclusions, saying there is
growing evidence that passive smoking does
cause harm.

“We stand by our position that exposure to pas-
sive smoke is a health hazard,” said AMA presi-
dent Dr Brian Nelson.

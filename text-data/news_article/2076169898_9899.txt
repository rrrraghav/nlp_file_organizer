In a statement, Philip Morris Co., maker of Marlboro, said its “regu-
lar” cigarettes meet FTC standards. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.
said its Parliament brand is “the only
brand that meets the standard.” The Massa-
chusetts tobacco study, which has pro-
duced more than 100 million packs of
cigarettes, found that many brands pro-
duce higher levels than those produced
under the more lenient settings on the
testing machines.

The FTC used one basis for
setting standards: to protect consumers
and non-smokers from exposure to tar
and nicotine levels in cigarettes. “We’re
trying to reduce risks,” says Philip Mor-
ris lawyer James R. Cox. “Philip Morris
is committed to reducing risk.” Says
Martin Meltzer, a health policy expert
at Johns Hopkins: “You can do it if you
want to.” The FTC is considering whether
to lower the standard for tar and nicotine.

Such changes might be supported by the
“Ultra” lights, which have been shown to
deliver less tar than regular cigarettes.
The amount of tar a smoker draws is a
function of air intake, says Robert Huting,
of the Tobacco Institute.

Studies indicating 1989 figures for
the FTC standards and levels of smokers
are provided below. The data show that
these settings may prove.

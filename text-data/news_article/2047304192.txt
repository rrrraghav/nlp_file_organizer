Tobacco
growers
protest

WILSON North and South
Carolina farmers at the Mid-
Atlantic Farm Show in Wilson
are voicing strong opposition to the Illinois Admin-
istration’s plan to expand the
FDA’s authority over the regula-
tion of cigarettes.

The Tobacco Growers Associa-
tion of North Carolina said
tobacco farmers were rallying in
Wilson to keep the FDA off the
farms.

Proposed FDA regulations
include banning vending
machines and self-service
display, banning brand adver-
tising on billboards and limit-
ing advertising restrictions and limi-
tations on the sale and distribu-
tion of cigarettes.

“This is no more than addition-
al government intrusion in our
lives,” said Luther High, presi-
dent of the Wilson County Farm
Bureau.

“We’re raising a legal crop that
is the heritage of this country,”
said Mack Thompson, president
director of the Bright Belt Ware-
house Association. “If they let
it will be a government agency
say it can fair in the regula-
tion of a crop, then that very
agency want to eliminate the
use of that crop.”

“Everyone agrees that kids
should not smoke, that’s no the
issue here said. “In fact, under
current law, it is illegal for min-
ors. We all support a number
of steps both voluntary and leg-
islative that will make this differ-
ence than it does now. But not
this. This threatens the livelihoods
of thousands of family
farmers.”

Farm Bureau, Tobacco Growers
Association of North Carolina,

Kimberly-Clark
to spin off its
tobacco interests

The company also
wants to increase
earnings by 10% yearly

DALLAS - Kimberly-Clark
Corp. today announced a series of
restructuring plans, including the spin-
off of the company’s tobacco-related
businesses and a program to cut costs
and boost earnings that could add $10
billion to its market value by 1998.

Kimberly-Clark said it expects to
increase earnings by at least 10 per-
cent in 1995 and beyond, despite
the spin-off.

“We are committed to generating
strong shareholder returns,” said Wayne
T. Sanders, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer of Kimberly-
Clark.

Kimberly-Clark said it expects to
complete the spin-off by mid-1996.
The company plans to use proceeds
from the sale of its tobacco business
to repurchase shares of common stock
and to reduce debt. The company ex-
pects to generate $2 billion to $3 bil-

lion of cash proceeds as the Kimberly-
Clark. The company said it plans to
use the proceeds to repurchase shares
of its common stock under a share
repurchase plan authorized in 1994.

The tobacco businesses in the United
States and France, the company
said, will be directed into a new con-
trolled entity that will pursue a stra-
tegic direction of a manufacturer
of cigarettes, cigars and smokeless to-
bacco and health care brands, said
Kimberly-Clark officials.

“This spin-off will allow man-
agement to focus on its atten-
tion on their business objectives
and the strategic direction of the
company,” Sanders said.

“Until recently, this board re-
posed divining these businesses
because it was not clear what an ad-
verse effect on the economic re-
turns would have been,” he said.

This plan for a tax-driven spin off
of Kimberly-Clark’s tobacco busi-
ness is to continue with its pro-
gram of cost savings and growth,
which has been in place since 1993.

“Moreover, we plan will allow
us to focus on our core businesses,”
said the company. “We are con-
fident that this plan will allow us
to achieve our goals.”

Kimberly-Clark’s tobacco busi-
nesses include Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp. and Rothman’s In-
ternational.

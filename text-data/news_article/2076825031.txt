Kelley scores in tobacco fight

State can try to recover
some medical costs, but
not punitive damages

By Judy Daffronmeier

Attorney General Fred Kelley
can sue tobacco companies to try
to recover the cost of treating chil-
dren with nicotine poisoning, but
he cannot seek punitive damages,
a judge ruled Thursday.

Kelley has sued the major to-
bacco companies for violating North
Carolina’s unfair trade practices act.
He alleges that the companies mis-
represented the addictiveness of ni-
cotine and targeted children in their
advertising.

The suit seeks $1 billion in re-
imbursement for medical expenses
paid by Medicaid to treat children
with nicotine poisoning. Kelley also
asked the court to award punitive
damages, which are intended to pun-
ish wrongdoers and deter future mis-
conduct.

Judge James C. Hazleton ruled
that Kelley can seek reimbursement
for medical costs but cannot pursue
punitive damages.

“The state has not shown that
the tobacco companies acted with a
malicious intent,” Hazleton wrote in
his ruling. “There is no evidence to
suggest that the defendants knew
their products were harmful and con-
tinued to market them to children.”

Kelley said he was disappointed
by the judge’s decision on punitive
damages, but pleased that the state
“said” Assistant Attorney
General Stewart Freeman.

“We are happy with the ruling. Ob-
viously, we wanted more, but we
won,” said Thomas Fredricks, Kelley’s
attorney. “The judge made it clear
that for the state to prove damages it
must show that each individual child
individual smoker damaged by a
tobacco product. That is going to be
difficult to do.”

“Whether that’s the right way
or not,” Hazleton said, “the law re-
quires it.”

On an unrelated matter, the
judge denied a motion filed by to-
bacco companies seeking to have
Kelley removed from the case. The
companies allege that Kelley has a
conflict of interest because he is also
a member of the State Health and Hu-
man Services Committee, which has
held hearings on tobacco issues.

Hazleton said that Kelley’s in-
volvement with the committee does
not disqualify him from serving as
attorney general in the case.

The judge also denied a motion
by the tobacco companies to have
the state pay their legal fees.

Kelley’s office has been investigat-
ing the tobacco industry for several
years, looking into its marketing prac-
tices and its role in creating a na-
tionwide health crisis.

“We are going to continue our in-
vestigation,” Kelley said. “We will
continue to fight to reduce tobac-
co use and protect the health of our
citizens.”

The suit also included a scaled-back
version of Gov. James B. Hunt’s pro-
posal to create a state fund for chil-
dren with tobacco-related illnesses,
performing poorly.

hired nicotine levels to keep smok-
ers hooked.

Kelley’s office is seeking $4 billion
in reimbursement for medical care
and for the state’s past and future
costs associated with treating tobac-
co related health problems as well as
$1 billion in punitive damages. He ar-
gued that the state has the resources
to pay for the costs of educating chil-
dren about the dangers of smoking and
to fund public awareness pro-
grams.

Hazleton said Kelley has to prove
that the tobacco companies knew or
should have known that their actions
caused harm and that punitive dam-
ages can be awarded.

“The state’s burden is a heavy one,”
said Hazleton in his ruling.

Kelley’s office estimates that the
state spends $1 billion each year on
tobacco related illnesses. He said
that North Carolina has the highest
rate of teen smoking in the nation.

“This is a victory for the children
of North Carolina,” Kelley said. “It
shows that we can hold these compa-
nies accountable for their actions.”

Kelley’s office also filed a com-
plaint against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. alleging that the company mis-
leadingly advertised its cigarettes to
minors.

The suit alleges that R.J. Reynolds
used cartoon characters and other ap-
peals to attract young smokers. It al-
leges that the company knew that ni-
cotine is addictive and that smoking
is harmful to health.

perintendent William M.
Horton said he was pleased
by today’s recent comptile
hearing officer ruling on
the south western side of
the state, but he added that
the ruling “creates a real di-
lemma.”

“We will have to adjust
our procedures,” Horton
said. “But we are committed
to protecting the citizens
of Charlotte.”

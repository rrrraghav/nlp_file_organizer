Carlton Filter Emulators

Least Carbon Monoxide

By WALTER REED, Staff Reporter.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Trade Commission, in its first test of the carbon monoxide content of domestic cigarettes, found Carlton hard-pack filters released less car-
bon monoxid than 188 other cigarettes tested.

The same Carlton cigarette, manufactured by American Brands Inc., also registered lower “tar” and nicotine levels than any other domestic cigarette in the study, which provided updated figures on all brands tested.

The FTC said the most recent test results showed a “significant increase” in the number and market percentage of cigarette brands with low “tar” and nicotine content. Of 188 brands tested, 125 of the 187 brands had 15 milligrams of "tar" or less.

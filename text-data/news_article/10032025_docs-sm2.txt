DISCOVERED

after a World-Wide Search
the IMPORTED FILTER
that does justice to the incomparable flavor
of REGENT Cigarettes!

REGENT is different—it's better. It’s made with
a special blend of tobaccos that are cured and
aged for years to bring out their full, rich flavor.
And it’s filtered through our exclusive imported filter
that removes harshness without robbing you of taste.

FILTERED REGENT—an experience!

The secret is in the way we cure our tobacco. We
use a slow, natural process that takes months and
months. This brings out the full, rich flavor of the
tobacco and makes it smoother to smoke. And then
we age our tobacco for years so that it will be even
better when you smoke it.

REGENT is made with only the finest tobaccos. We
don’t use any cheap fillers or additives. Just pure,
rich flavor.

America's First and Finest King Size Cigarette!

The filters come out fighting

• New filters coming
• Claims here

Filter cigarettes are taking over—
this biggest fight this week, fol-
lowing the recent warning from
leading doctors about the dangers
of smoking, is a battle for truth.
It’s a battle to show that some
cigarettes are less harmful than
others. We're talking about what
happens when you smoke. Tobacco
turns into smoke and goes into
your lungs. Some of it is harm-
ful. The more harmful substances
you can remove from the smoke, the
better.

Temporary without filter smoking,
most certainly will have the same
effect. We are not claiming that our
cigarette, after results of pur-
suits by the British Medical Re-
search Council, has eliminated
smoking. But filter makers won’t
say it either. The warning came
from du Maurier's president
who said that “the only way to
reduce the risk is to smoke less.”
We will not make any claims about
how filters already intervene with
harmful substances. We know, how-
ever, filtering has intervened with
some of them.

STANDARD CANCER RESEARCH
has shown that cigarette smoking
is a health hazard. The evidence
is so strong that it is now accepted
as proof of a link between smoking and
cancer. And said the millions of people
who derive pleasure and satisfaction
from smoking, must be reassured that
every scientific means will be used to
reduce the risk. We are determined to
mediate problems for the industry and
the public. It is our responsibility to
take on future concerns.

After the widespread use of alarming
warnings about smoking, there’s a lot
of talk about what can be done. The
truth is that we don't know enough
about it yet. Questions now arise:
Will filters help? Can they reduce the
effect on our health?

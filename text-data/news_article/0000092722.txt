‘Misled’ on smokes

CANBERRA - Cigarette smokers
were being misled about the amount of
tar they inhaled, the Senate was
told yesterday.

Education Minister Senator
Baume said that tar content displayed
on cigarette packets was often misleading.
He said the tobacco industry used
“sophisticated” methods to test the level
of tar content.

A person smoking a cigarette allowed some tar to escape.

A person smoking would inhale a
greater amount of tar than was often
claimed to be in the cigarette.

Senator Baume said this information
came to light during the first meeting
of a working group including tobacco
industry representatives, analytical
laboratories and Health Department
officers last month.

Senator Missen (Lib, Qld) asked the
Senate for an inquiry into the tobacco
industry’s practices - mistakenly mis-
leading consumers about the tar con-
tent which disguised high amounts of tar.
He said it was a problem for the Health Departmen
and the public at large.

The Australian Health Minister's
conference had set up a tobacco prod-
ucts sub-committee to look at the
problem.

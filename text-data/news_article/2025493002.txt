Families
go to law
on cancer
fears

IAN McKENNON

FAMILIES living near where power
cables are buried say they are taking
the Board of Trade, to court to get them
to investigate the possible link between
electro-magnetic fields and ill-health
in children. The move is the first of its
kind.

The group, representing at least
30 families living in areas including
Southall, West London, Harrow,
South Woodford, Walthamstow,
and Ilford, claim that the Government
are to seek a judicial review of the
Board’s failure to assess the safety
regulations over the cable bypass.

They allege that the Board has not
fulfilled its obligation under the
Electricity Act 1989 to protect the
public from danger arising from the
transmission and distribution of electricity, they say.

The National Grid, which is lay-
ing the 275,000V cables, says
that it complies with National Radiological Protection
Board guidelines and that households
should be exposed to electro-
magnetic fields of no more than 6 V/m.

Mary Day, the families’ solicitor,
too, claims that recent research
suggests a possible link between
low level childhood cancer occurrence
and exposure to electromagnetic fields,
where a level of as low as 0.2
V/m could be significant.

It is a highly contentious subject
which has been raised by other
villages selected, however, are wary.

Ian Stubbs, a spokesman for the
National Grid, said that the com-
pany had “always taken the health and
safety of people seriously” and that
it was “confident” that its cables were
safe.

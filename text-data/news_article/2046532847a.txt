Tories crushed
Labour crushed the Tories last night with a landslide victory which saw them win 399 seats – their biggest ever majority.

The Conservatives were left with just 229, while the SDP-Liberal Alliance took 57.

The result was a devastating blow to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who lost her Finchley seat by a narrow margin.

Labour leader Neil Kinnock hailed the victory as “a triumph for socialism” and promised to deliver on his party’s pledges.

“This is a great day for Britain,” he said. “The people have spoken, and they want change.”

The election was fought on issues of unemployment, inflation, and trade union reform. Labour accused the Tories of failing to tackle the economic crisis, while the Conservatives attacked Labour’s policies as being too radical.

The SDP-Liberal Alliance failed to make a significant impact, their vote share falling from 28 per cent to 23 per cent.

Among the notable casualties were several high-profile Conservative ministers, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Home Secretary Cecil Parkinson.

Labour gained seats in all parts of the country, with particularly strong gains in the Midlands and North of England.

The result was a clear rejection of Thatcherism and a vote for change.

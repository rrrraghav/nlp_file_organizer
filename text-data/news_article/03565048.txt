Kent Castle promo judging is focal point in FTC action

Washington, July 31—The seemingly all-powerful “inde-
pendent judges” whose decisions are final” may
have to explain their rulings in all contests if the Federal
Trade Commission has its way. In a proposed complaint against
the Kent process “Code contest”
promoted by Lorillard, the FTC
said the “preferred” methods
for selecting winners—in which con-
testants were told to put together as
many words as they could from the brand
name “Kent”—were decided on the basis of de-
ciding on winners on the basis of de-
ciding on winners on the basis of
rules that weren’t made available to contestants in
printed announcements.

Stating that the FTC believes
the prize of 50 trips to England for
two people “is not justified” by the
number of potential entrants, the
FTC said it will seek an order re-
quiring Kent of the Lorillard to
make available to contestants in
all future contests, on request,
and an explanation of how they
are judged. Winners’ “code
words” will be made oversea the
rules of the contest,” the FTC said
this as a rule of thumb.

The FTC also objected to Lorillard’s
for Kent are unfair to partici-
pants because they raise the question in contestants' minds as
to why they lost.”

The proposed complaint states
that the contract used by Kent
“makes as many words as you
can” and that winners were de-
terminated after 8,000 words with
later 6,000 were eliminated.
The FTC said that a 102-word
master list of words being used
with the “K” and “ent” themes
eliminated 151 eligible words to
create the winning code words.

remaining entries was then
checked against a master list of
words beginning with "OY," result-
ing in further eliminations. This
continued through other letters of
the alphabet until only 30 en-
tries were isolated. The win-
ners were selected based on deter-
mined by their performance in
creating words beginning with
the letter “K,” the Federal Trade
Commission stated.

To assure that participants
know the rights they would have
under a proposed order, it re-
quires that Lorillard must state
in all future contests advertise-
ments the winning entries and
how they were judged will be
furnished on request.

• In addition to Lorillard, three
other defendants named in the
suit: Robert Brian & Associates;
Robert Brian, president; and
N.C.P., the parent company of the
contest; and Blue Ribbon Promo-
tions, contest judge. All are locat-
ed in New York.

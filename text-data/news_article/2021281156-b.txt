Reynolds Tobacco Ads
Discuss Health Hazards

By a WALL STREET JOURNAL Staff Reporter
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.—R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc. said its tobacco unit will release a series of advertisements that address many of the controversies raised by smoking. The first ad is scheduled to appear today. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. says: “Over the years, there have been negative reports about smoking and health—reports that you may assume the case against smoking is closed. But this is far from the truth.”

With regard to claims that smoking increases incidents of cancer and heart disease, the first of the ads says: "Studies linking cigarette smoking to these diseases have regularly ignored significant scientific findings come from research independent of the tobacco industry."

Adding that “some of you may question our motives in view of company’s position as a corporate manufacturer,” Reynolds said: “We know that by keeping silent, we've contributed to the confusion and doubt. And trust. We must also have created the impression that we had nothing to say on these issues.”

R.A. Harrington, Jr., chairman of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, said the point of the ads is "to try and substitute rational discussion for the emotional controversy surrounding smoking."

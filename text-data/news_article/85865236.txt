Asks Cancer Society Ban
On Smoking at Meetings

The leader in the fight against cigaretts smoking in the
United States is the American Cancer Society. There’s no
question about it, it just does not look right for staff
members and volunteers to smoke at meetings. Dr.
Thomas Carlisle, retiring president of the organization said
yesterday.

“My impression is that people are inclined to question
our position on cigaretts smoking as the major cause of
lung cancer if they see staff or leading volunteers of the
society smoking in public business.” Dr. Carlisle said.
He said he would ask that such smoking be “discouraged.”

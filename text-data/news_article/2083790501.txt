Mansell finds fast track

► He turned the fastest
practice lap, 231.120 mph.

BROOKLYN, Mich. — It took awhile for
Nigel Mansell to get used to the high-
banked oval at Michigan International
Speedway. About 39 minutes.

Mansell, who left Formula One racing of
fer winning the championship last season,
said he had trouble adjusting his comments
that have become trademark in his
Indy car debut. He turned a lap of
231.120 mph to lead the opening day of
practice for Sunday’s Marlboro 500.

The Englishman was among nine Michi-
gan rookies who were given an hour of prac-
tice time before the field took to the track. It
was opened to everyone. He easily led that
session with a lap of 231.628.

Then, about 50 minutes into the full prac-

► MARLBORO 500

tice, Mansell turned the fast lap of the day,
234.934 mph. It was by far more than retired
driver Mario Andretti’s official track qualify-
ing record of 230.156, set last year.

Andretti was close behind Friday at
230.684. Nobody else could even approach
the two Newmans-Hass Racing drivers.

“What you've got to appreciate is that I’ve
never experienced anything like it,” Mansell said.
"It’s a shock to the system to go into (turns) one and
two at 240 miles per hour, and even
more into (turns) three and four.”

“You hit the bumps and move across the
surface. You feel the car vibrate.”

The Ferreri engine works very well and the car
is good,” Mansell said. “I’m still learning to
ground all of the turns, but it’s a question of
how much steering you do and how much
speed you carry off.”

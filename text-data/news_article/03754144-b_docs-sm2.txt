A Scientist who disputes correspondence on smoking

Harvard Researcher Doubts Link
Between Smoking, Heart Disease

American Medical Association News - April 27, 1950

NEW YORK – A prominent researcher has questioned the long-held belief that cigarette smoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease. Dr. J. Murray Rabow, director of the cardiovascular research laboratory at Harvard University School of Public Health, stated in a recent interview that “there is no conclusive evidence” to support this claim.

Dr. Rabow’s views are in contrast to those of many medical experts who have linked smoking to an increased risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems. The American Heart Association, for example, has issued warnings about the dangers of smoking for years.

“We have been studying this problem for a considerable time,” Dr. Rabow explained. “And while we have observed some correlations between smoking and heart disease, these correlations do not prove causation.”

He added that other factors, such as diet, exercise, and genetics, may play a more significant role in the development of cardiovascular disease.

“It is possible that smoking contributes to heart disease in some individuals,” Dr. Rabow conceded. “But it is unlikely that it is the primary cause for most people.”

Dr. Rabow’s comments have sparked debate within the medical community. Some researchers agree with his cautious approach, while others maintain that the evidence linking smoking and heart disease is strong enough to warrant public health warnings.

“It is important to remember that this is a complex issue,” said Dr. Robert B. Cook, president of the American Medical Association. “And we need more research before we can draw definitive conclusions.”

The debate over smoking and heart disease has been ongoing for decades. In 1946, a landmark study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that there was “no significant association” between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. However, subsequent studies have suggested otherwise.

In recent years, researchers have focused on identifying specific compounds in cigarettes that may be harmful to the cardiovascular system. Nicotine, for example, has been shown to raise blood pressure and heart rate. Carbon monoxide, another component of cigarette smoke, reduces the amount of oxygen that can be carried by red blood cells.

“We are still learning about the effects of smoking on the body,” Dr. Rabow said. “And it is important to continue to investigate this issue.”

He added that he hopes his comments will encourage further research and a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between smoking and heart disease.

Researcher rejects smoking-coronary link

Washington – A prominent medical scientist has challenged the claim by Surgeon General that cigarette smoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease. Dr. J.

In what advertising industry say
is a landmark move, the Food and
Drug Administration yesterday an-
nounced it is developing rules for
advertising tobacco products that
aim to restrict marketing to minors.

“We want to make sure that tobac-
co companies are not targeting chil-
dren,” Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala said at a
news conference. “This is an impor-
tant step in our efforts to reduce
tobacco use among young people.”

The proposed rules, which will be
subject to public comment before tak-
ing effect, would limit the types of
advertising tobacco companies can use
and where they can place ads. They
would also prohibit advertising that
appeals to children, such as using car-
toons or celebrity endorsements.

“This is a historic moment,” said
Michael Deutsch, executive director
of the Tobacco Control Project at Har-
vard Law School. “The FDA has never
before asserted its authority over to-
bacco advertising in this way.”

The rules are part of an effort by
the Clinton administration to imple-
ment the 1998 Master Settlement Ag-
reement, which resolved lawsuits filed
by 46 states against tobacco compa-
nies. The agreement requires tobacco
companies to pay billions of dollars
to the states and to restrict their mar-
keting practices.

The FDA’s proposed rules would go
beyond what is required by the Master
Settlement Agreement, said William
Novicoff, president of Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids. “This shows that
the administration is serious about re-
ducing tobacco use among young peo-
ple.”

Some industry officials criticized the
proposed rules, saying they would un-
fairly restrict their ability to market
tobacco products. “We are concerned
about the potential impact of these
rules on our business,” said Thomas
Fontaine, a spokesman for R.J. Rey-
nolds Tobacco Co., the nation’s larg-
est tobacco company.

The FDA is seeking comments on the
proposed rules until Feb. 15. The
agency plans to issue final regulations
by summer.

Deutsch said that he expects toba-
cco companies will challenge the regu-
lations in court. “They have done so
in the past,” he said.

Still, Harberger’s move, which
came after a year of negotiations, is
seen as a significant step toward re-
stricting tobacco advertising and pro-
tecting children. He has been willing
to promulgate such regulations, will
likely face legal challenges.

In a statement, Harberger,
said the FDA’s proposed rules
is failed but for the industry's at-
tempt to limit its ability to
target young people to promote and
sell tobacco products.

It is more encouraged than it is
expected that the FDA will be able
to withstand any legal challenges. His
actions are a sign of his willingness
to take on the tobacco industry, which
has long resisted government regula-
tion.

“They will see my compliance,”
said Richard J. Bonnie, senior at-
torney with the Tobacco Control Re-
source Center at Harvard Uni-
versity School of Law. “Other agen-
cies have been reluctant to engage in
this way.”

In a statement, Harberger,
who has long advocated for stricter
tobacco advertising regulations, said
he is pleased that the FDA is taking
action to protect children.

“This is a victory for public health,”
he said. “It sends a clear message
to tobacco companies that they can-
not continue to target children with
their marketing.”

The proposed rules would prohibit
tobacco companies from using adver-
tising that appeals to children, such
as cartoons or celebrity endorse-
ments. They would also limit the types
of advertising tobacco companies can
use and where they can place ads.

The FDA is seeking comments on
the proposed rules until Feb. 15. The
agency plans to issue final regula-
tions by summer.

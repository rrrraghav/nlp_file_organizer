SMOKING RULES FROM BIG NANNY

(Reprinted from Lima News, Sunday, November 24, 1996)

The self-righteous arrogance of federal regulators seems to know no bounds.
Apparently, without bureaucratic meddling and oversight, most Americans would
bumble their way through life from one danger to another.

We might, for instance, choose to work in a bar where smoking is allowed, then suffer
the detrimental effects of second-hand smoke.

This is a serious concern to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration
bean counters who have proposed a rule that employees not be required to enter
smoking areas “in the performance of normal work activities.”

In other words, waiters and busboys could not be forced to take orders and clear tables
in smoking sections in bars and restaurants. The proposed rule mandates that
business owners outlaw smoking entirely or provide well-ventilated smoking rooms so
that employees don’t have to breathe tobacco smoke. A new survey suggests the rule
will harm small businesses, cause some layoffs and reduce Americans' freedom and
choice. But no matter. Our federal (??) are concerned about our health -- and they
have the power to make sure we see things their way.

Haze of Death

EPA study:
Secondhand
smoke kills

By Robert Bartos



The air in a home filled with smoke is more than just unpleasant; it’s deadly. A new Environmental Protection Agency report concludes that secondhand smoke causes thousands of deaths each year and poses a serious health risk to non-smokers, especially children.

The report, released yesterday, reinforces the EPA's 1986 finding that involuntary smoking is dangerous but goes further in quantifying the number of deaths attributable to it. The agency now estimates that secondhand smoke causes between 25,000 and 57,000 heart disease deaths annually among adult non-smokers. It also contributes to about 14,000 lung cancer deaths each year.

“The evidence is overwhelming,” said EPA Administrator Carol Browner at a news conference. “Secondhand smoke is not just an annoyance; it’s a serious public health hazard.”

The report focuses on the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS, which includes both particulate matter and gases released when someone smokes. These pollutants can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, trigger asthma attacks and increase the risk of respiratory infections in children. 

Children are particularly vulnerable because their bodies are still developing and they breathe more air per pound than adults. The EPA estimates that about 300,000 children each year develop respiratory problems as a result of secondhand smoke exposure.

The report also addresses concerns about the effects of ETS on infants. Infants exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

The findings have prompted calls from public health advocates for stricter regulations on smoking in public places and workplaces. 

“This is a wake-up call,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, president of the American Lung Association. “We need to take action now to protect people from the dangers of secondhand smoke.”

The EPA report comes as Congress considers legislation that would ban smoking in federally owned buildings and airplanes. The bill has faced opposition from tobacco lobbyists who argue that such restrictions would infringe on individual liberties. 

Browner said the agency’s findings should help lawmakers make informed decisions about public health policy. “We have a responsibility to protect people from harm,” she said. “And this report makes it clear that secondhand smoke is causing serious harm.”



The EPA report also examines the chemical composition of ETS and identifies several carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents, present in secondhand smoke. These include benzene, formaldehyde and arsenic.

While some studies have questioned the methodology used by the EPA to estimate the number of deaths attributable to secondhand smoke, Browner defended the agency’s findings as being based on sound scientific evidence. 

“We have reviewed all available data,” she said. “And we are confident that our estimates are accurate.”



The report concludes with recommendations for reducing exposure to ETS. These include:

* Eliminating smoking in homes and cars.
* Establishing smoke-free zones in public places and workplaces.
* Educating the public about the dangers of secondhand smoke.



The EPA is planning a series of public service announcements to raise awareness about the health risks associated with secondhand smoke.

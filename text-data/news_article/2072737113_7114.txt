Tobacco wins a major reprieve

In one of this term’s biggest cases, Supreme Court slaps down the administration's effort to regulate the industry.

Washington—The Supreme Court has dealt the tobacco industry a major victory by ruling that the Food and Drug Administration does not have authority to regulate nicotine levels.

The highest court in the nation, in a long-awaited decision, rejected the administration’s attempt to assert broad power over tobacco products. The 9-0 ruling on Monday upheld a lower court decision and a setback for President Clinton's efforts to curb youth smoking.

The court said Congress must first act before the FDA can regulate nicotine content. It sent the case back to the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., with instructions that the agency’s attempt to set federal rules governing products containing nicotine is unconstitutional. The ruling means the administration may not be able to impose nationwide standards for tobacco products or require warning labels on cigarettes.

The court said Congress has exclusive authority over interstate commerce and that the FDA's actions would “undercut” congressional power. It also questioned whether the agency had the expertise to regulate nicotine, a substance it acknowledged is addictive but whose effects are not fully understood.

The ruling is a significant victory for tobacco companies, even if it does not end the legal battle. The administration has already indicated that it will seek legislation to give the FDA more power.

COMMENTARY

Eager to star in the clean air follies

N ow, we’ve all heard the news. The Clean Air Act is being revised. And as usual, it's a mess. 

It seems that some folks want to make it easier for industries to pollute. Others want to make it harder. And somewhere in between, there are those of us who just want clean air.

But here’s the thing: The Clean Air Act isn’t about politics. It’s about health. It's about protecting our children from asthma and other respiratory illnesses. It's about making sure that we can breathe without coughing up a lung.

So, why are we arguing? Why are we letting special interests dictate our environmental policy? 

Because, folks, the stakes are too high. We can’t afford to let politics get in the way of clean air.

And that's where I come in. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the Clean Air Act is revised in a way that protects our health and our environment. 

I'm going to write letters to my elected officials. I’m going to attend public hearings. And I’m going to speak out against any attempts to weaken the Clean Air Act.

Because, folks, this isn’t just about me. It’s about all of us. It’s about our children and grandchildren. It's about making sure that they have a healthy planet to live on.

So, join me. Let’s work together to make sure that the Clean Air Act is revised in a way that protects our health and our environment. 

Let’s show Washington that we care about clean air.

Sincerely,

The bottom line appears to be that some folks want to make it easier for industries to pollute. Others want to make it harder. And somewhere in between, there are those of us who just want clean air. 

It seems to me that the best way to achieve this is to have a Clean Air Act that is strong and enforceable. An act that holds polluters accountable. An act that protects our health and our environment.

But here’s the thing: The Clean Air Act isn’t about politics. It's about health. It's about protecting our children from asthma and other respiratory illnesses. It's about making sure that we can breathe without coughing up a lung.

So, why are we arguing? Why are we letting special interests dictate our environmental policy? 

Because, folks, the stakes are too high. We can’t afford to let politics get in the way of clean air.

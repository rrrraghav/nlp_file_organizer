HOLDS CANCER,

Industry Scientist
Disputes Theory

Washington, April 18 (AP) —
The tobacco industry today made a strong plea today for scientists to avoid what it described as a “hasty” conclusion that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

Research last year made it increasingly evident that many constitutional and environmental factors play a role in the occurrence of cancer or heart disease, said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, scientific director of the Tobacco Research Council.

“It is at present scientifically impossible to attribute a simple, definitive causative role to any one of them, nor is it possible to assign them relative degrees of importance,” Little’s statement said.

Body of Question

His committee was formed in 1954 and has been dealing primarily with the much-debated question of whether cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. The committee has a qualified panel of experts who have been studying the problem for several years.

The industry’s position is that while cigarette smoking may be one factor, it is impossible to say at this time just what its role is.

Little said the Tobacco Research Council has spent $8 million in research.

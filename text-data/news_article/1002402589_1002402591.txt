Patterns in Cigarette Vending--



Vend Magazine conducted a comprehensive survey of cigarette vending operators in August for a cross-sec-tion of facts on current operating patterns and problems in the industry. Questions covered volume, ex-pense and labor costs over the past five years, as well as prices, top-dressing, commission rates, tax costs, machine brands, and types of locations and programs and cigar vending activity.

Results were received from 35 vending companies based in 31 cities and towns of 21 states. The respondents ranged from a vendor operating 30 cigarette ma-chines to one with 2,600 units on lo-cation. They included cigarette spe-cialists as well as food vending op-erators. The field work spanned the period January through July.

The survey is taking place in an area with location availability, with 65 per cent of the public units in cities and 35 per cent in rural areas. The number of machines per operator ranged from one to 1,200.

The average cigarette vending op-erator has 87 machines, which is approximately the same as five years ago. There was a slight increase in the number of operators, but no appreciable change in these units on location.

Along with expansion in equipment, the operators generally reported in-creases in volume over the past five year period. Among 23 oper-ators giving estimates for both cur-rent and five-year-ago volume, the total-all rates were: currently--5,684,-071 packs a month or 247,195 monthly packs per operation; vs. live years—4,640,000 packs a month, or an average of 201,818 for each operator. On an individual basis, 17 of the respondents have had actual volume increases since last count through more machines. Three vendors report dips in unit sales over that period.

One has doubled his machines over the five years; another has lost one as “tightened up” and he’s quit the business with his units.

The average monthly gross income per machine is $136, vs. $120 five years ago. The average net profit per machine is $18, vs. $14.50. These figures are on a per-machine basis. This is a cigarette specialist—among many in the survey—with 97 per cent of his machines in public locations carrying brands of 50 and (mainly) 53 cents per pack, vs. standard counter prices of .46 cents and super-market prices at .51 a carton. The operator has 28 ma-chines on location five years ago and counts 1 million packs; his total monthly unit volume is now 1,900,000 packs.

The average is a current rate of $14.73 per pack, which re-flects the general nositive for vended cigarette sales in New York City, caused mainly by a combination of high tax costs (pushing it over 18 cents) and large volume buying.

Most all operators in the study are among 26 currently pricing for the same amount as a current rate of $14.73 per pack.

The average monthly gross income per operator is $11,850, vs. $7,900 five years ago. The average net profit per operator is $2,610, vs. $1,980.

* PORTLAND, Ore. — Roger
Penske is proud of his growing
ever past accomplishments, which is
probably a key reason he continues
to expand his empire, a multi-
billion dollar business empire, in the
world of auto racing. 
Ing. Going into Sunday’s Budweiser
200 at Portland International
Raceway, Penske Racing team
has won 14 races this year,
including the Indianapolis 500. Still,
there is no complacency. "We take
each race as it comes," said
"we've got to worry about next week
now." Only a few drivers, like
in Australia got away from Marlboro
Team Penske, and Emerson Fittipaldi
who won the pole at Indianapolis, Al
Unser Jr. and Paul Tracy, finished
within 10 seconds of Michael And-
retti. Adding to the success for the
Penske organization is its Winston
Winston Cup team. With Rusty Wal-
lace in second place overall. With
an eight-race winning streak. Penske
is dominating the two biggest auto
racing series in North America.

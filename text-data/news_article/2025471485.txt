Sick Building Syndrome

Sick building syndrome — the malady that afflicts workers in many offices — is apparently not chiefly the fault of cigarette smoke but rather the presence of indoor air pollutants. Instead, according to studies by the Cincinnati re-searchers, the main cause is a tiny material fiber released from ceiling tiles and by insulation that lines ventilation systems.

The fibers may be in-serted into the nose and throat or they may inadvertently picked up on mucous membranes. Symptoms include eye, nose, throat and skin irritation, headache, fatigue and respiratory problems.

Although many people assume that sick building syndrome is caused by outdoor air pollutants, many studies, including ours, have shown this to be untrue. As part of an environmental analysis specializing in indoor problems, Hodge and colleagues analyzed 27 office buildings with more than 4,000 workers in the state.

They found no relationship between the number of workers’ complaints and indicators of outdoor air quality such as wind speed, temperature, humidity or distance from industrial sources.

Only one environmental indicator correlated with worker complaints: the amount of dust on duty surfaces of microbology floors of “men-made mineral” fibers such as the silicon dioxide used in ceiling tiles and insulation (cotton cellulose) and asbestos. The most common material found in water-stained roof wool and algae mold.

Hodge said that when ceilings are cleaned with a plastic film, workers’ symptoms subsided quickly. "The cleanest offices are those with a high rate of sick symptoms was due to initial efforts at reducing dust,” Hodge said. “High Post Dispatch staff writer Mary Edgar contributed to this article

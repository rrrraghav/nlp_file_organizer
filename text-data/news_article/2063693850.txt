"Exotic Tobacco Co. Hopes to Give Generation X a 'Buzz'"
Seattle Post-Intelligencer (01/14/95) P.2; Ho, Vanessa

American Spirit isn't the only brand trying to smoke out a niche in the cigarette market. The makers of Buzz cigarettes, the Exotic Tobacco Co. in Blaine, Wash., hope to capture the hearts and lungs of Generation X with the pitch that mainstream cigarettes are "about the smoked" and “pretty boring.” You know, what people on the road less traveled?” Exotic president Hardy Bishop asked. “This is for people on that road." The cigarettes boast a new exotic smoke will “redefine the basic flavor,” which refers to a vanilla-honey-cinnamon taste.
Bishop believes Buzz’s distinctive, otherwise called American-blend tobacco did okay with her. But it's too soon to predict success. Packaged in turquoise and purple boxes, Buzz has been available locally in a few cafes and health food stores since November. Bishop said that “a few clubs” are interested. 
“Seattle is available (but) cigarettes aren’t another youth-oriented product dreamed up by some staff at a large company,” Bishop said. His company employs about four people, Bishop said, who average about 27 years of age. Has Bishop ever been criticized for trying to make a buck off young people, especially with a tobacco product? He has and this is his response: “Profit is not my goal," he said. "This has nothing to do with smoking, but with civil rights and a right to choose.”

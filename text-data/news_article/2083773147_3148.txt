last month wasn’t close as it has
been to a deal on a new transit

the impression that they were on

A devilish bargain: Cigarette-makers find a better way to lure trend-struck young
smokers—with nightclub freebies and promotions. BY MURRAY WHITE

candidate, brick walled cavern of Post
and Telegraph, where the likes of
filmmakers and filmmaker wannabes—a
bunch of them—congregate. The
scene is set by the grim confidence of
the Camel Men. They’re there to
peddle their wares: cigarettes, slicked
hair, a certain attitude. There are
various Camel brands, profiled by a
host of young women in tight skirts and
even tighter smiles.

The Camel people have found a way
to reach the young. They've gone into
nightclubs—the kind where the music is
loud, the lights are dim, and the girls
are pretty. They’re giving away free
Cigarettes, sponsoring contests, even
paying DJs to mention Camels on the air.
It’s a devilish bargain: Cigarette-makers
find a better way to lure trend-struck
young smokers—with nightclub freebies
and promotions.

The Camel Men are not alone in their
pursuit of the young. The R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., like other cigarette giants,
is spending millions on advertising and
promotion. But Reynolds has taken a
particularly innovative approach: it’s
found a way to use nightclubs as its
advertising medium.

“It started about two years ago,” says
a source close to the Camel account. “We
noticed that young people were going to
nightclubs, and we thought, ‘Hey, let’s
go with them.’”

The idea was hatched by a New York
agency, Ogilvy & Mather, at the request
of tip written by KLA marketing of
late nightclub world a funny way.
“We started in New York,” says
R.J. Reynolds Marketing man, Willis
Hale. “Then we moved to Los Angeles,
then to Chicago, and now we’re
doing it all over the country.”

The Camel promotions are subtle. There
are no billboards, no television ads.
Instead, there are free cigarettes, contests
and giveaways. At some clubs, Camel
matches, lighters, ashtrays and even
Camel-branded coasters are handed out
to patrons.

“We’re not trying to sell them
cigarettes,” says Hale. “We’re just
trying to get them to associate Camels
with a good time.”

The promotions have been so successful
that other cigarette companies are now
copying Camel’s approach. Lorillard, the
maker of Newport cigarettes, is running
similar promotions in several cities.
Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro
cigarettes, is also experimenting with
nightclub advertising.

But the Camel promotions have not been
without controversy. Some critics say that
they are irresponsible and exploitative.
“These companies are preying on young
people,” says Dr. Elizabeth Ward, a
research scientist at the Harvard School
of Public Health. “They’re using nightclubs
as a way to circumvent advertising
restrictions and reach a vulnerable
population.”

The Camel Men deny that their promotions
are exploitative. They say that they are
simply trying to market their product to
adults who choose to smoke.

“We’re not targeting young people,” says
Hale. “We’re just marketing our product
to adults who want to buy it.”

But the critics are not convinced. They
say that the Camel promotions are a
clear violation of the spirit, if not the
letter, of advertising regulations.

“These companies are trying to get
around the rules,” says Ward. “They’re
trying to reach young people in places
where they can’t be exposed to traditional
advertising.”

The controversy over the Camel promotions
has prompted some state attorneys general
to investigate whether the cigarette
companies are violating consumer
protection laws.

“We’re looking into it,” says a spokesman
for the New York Attorney General’s office.
“We want to make sure that these
companies are not engaging in unfair or
deceptive practices.”

The Camel Men say that they are confident
that their promotions are legal and ethical.

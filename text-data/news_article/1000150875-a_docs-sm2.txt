Tallies on cigarette scorecard

Two recent news items about cigarette smoking
two good; the other – less so.

The depressing need for a public report that
more people will die from this habit than ever
before is one which those who smoke should be
able to enjoy the full benefits of anti-
smoking measures.

One goals the government report that
cigarette consumption has fallen since 1956,
the lowest general figure in 17 years before the
surgeon general issued his warnings about the
link between smoking and lung cancer. Apparently
of course many people are too comfortable to
change their habits, but we must continue to
that why states should prohibit smoking in public
places unless separate zones are established
for smokers and non-smokers.



The first concerned a study by Dr. John
H. McTavish, who examined 400 patients with
emphysema. He found that 98 per cent were
smokers. “It’s a terrible thing,” he said,
“to see people slowly suffocating.”

Dr. McTavish is director of pulmonary
medicine at the University of California
Medical Center in San Francisco. He said
his study was not designed to prove that
smoking causes emphysema, but it does
suggest a strong correlation.

The other item concerned a survey by
the American Cancer Society which found
that 60 per cent of Americans believe that
cigarette smoking is hazardous to health.

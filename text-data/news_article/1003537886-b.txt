Air Force Forbids
Gifts of Cigarettes
For Its Hospitals

By JACK RAYMOND
Special to The New York Times
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6—The
Air Force has ordered Air Force
hospitals and clinics to stop dis-
tributing free cigarettes.

A similar prohibition has been
ordered on the inclusion of cig-
arettes in packages of supplies
for those personnel are prepared
for flight or for long flights.

Maj. Gen. R. L. Robinson,
chief of the Air Force’s Depart-
ment of Supply, said today that
the action was taken because of
“a growing concern” over the
effect of cigarette smoking on
health.

The directive, which went out
yesterday, follows a recent re-
port by the Surgeon General’s
Public Health Service that there
is evidence of a link between cig-
arette smoking and certain dis-
eases.

An Army spokesman said
the Army has not taken any simi-
lar action against cigarette smok-
ing. The Navy and Marine Corps
taken action.

President Kennedy said to-
day he would take a personal inter-
est in the question of whether to
ship between smoking and can-
cer. In June, Surgeon General
Luther Terry announced that
he would appoint a 16-man
board to study this issue.

The President ended the
news conference by saying it would
be “a mistake” if the United
States did not take action on
the question of smoking and health.

The Air Force directive con-
cluded with a statement that
“additional studies in this field
are being conducted.” It said that
the Air Force is “prepared to re-
vise its position” if evidence de-
velops that cigarettes are no long-
er harmful.

The directive went on to say:
“To allow the free distribution
of cigarettes in our hospitals
affects and in flight furnishes an
example to personnel who are
Air Force Medical Service, in
effect, condones cigarette smok-
ing.”

“So is to repudiate the
overwhelming evidence of many
years of research indicating smok-
ing independently on a world-
wide basis.”

The directive concluded:
“No cigarettes for engine
repair men to be given free
to any personnel in the
United States Air Force hospi-
tals will be placed in
stock.”

The Air Force has been un-
der increasing pressure from anti-
smoking groups to take action.
One of these groups, the Citizens
Committee for Health, recently
sent a letter to Secretary of De-
fense Robert McNamara urging
him to order an end to the free
distribution of cigarettes in mili-
tary hospitals.

The directive also said that
the Air Force is “prepared to re-
vise its position” if evidence de-
velops that cigarettes are no long-
er harmful.

A spokesman for the Citizens
Committee for Health said that
the group was pleased with the Air
Force’s action, but added that it
would like to see the Navy and
Marine Corps take similar steps.

The directive was issued by
Maj. Gen. Robinson in response
to a request from Secretary of the
Air Force Edward L. Codd.

Secretary Codd said that he
had been receiving numerous let-
ters from people who were con-
cerned about the Air Force’s prac-
tice of giving away cigarettes.

The directive also said that
the Air Force is “prepared to re-
vise its position” if evidence de-
velops that cigarettes are no long-
er harmful.

A spokesman for the Citizens
Committee for Health said that
the group was pleased with the Air
Force’s action, but added that it
would like to see the Navy and
Marine Corps take similar steps.

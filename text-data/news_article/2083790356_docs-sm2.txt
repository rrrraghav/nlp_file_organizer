Andretti burns up track

BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) — Mario Andretti stole the show Saturday to turn time trials for Sunday’s Marlboro 500, turning the fastest qualifying lap in motorsports history.

The 31-year-old Andretti took the pole position with a blistering lap of 234.675 mph on a virtually perfect day at Michigan International Speedway.

Andretti's effort knocked Newman-Haas Racing teammate Mario Nascimento out of the top spot and was considerably quicker than the 232.618 lap by Roberto Guerrero in 1982 at Indianapolis, which had stood as the fastest official qualifying lap until Saturday.

The record-smashing lap on the 2.0-mile, high-banked oval was not quite as quick as Andretti’s unofficial practice run of 234.95 mph, a course record of 2:18.547 set by Jeff Andretti, the youngest of Mario's two sons, during test sessions earlier this week. “I was a little worried about how things were dragging today,” Andretti said. "I

weren’t going off on time and I was afraid the track conditions would deteriorate if we waited too much longer. But it seemed like everything was just right, so I held my breath during (practice), so I just held my breath and went for it.”

“The track was good,” he added. “The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been overcast."

He had already had qualified on the warm, sunny afternoon with a 220.150, set last year’s track qualifying mark of 220.150, set last year's.

Andretti, who has held his Indy-car record to career poles, knew he had his work cut out for him.

“I attacked the track from the word go,” the four-time series champion said. “We needed to build momentum and reach the speed.”

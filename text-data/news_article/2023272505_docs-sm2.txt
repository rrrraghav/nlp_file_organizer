Haze of hypocrisy out West

THE WA Government is hiding behind a smoke screen of inconsistency and hypocrisy in its attempt to ban cigarette advertising and promotion.

It is now obvious Premier Burke’s Labor Government wants the benefits of this one advertising, such as Test cricket matches, but none of the commercial obligations.

He says it is “unrealistic” to have the WA Pollution test film November 11, shown in front of their television sets and watch it from interstate.

This would mean having to endure six hours of cigarette promotion that crops up during the telecast.

Therefore, he reasons, it would be better to have the game in Perth where the TV audience would only have to endure two hours of the signs on the normal ten to stumps telecast in the city.

Mr Burke’s juggling of principles is timely for SA as well. Mr Lance Mackey's Private Member’s Bill to ban tobacco advertising is before the Legislative Council today.

Few would argue that cigarette smoking is good for the health, but there is a principle at stake here that is far more important than a political backbend over cricket on TV.

“Surely it should remain a matter of choice and freedom to advertise a product that is next.”

What will be next target? Alcoholic beverages, sugar, salt, fats, cars or many other areas that provide us with part of our life in Australia and part of the advertising freedom?

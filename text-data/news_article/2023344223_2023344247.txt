▲ How tobacco companies secretly funded research to downplay the dangers of smoking.

▲ The trouble with tobacco company “research.”

▲ Facing the blame: Even as evidence mounted that cigarette smoking was harmful, top executives at major tobacco companies continued to deny the risks and fight regulation.

The story began in 1953, when a group of doctors met in Atlanta to discuss the growing body of evidence linking cigarettes to lung cancer. The meeting was organized by Dr. C. Everett Koop, who would later become Surgeon General of the United States.

At the time, tobacco companies were launching an aggressive public relations campaign to counter the emerging scientific consensus. They created a front group called the Tobacco Research Council and began funding their own research—research that would be carefully controlled to produce results favorable to the industry.

The trouble with tobacco company “research” was that it was often flawed, biased, and designed to mislead. It ignored or downplayed evidence of harm and promoted alternative explanations for lung cancer.

One key strategy was to focus on other potential causes of lung cancer, such as pollution and genetics. This diverted attention from the role of smoking.

Another tactic was to conduct studies that were too small or poorly designed to draw meaningful conclusions.

The Tobacco Research Council also funded research into nicotine addiction, but the results were often buried or ignored.

When researchers raised concerns about the industry’s methods, they were silenced or discredited.

“They would try to intimidate you,” recalls Dr. Lawrence Kligman, a dermatologist who conducted early studies on nicotine addiction. “They would threaten to withdraw funding.”

The tobacco companies also cultivated relationships with politicians and regulators to protect their interests. They lobbied against legislation that would restrict smoking and spent millions of dollars on advertising to promote cigarettes.

By the 1970s, the scientific evidence linking cigarette smoking to disease was overwhelming. But the tobacco industry continued to deny the risks and fight regulation.

The tide began to turn in 1994, when a team of lawyers filed a lawsuit against several major tobacco companies on behalf of smokers who had developed lung cancer. The case, known as *Engle v. Liggett Group*, uncovered a trove of internal documents that revealed the industry’s decades-long campaign to deceive the public.

The *Engle* verdict, which found the tobacco companies liable for fraud and conspiracy, was a landmark victory for smokers. It paved the way for thousands of similar lawsuits and ultimately led to the Master Settlement Agreement of 1998, in which the tobacco industry agreed to pay $206 billion to the states to cover healthcare costs related to smoking-related illnesses.

While America’s major tobacco companies were quietly conducting studies suggesting that cigarette smoking is harmful, they were concealing the results of early studies on their own – and reaching the same conclusions. Did they withhold knowledge of the danger of cigarettes from the public? If so, that research could be a crucial element in a court case against the tobacco industry.

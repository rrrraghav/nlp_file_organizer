A massive surge in the illegal trade of cigarettes is costing the country an estimated £2 billion a year.

The figures were revealed yesterday at a conference organised by the National Confederation of Employers (NCE) to discuss the problem of cigarette smuggling.

It was estimated that 1,500 million cigarettes are smuggled into Britain each year – enough for every man, woman and child to smoke 25 cigarettes.

The NCE said that the Government should take urgent action to tackle the problem, which is costing legitimate businesses millions of pounds in lost revenue.

They called for stricter controls on imports and exports, increased penalties for smugglers and a crackdown on retailers who sell smuggled goods.

“The scale of cigarette smuggling is staggering,” said Mr. John Smith, chairman of the NCE’s taxation committee. “It is not only costing the country billions of pounds in lost revenue but also undermining legitimate businesses.”

He added that the problem was being made worse by the fact that many retailers were willing to sell smuggled goods because they could buy them more cheaply than legally imported cigarettes.

The Government has already taken some steps to tackle cigarette smuggling, including increasing penalties for smugglers and tightening controls on imports and exports.

But the NCE said that these measures were not enough and that more needed to be done.

“We need a comprehensive strategy to tackle this problem,” said Mr. Smith. “This should include stricter controls on imports and exports, increased penalties for smugglers and a crackdown on retailers who sell smuggled goods.”

He added that the Government should also consider introducing a system of excise stamps on cigarettes to make it easier to identify legally imported cigarettes from smuggled ones.

The NCE’s call for action comes at a time when cigarette smuggling is becoming an increasingly serious problem.

In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of cigarettes being smuggled into Britain from abroad.

This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that cigarettes are much cheaper in some countries than they are in Britain.

It is also because of the fact that there is a high demand for cheap cigarettes in Britain.

The NCE said that the Government should take urgent action to tackle cigarette smuggling before it gets even worse.

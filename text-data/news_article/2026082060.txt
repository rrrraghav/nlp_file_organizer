calling it "Fantasy Hos-
pital."

These men who attended
the baseball camp didn't
have the best physiques or
the most experience, but
they did have what they
needed: a love for the game.

After a week of practice,
during which the 150
athletes used 440 rolls of
tape and four dozen Ace
bandages, the men were
ready (psychologically at
least) to test their skills
in a major league ballpark.

camp’s spirit of fun, the
training rules were NOT
to get in bed before 2:00 AM.
That was the rule.

With a few red eyes and
a lot of sweat, the
champions came to the
stadium for the big game.
There was a “Yankee’s
ious fit,” Yankees uni-
forms were handed out and
announced over the public
address system: "The ritual
LOW-living, and the Star-
Spangled Banner."

Before they took the
field, one of the men
said, “Men, he said, “It's right
here. It’s all here.” He
pointed to the field. “If you
can hit a ball over that
fence, you can do any-
thing in this world.”

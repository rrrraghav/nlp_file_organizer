FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

State Senator John F. Foran (D-San Francisco) today
declared his opposition to Proposition 5, the smoking
prohibitions measure on the November ballot.

"If there's anything we don’t need it’s another attempt
to legalize more government regulation of our private lives,"

Foran said. "Proposition 5 is an unwarranted scheme to write
discrimination into law. It is expensive, restrictive and
impractical. It would invite disobedience and disrespect
for the law. Read the fine print and see what they're trying
to put over on us. Then go out and vote no on 5."

Senator Foran joins a number of other legislators in speaking
out against Proposition 5. They include State Senators
Dennis Carpenter (R-Newport Beach); Alex P. Garcia (D-Los Angeles);
Lou Cusanovich (R-Woodland Hills); Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles);
Robert B. Presley (D-Riverside) and John Stull (R-Escondido).

Assemblymen who have added their support to Californians
for Common Sense in that group’s efforts to defeat Proposition 5
include Dixon Arnett (R-Redwood City); Willie L. Brown, Jr.
(D-San Francisco); Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles); Wadie P. Deddeh
(D-Chula Vista); Michael Gage (D-Napa); Julian C. Dixon
(D-Los Angeles); Eugene A. Chappie (R-Roseville); Mike Cullen
(D-Long Beach), and Frank Vicencia (D-Bellflower).

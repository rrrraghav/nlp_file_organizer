Ban would make
bowling alleys
go up in smoke

I don’t like tobacco smoke intrud-
ing on my airspace when eating.
Don't like it in my car. Don't like it in
my house.

For all that, there is one place
where its presence is accepted, if not
appreciated:

A bowling alley.

There is something mystical about
a bowling alley. (OK, today they’re
called “centers,” but the whirl of the
machines early in the morning to the
clatter of pins and balls spraying
pins at night.

It's generally pleasant. It’s smoke.
Don’t know why, it just seems a li-
beration and bowlers (not many, it
seems, are non-smokers) go hand
in hand, lane to lane.

But I suspect that soon,
bowling alleys will be as free of
smoke as a convent.

A ban is coming. Dick
Durbin says so. And Dick Durbin
is usually right about these things.

I’m not writing in behalf of the
tobacco industry, don't get me wrong.
I just think a bowling alley smoking
ban would be a terrible thing.

It would be like banning beer from
a baseball game or hot dogs from
a picnic. It just doesn’t seem right.

Bowling alleys are places where
people go to relax and have fun.
They're not places where people go to
be lectured about their health.

I know, I know. Smoking is bad for
you. And it’s bad for others. But that’s
no reason to ruin a perfectly good
bowling alley.

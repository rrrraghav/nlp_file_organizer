Tracy returns home
for Molson victory

TORONTO (AP) — The gamble
Roger Penske took when he hired
young Paul Tracy two years ago
is paying off handsomely.
Starting a 24-year-old Canadian,
second his third victory of the season
and first on a track where he’d been
a 13-second win over teammate
Emerson Fittipaldi in Sunday’s Mol-
son Indy Toronto.

Tracy won at an average speed of
196.872 mph.

Two years ago in his first race for
Penske, Tracy crashed on the third
lap of the Michigan 500 and broke a
leg. Several other crashes, including
one at Long Beach last month, had observ-
ers thinking long Penske would perse-
vere with the young driver.

Tracy’s go his first Indy car victory
at Cleveland in April, then went on to
until Portland three weeks ago, when
he finished third, that he “really began
to show a sense of patience and matu-
rity.”

“Roger and (former driver) Rick
Mears told me I had to pay attention
to all the little details — who you’re
racing with, how they’re using their
speed in the pits — things that can
catch up in a hurry. That’s what
I’ve been trying to do, paying atten-
tion to all the fine details.”

Tracy started 10th, took the pole and
won the race to Cleveland. On Sun-
day, he took no chances whatever
and won at an average speed of
fourth place in the drivers' champi-
onship standings.

Fittipaldi held the title who
finished fifth. Nigel Mansell, who
led 50 laps on Sunday’s event, has
102 points. Russell is third with 86
points.

“It was a tough race, really tough race
for me,” said Tracy. “I just con-
centrated on driving smoothly and
being very careful in passing back-
markers. I just can’t express my fed-
ing of winning here in Toronto; it re-
ally hasn’t sunk in yet.”

Tracy and Fittipaldi swapped the
lead a couple of times, but it was a
faster pit stop for tires and fuel
that put Tracy in position to win.

Fittipaldi tried hard to catch him good
on the final lap, but the Penske-
Shelby V8C began to work.
“He came off in my hand just
before the checkered flag,” Fittipaldi
revealed.

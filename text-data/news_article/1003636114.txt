FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Chicago -- Six tobacco companies have offered the American
Medical Association Education and Research Foundation $10 million
to help finance basic research on the relationship of smoking to
disease and the offer has been accepted, Raymond M. McKeown, M.D.,
Foundation president, announced Friday.

Dr McKeown, Coos Bay, Oregon, physician, said the funds were
offered with the understanding that they could be accepted only if
given without restrictions. Dr. McKeown said, "The members of the
Board of Directors of the Foundation were pleased to accept the
generous offer of these companies."

The research funds are to be made available over a five-year
period by The American Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co., P. Lorillard Co., Philip Morris, Inc.,
and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.

A joint letter signed by the Presidents of the six companies
said they were willing to contribute $10 million to the Foundation’s
previously announced research project on tobacco and health "in the
hope and expectation that the research project proposed will aid
materially in finding solutions to public health problems of national
and international concern."

Dr McKeown said that the research funds from the companies
will be made available to the Foundation in equal annual installments
with the agreement that if any of the funds are not needed or cannot
be usefully spent on the research project, the unused portion will
be returned to the companies.

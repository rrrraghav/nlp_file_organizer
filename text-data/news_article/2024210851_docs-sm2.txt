BANS SPREADING
Flights for puffers going up in smoke

BY BETSY WADE
United States, Canada,
Europe – the world is tightening
its grip on smokers. A new ban
on smoking was adopted Tuesday in
the European Economic Community,
and more are expected soon.

The United Nations officially
endorsed a global campaign against
smoking last week at its headquarters
in New York. The World Health
Organization will lead the effort,
which has already received pledges
of $10 million from 24 countries.

Typically, legislation is driven
by public health concerns and
pressure from anti-smoking groups.
But increasingly, economic factors
are playing a role. Airlines are
worried about losing passengers if
they ban smoking, and governments
are eager to collect taxes on
alternative products like nicotine
patches and gum.

The new European ban applies
to all flights departing from or
landing in member states, including
Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal,
Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and
Finland. The rules also apply to
flights operated by airlines based
in those countries but flying to
other destinations.

The ban does not extend to flights
to or from former European colonies
such as French territories in the
Caribbean, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico,
or to flights between Alaska and
Asia. It does, however, apply to
flights that stop over in Europe.

The rules will be enforced by
airlines, which face fines of up to
$85,000 for violations. Passengers
who light up can be fined $740 and
may even be prosecuted.

“We’re trying to create a smoke-free
environment,” said Jean-Hyacinthe
de Maistre, the European Commission’s
director general for transport. “It’s
a matter of public health.”

The ban is expected to affect
about 10 million flights annually,
carrying an estimated 500 million
passengers.

Airlines are already scrambling
to adjust their policies. Some have
already banned smoking on all flights,
while others are waiting for the
European rules to take effect.

“We’re concerned about the impact
on our business,” said a spokesman
for British Airways. “We don’t want
to lose passengers.”

The ban is also expected to affect
the tobacco industry. Sales of cigarettes
are already declining in many countries,
and the new restrictions are likely
to accelerate that trend.

“This is just another nail in the
coffin,” said a spokesman for a
major U.S. tobacco company. “We’re
seeing a decline in sales across the
board.”

The European ban follows similar
restrictions already in place in
Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Japan is expected to implement a
complete ban by 1996.

In the United States, smoking is
already banned on all domestic flights
and on international flights over four
hours. The Clinton administration has
proposed extending the ban to all
international flights, but Congress
has not yet acted on the proposal.

The World Health Organization’s
campaign against smoking will focus
on educating people about the dangers
of smoking and promoting alternative
products like nicotine patches and gum.
The organization is also working with
governments to implement stricter
smoking regulations.

“Smoking is a global epidemic,” said
Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general
of the World Health Organization. “We
need to take action now to protect
the health of people around the world.”

The campaign is expected to cost
$50 million over the next five years.
Funding will come from governments,
private foundations and individuals.

The European ban has been praised
by anti-smoking groups, but criticized
by some smokers.

“This is a great victory for public
health,” said a spokesman for the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “It’s
a step in the right direction.”

But one smoker, who asked not to be
identified, complained, “It’s an
infringement on my personal freedom.”

The ban is expected to have a significant
impact on the airline industry and
the tobacco industry, according to a stockbroker.
“Airlines will lose money,” he said.
“Tobacco companies are going to see
their profits fall.”

He added that some airlines may try
to offset the losses by increasing
fares or offering premium services.
Tobacco companies may try to compensate
for the decline in cigarette sales
by investing in alternative products
like nicotine gum and patches.

The ban is also expected to affect
tourism. Some people may be reluctant
to travel to Europe if they can’t smoke
on airplanes.

“We’re concerned about the impact
on tourism,” said a spokesman for the
European Travel Commission. “We don’t
want to discourage people from visiting
Europe.”

The ban is expected to go into effect
in six months, giving airlines and
tobacco companies time to prepare.

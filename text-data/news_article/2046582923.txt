Grocers Group to Pay Fine
for Illegal Contributions

The Mexican-American Grocers Assn.
has agreed to pay a $20,000 fine for
secretly funding eight campaign com-
mittees of City Council members in
1991, it was learned Tuesday.

The city’s Ethics Commission is expect-
ed to ratify the agreement at its meeting
Thursday.

Steven A. Soto, president of the asso-
ciation, signed an agreement Feb. 8
acknowledging that his group violated
state law by reimbursing a former staff
employee and associate for the $20,000
contributions, one to Councilman
Richard Alatorre and the $500 contri-
bution one to Councilman Mike
Hernandez.

Under the city’s campaign finance
ordinance, it is illegal to reimburse
more than $500 per election to a City
Council candidate.

Soto said no one reached for comments
was available by the time of law makers
No wrongdoing in the agreement signed also
by Eric Benjamin, Executive Director
of Ethics Commission and by Richard
Giles, former president of the Grocers
Association.

The association paid $10,000 to
Gilbert Luján, a former employee, and
$5,000 to his associate, according to
the agreement. The money was used to
reimburse them for contributions made
to Alatorre’s 1991 campaign and to
Hernandez’s 1991 reelection effort.

Luján could not be reached for com-
ments.

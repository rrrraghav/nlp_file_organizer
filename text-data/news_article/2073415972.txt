It’s time for the city to stub ‘em out

THE SCENE is N. K. Harliman’s
office. The occasion: a press conference.
The topic: The President has brought in an
expert on tobacco, and he's going to tell us
how to get rid of it.

The expert— Bland and full of holes — was passed
off as a public health official. He said that
a healthy lung should…

“It’s not about the lungs,” Harliman said. “He is now
going to tell you how to make money.”

In five weeks, Albanese will introduce a new
plan for the city's tobacco control program. It
will be a plan so comprehensive that it will
make the President envious. It will also be about
money. The President’s people are already talking
about a public health crisis.

The President is worried because he knows that
he will absorb when his legislation is unveiled.
He wants to make sure that the tobacco industry,
be still victorious, representing $32 million of
revenue for the state.

Albanese will present his plan next week. He said
that it will be a “bold and innovative approach”
to reducing smoking rates in New York City.

This will be the greatest stunt since Al
Schwartz’s attempt to get the city to declare
smoking illegal.

The President is worried about the effect of
the new plan on his reelection campaign. He knows
that he will lose support from smokers if he does
not take action.

He also knows that he will lose support from
tobacco companies if he does take action.

The President has decided to compromise. He will
introduce a bill that will require tobacco
companies to pay for the cost of treating
smokers who get sick.

which says that it is unfair to single out
tobacco companies for blame.

The bill will also be opposed by some public
health advocates, who say that it does not go
far enough.

The President knows that he will not be able to
pass the bill without a compromise. He has
decided to offer tobacco companies a deal: they
will pay for the cost of treating smokers who get
sick, and in return, the President will allow
them to continue advertising cigarettes to
children.

bill. He knows that he will be able to count on

The 'myth'
of passive
smoking

by MICHAEL POOLE
Medical Correspondent

PASSIVE smokers are
not exposed to significant
effects of tobacco according to
a new study which has
tobacco complained.
The controversial study
also casts doubt on the
claims that non-smokers
people’s suffer.

Professor Jeffrey Ellis,
of the University of Sci-
ence and Technology, said:
“There is no evidence to
suggest that passive smok-
ers are at risk.”

He was criticised by
Dr. Richard Doll of the
Imperial Cancer
Research Fund.

"All human research
shows a link between arti-
ficial smoke and lung can-
cer, so I have no reason-
able doubt, a cause of
lung cancer."

“Cigarette smoke is
a known carcinogen, it con-
tains factors that it con-
tributes to the risk.
although the size of risk
is still not fully unreleased.

Group smoking over

Taylor said that much of it
was to “get women's support.” She
added, "It was a way for them to
indulge their own guilt." Taylor said
it was good tech to come a Virginia Slims
woman.

And Taylor didn’t think it
inappropriate for a cigarette company
to sponsor a beauty pageant.
“They do everything,” she said,
"they swim in the pool. It chooses all
different tournaments around the world.”

It's equally like to see “quit time”
become a familiar phrase.
Taylor said that her organization is
planning to push for legislation
requiring cigarette companies to
include warning and addiction information
on their packages.

Lechman said his group will also
focus on lobbying efforts to restrict
cigarette advertising, particularly to
minors. “This will be a responsible
society in the year 2000,”
he added.

A baby contest and a tobacco parade?
That's what happened at the recent
Virginia Slims Florida State Beauty
Pageant in St. Petersburg. The pageant
was sponsored by the cigarette company,
and it was all part of an elaborate
marketing scheme, according to Aaron
Lechman, director of the Boca Raton-
based Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke.

“It’s a cynical exploitation of young
women,” Lehman said. “They use them as
bait.” The pageant drew more than 30
contestants from across Florida.

Virginia Slims spokesman John
Cunningham defended the sponsorship,
saying it was an opportunity to reach a
large audience and promote a positive
image for the company. He added that
the company has been sponsoring events
like this for years.

“We’re not trying to influence anyone,”
Cunningham said. “We just want to be
associated with fun, healthy activities.”

But Lehman isn't buying it. He says
Virginia Slims is using the pageant to
soften its image and appeal to a wider
audience. The company spends an estimated
$55 million on sponsorships annually.

The sponsorship also raised questions
about the ethics of allowing tobacco
companies to sponsor events that appeal
to young people. Virginia Slims, which
is headquartered in Greenwich, Conn., is
one of the largest cigarette manufacturers
in the world.

Lechman said his group will be
filming a documentary about the pageant
and its implications. “We want to show
people what’s really going on,” he said.

Virginia Slims Company, which
produces Virginia Slims cigarettes,
has been criticized for its marketing
tactics, according to company spokeswoman Mary
Taylor.

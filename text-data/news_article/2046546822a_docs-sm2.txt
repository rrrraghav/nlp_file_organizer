FRANCE: CAN EVEN BILL ON TOBACCO BE APPLIED?

La Tribune de Genève, 12 Jul 1995, p.28:-
CNOP, a French association in charge of making sure that the Evin bill on limiting advertising on tobacco and alcoholic products is enforced properly, is being involved in a number of legal issues with tobacco makers in France.

This is because the tobacco manufacturers are bypassing the Evin bill, which proves to be difficult to enforce.

In addition to contesting a number of statements made by scientists, like arguing that it is adherence to personal freedom, the tobacco makers keep presenting scientific surveys which tend to prove that tobacco cannot damage health. CNOP also fights this, arguing that the studies are biased owing to the fact that the tobacco makers finance them. The association denounced recently a study by Georges Rosa of the Institut de Recherches Politiques studies, which showed that tobacco was more profitable than damaging to the community. CNOP is financed by the French entity which supplies information and documentation on tobacco.

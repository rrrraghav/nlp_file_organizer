The People Speak

Smoking Report
Held Insulation

Some of us are too tired,
or at least stretch your feeble
muscles.

Heavy smoking is a cause
of chronic bronchitis.  Excessive
indulgence in alcohol.  Promis-
cuous sexual activity can
bring on serious venereal dis-
ease. Overeating may result
in obesity. The indulgence in
dairy products is a contribut-
ing factor to atherosclerosis.
The abuse of barbiturates,
sedatives and tranquillizers
can lead to addiction.  Fatal
accidents often occur
while driving.

Are we “masters of our
fate” or are we slaves?
The ominous suspense which
hangs over the Surgeon General’s
report will some-
times attempt to frighten lit-
erary men and women out
of the suburban masses.

I have spent 20 years working
as a laboratory tech-
nician, I have seen firsthand
the effect on an entirely person. During
that time I have known
many who died young.  Few
have died of lung cancer;
most have died of hereditary
or congenital disease.  Some
fatalities are dangerous
and some are not.

There is concern that one
day we will be held account-
able, but time has been
taken to consider the matter.
The Surgeon General’s report
will be published shortly. It
will contain a great deal of
information about smoking and
its effects on health.  It will
be important for everyone to
read it carefully.

To Discourage Smoking

TO THE EDITOR: The Surgeon General’s
The Report of the Surgeon General
on smoking and public health contains rec-
ommendations for remedial legislation which
follow:

Our past experience makes it ex-
ceedingly doubtful that we can suc-
cessfully eliminate a habit so deeply rooted
in existence. Our efforts in the
past have been largely directed toward
with narcotics and were both
unsuccessful, involving large num-
bers of addicts.

Nor can we hope, in an economy
so heavily dependent on the
production, manufacturing or adver-
tising of tobacco products.
Therefore, we must direct our ener-
gies to the prevention of night-
mare addiction.

The inclusion in the report of a
statement that there is no safe level of smok-
ing is an overstatement.  There is no
basis for any policy that would
prohibit smoking.  We can only hope
that we can persuade people to smoke
less and to be more careful about
the way they do it.

The Surgeon General’s report will
be a valuable contribution to the
literature on smoking and public health.
It is important for everyone to read it
carefully.

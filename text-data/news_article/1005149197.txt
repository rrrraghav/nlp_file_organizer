They’at at LaGani
Vote NO on 5





BY WILLIAM ENDICOTT
San Francisco - A little sub-
tle, isn't it? That's what a cigarette
manufacturer, which could be
called the "anti-smoking" campaign,
is doing with its billboards. The
campaign is designed to link an
ad with 36 on billboards at one time
with Proposition 5, the measure that
would ban Virginia Slims and the
cigarette industry's advertising in
Virginia.

The idea isn’t to get across
the message of anti-smoking, but
to confuse voters about Prop. 5.
"It's a cynical attempt to use
Prop. 5 to sell cigarettes," says
John R. White, director of the
campaign for Proposition 5 and
a former cigarette company sales
man himself.

That is the way the cigarette
companies see it. They want to
make people think that Prop. 5 is
some kind of anti-smoking measure
and that they are supporting it.
But in reality, they are trying to
confuse voters and make them vote
against Proposition 5.

The billboards feature a young
girl with long hair, wearing a
dress and looking wistful. The
words "Virginia Slims" appear on
the billboard.

Nevertheless, the state Fair Poli-
tics Commission has ruled that the
cigarette company’s advertising is
not in violation of any law. There is
no law limiting what cigarette com-
panies can put on billboards.

“We knew they would do some-
thing like this,” says White. “But
we didn't know exactly when or how
they would do it.”

The billboard campaign started
about two weeks ago, and the
cigarette company has been very
careful to avoid any direct refer-
ence to Proposition 5. Instead, they
are relying on people to make the
connection themselves.

“We’re counting on the public to
see what's going on,” says White.
"They'll see that Virginia Slims is
trying to use Prop. 5 to sell cig-
arettes."

Advertising for Virginia Slims
started in Virginia in 1968, when
the cigarette was first introduced.
The ads were designed to appeal to
women and to portray Virginia Slims
as a sophisticated and elegant ciga-
rette.

“We’re not against advertising,”
says White. “But we are against
cigarette companies using deceptive
advertising techniques to manipulate
voters.”

White says that the cigarette com-
pany's billboard campaign is just
one example of their efforts to de-
feat Proposition 5. They have also
been contributing money to anti-
Proposition 5 groups and running
radio commercials.

“They’re spending a lot of money
to defeat Prop. 5,” says White. “But
we’re confident that we can win.”

Virginia Slims advertising theme of
"You've come a long way, baby," was
introduced in 1968.

The billboard campaign has been
criticized by some people as being
deceptive and manipulative. Others
have defended it as an example of
free speech.

“I think it's a cynical attempt to
use Prop. 5 to sell cigarettes,” says
White. “But I don’t think it will
work.”

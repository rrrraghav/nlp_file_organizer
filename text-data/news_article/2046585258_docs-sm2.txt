OP-ED

Dr. Elders attacks
the demon weed

It’s too bad that Dr. Joyce Elders,
assistant secretary for health in the
United States, did not censure her husband or try to cripple an Olympic ath-
lete before she launched this press con-
ference. She held last week to
announce yet another escalation in
the federal war against smoking and its
forms might have enjoyed some
credibility if it weren’t for Elders’
press kit’s conversion of Dr. Elders’
remarks into a call for censorship, yet
another level of liberty, and that
is something worthy of much pub-
lic attention.

“That’s a shame, because of all the
wackos roaming in the Cuomo zoo,
Dr. Elders is one of the wackiest
and a whatever. She says sums to
summarize her nutty comments.”

Can we in this country still
use common sense and
reasoning in federal
policy decisions or are
we destined to be ruled
by zealots?

less. Congress should impose the
$2-a-pack tax and give the FDA full
authority to regulate all tobacco
products, and so on.

The irony of this gala unveiling of
yet another therapeutic war to be
fought by bureaucrats is that it
comes from the same woman who
has been accused of using illegal
feel drugs. Since Dr. Elders own son
is a known user of marijuana and his
father owns a home in Laurel, Rock
Maryland, where he keeps a sizable
some collection of youths known as
“The Posse,” who are engaged in drug-
doing themselves, it ought to be clear
that this sanctimonious loudmouth is bliss-
fully ignorant of the very problems
even as she crowns the virtues of
legalizing dangerous substances.

Further, the Elders’ rendering
of her remarks into a call for action in
the pursuit of other peoples' vices,
is particularly disturbing. As Dr.
Elders unmolted press conference
made clear, this is not about health;
it is up to a total number of plans
to control what people do and to
teach themselves away from lorens
and her ilk who are determined to
protect whatever remains of
their freedom.

That, of course, is simply non-
sense. There are millions of
people who smoke, inhale
tobacco, and don’t die or cripple
themselves. There are
people who
smoke, drink a
bottle and give it
up. There even
are people who
smoked for decades
and quietly at 93
years old, went to
dows the kitchen
to make breakfast
these people is the
last thing that Dr.
“let’s” or even
her husband, the former Clinton
aide who is now a senior partner in
the Washington law firm of Verner,
Liipfert, Bernhard, McMillan and
Polirer, wants to see.

In fact, it is not hard to imagine
that the Elders’ press conference was
arranged at the behest of his em-
ployers, who are among the largest
tobacco companies in the world.

Dr. Elders would have us believe
that we need more taxes and more
regulation. She wants to impose a
$2-a-pack tax on cigarettes and give
the Food and Drug Administration
even greater authority over tobacco
products. She wants to ban all forms
of advertising for tobacco products,
and she wants to restrict the sale of
tobacco products to minors.

She also wants to make it more dif-
ficult for people to sue tobacco com-
panies.



It is a shame that Dr. Elders has
not applied her zeal to other areas.
For example, she might have focused
on the problem of drug abuse among
young people. Or she might have tried
to do something about the epidemic
of teen pregnancy.

But instead, she chose to attack
smokers. And in so doing, she has
revealed herself to be a hypocrite
and a zealot.

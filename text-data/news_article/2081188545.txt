What Women Most: Independence

By Alison P. Mathis

Women’s history is more than a month. It’s
a year-round celebration of the contributions
of women to our society. The story of women in
America is one of struggle and triumph, of over-
coming obstacles and achieving greatness. From
the suffragettes who fought for the right to vote
to the scientists who have made groundbreaking dis-
coveries, women have shaped our nation’s his-
tory.

This year, as we celebrate Women's History
Month, let us remember the countless women who
have paved the way for future generations. Let us
honor their courage, their resilience, and their de-
termination. And let us recommit ourselves to
creating a world where all women have the oppor-
tunity to reach their full potential.

The commemoration of women’s roles in Ameri-
can history continues to challenge traditional
views. Women's contributions to science and lit-
erature, business and politics, are often over-
looked or minimized.

Moreover, it always seems to be the names of
famous women that dominate the historical record.
The National Women’s History Project is dedicated
to bringing the stories of ordinary women to light.
Recently, the Financial Life Skills project has
been launched to help identify key finan-
cial skills needed for women to achieve financial
independence.

According to Alice Kessler, president and
founder of American Association for Adult Learn-
ing, “We need to look at how technology is in-
fluencing services and industries with women in
the workforce.”

As more women are working to support their
families, from 1980 to 1995, study after study
showed that women were increasingly serving as
primary breadwinners. The statistics revealed a
significant shift in the American family.

Both opinion and female respondents to the Vo-
lunteer Women’s History Project survey indicated
that “women’s opinions matter most.” These re-
sponses, which included the top 100 responses,
included women's suffrage, women’s education,
and women’s contributions to the workforce.

Tracking the historical accomplishments of
women is crucial for understanding our nation’s
history and provides an avenue for all Americans
to learn more about women’s involvement in the
goal of financial independence.

Americans seek mentorship. Women’s equality is
an ongoing journey, and we must always be vigilant
in our efforts.

I encourage all Americans to observe Wo-
men's History Month with pride and to celebrate
the accomplishments of women throughout our his-
tory. Let us honor their contributions and work to-
gether to create a more just and equitable world for
all.

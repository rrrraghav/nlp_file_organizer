Group Health has compiled data showing that smoking is more
harmful than justified by the arrange-
ments. The cooperative says it has monitored cigarette advertising
for every business owner for 10 years and found that smoking
is a “very costly habit” to promote.

“All cigarette companies are guilty of promoting this deadly
product,” said Dr. Robert A. Stroube, president of the American
Cancer Society’s Washington division.

6 Witnesses Got Tobacco Firms’ Fees

Testified in ‘65 On Cigarette Labeling Bill

By Morton Mintz
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tobacco industry representatives paid at least six experts who testified or submitted state-
ments as independent witnesses at a 1965 Senate hearing on cigarette label-
ing legislation, The Wash-
ington Post learned yesterday.

The compensation - $108
a day in some cases - was dis-
closed in the first batch of
answers to a questionnaire mailed on Aug. 8 by Sen.
Daniel B. Brewster (D-Md).
Brewster sent the question-
naires to Sen. Warren R. Magnuson
(D-Wash), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and
to H.G. Hardy, then with
the Tobacco Institute, a trade
association representing the
cigarette industry. No one
relationship was known to
exist between the experts and
the tobacco companies other
than the compensation they
received for their services.

Hardy said that before their
1965 hearings he had repre-
sented cigarette makers in
various matters, including
labeling. He said some of the
experts in medicine and science
were in his opinion experts
who do not believe that cig-
arette smoking has proven
to cause lung cancer or other
diseases. Hardy also said:
* That at the time of the
hearings he had referred to
“industry-supported”
witnesses, but that a list of
those witnesses was provided
to the Committee by the in-
dustry.

* That Hardy if asked,
"would have readily explained
the situation" to Brewster
regarding the experts and
the sending of your letter and
the list of witnesses. He said:
“It is hardly proper” to
call them “independent”
charges,” that the practice is
common in industry and that
industry witnesses were of an
impeachable reputation” and
that they are well compensated.

"It is not astonishing, if
not shocking," that those
experts have been paid, Brew-
ster also wrote, "have been
involved in a situation,”
which he said “is implica-
tive of impropriety.” He
requested a letter that
would clarify the situation.

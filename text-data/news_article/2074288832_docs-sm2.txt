State to get
less money

from tobacco

Decline in sales
settlement payments

By Mark Curriden
Austin Bureau Chief

An unexpected sharp decline
to cigarette sales could cost
the state $20 million this year,
lawyers said Thursday.

Tobacco industry officials have
reported that cigarette consumption
has decreased 7 percent to 10 per-
cent in the United States since
January 1986, when a landmark
settlement agreement between
cigarette manufacturers and 46
states went into effect.

The settlement required the com-
panies to pay the states $3.5 bil-
lion over five years in exchange
for the states’ dismissal of lawsuits
alleging that tobacco companies
were responsible for smokers’ ill-
nesses.

The decline in cigarette sales
means less money for the state,
which receives a portion of the set-
tlement payments. The state re-
ceived $168 million last year and
is expected to receive a little more
than $150 million this year.

“We’re seeing a significant de-
cline in sales,” said John S. Mc-
Carthy, an Austin attorney who
represents the states in the settle-
ment. “The states are going to re-
ceive less money than originally
projected.”

State Attorney General Jim Mat-
thews said his office was informed
of the decline by tobacco compa-
nies. He said the companies were
not prepared to release num-
bers, but that the decline is due to
younger people quitting or never
starting to smoke.

“It’s a good thing,” Matthews
said. “But it does mean less money
for the state.”

The settlement also included a
provision requiring tobacco com-
panies to spend $240 million on
anti-smoking advertising and edu-
cation programs. The companies
are required to pay $50 million an-
nually for five years.

McCarthy said that the compa-
nies have been meeting their ad-
vertising obligations, but that the
decline in sales has also affected
the amount of money they are re-
quired to spend on advertising.

“The formula is based on sales,”
McCarthy said. “So if sales go
down, so does the amount they have
to spend.”

Matthews said his office will
reevaluate the state’s tobacco set-
tlement agreement in light of the
decline in sales. He said he would
consult with Attorney General Bob
Woodson of North Carolina and
Attorney General Steve Hansen of
Minnesota to determine whether
the states should renegotiate the
agreement.

“We need to look at this,” Mat-
thews said. “The original agree-
ment was based on certain assump-
tions about sales volume.”

A spokesman for the tobacco
companies said that the industry is
not prepared to release num-
bers, but that the decline is due to
younger people quitting or never
starting to smoke.

The industry also reached a mas-
ter settlement with the other 46
states last year for $3.5 billion.
However, their lower-than-
expected sales volume could
hurt the states’ ability to collect
the full amount. The agreement is
related to smoking and is expec-
ted to be a long process.

The industry had initially agreed
to an ongoing deal that calls for
them to pay the states about $30
billion a year for as long as people
continue smoking.

Matthews said by Mr. Rosea
and other state attorneys general
are considering whether to re-
negotiate the tobacco pay-
ments deal, which would begin
this past year to pay for new health
care programs and anti-smoking
efforts. “Probably, the way
things are going, we’ll have to see
what happens,” Matthews said.
“We will be in touch with a lot of
other attorneys general.”

The state is expected to receive a
$25 million check on Dec. 31 and
another $25 million check on Jan.
3.

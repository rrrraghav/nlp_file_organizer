Parents' smoking blamed

Nearly one in five cases of lung cancer in
non-smokers may be caused by long-
term exposure to secondhand smoke as
children, according to a new study that for the first time suggests that
parents’ smoking habits can eventually kill
their children.

Dr. Richard Peto, a statistician at the National
Cancer Institute, a co-author of the paper.
“It reinforces the need to protect the
protect the freedom of people to breathe

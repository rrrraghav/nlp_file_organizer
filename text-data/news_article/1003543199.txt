April Cancer Crusade

The month of April brings in-
it with it a rush of show-
ers and the blooming of spring
flowers all running.

It also brings with it another
type of showers—dollars to fur-
ther the fight against cancer in
the never-ending night.

Each year, the American
Cancer Society conducts this
campaign for funds and for
research. Investigators through the
nation are working at the great
medical laboratory to the gen-
erous grants to keep the bat-
tle going.

Cancer is not the great kill-
er it once was—but it remains
top criminals. Scientists, work-
ing with the American Can-
cer Society, have
turned up many new research
weapons to aid in the defense
against the malignant disease.

In the battle against the di-
sease, we must not forget the
most and most effective weap-
on—the early detection and
prompt medical help.

But for every new state-
ment of the American Can-
cer Society that cigarette
smoking causes cancer, there
now has been presshing that
cigarettes smoking causing lung
cancer.

Even some of the nation’s
top doctors have preached
the so-called gospel.

But for every new state-
ment of the American Can-
cer Society that cigarette
smoking causes cancer, there
is a statement from them
saying it.

Do they lie?

For the record, there has
been no scientific evidence di-
rectly connecting cigarette
smoking with lung cancer.
The opponents of many of
the theories have said that
there is no way to prove that
cigarette smoking causes can-
cer. They say that other fac-
tors are involved.

It’s all in the angle
you look at it.

cigarette smoking brings a
temporary rush to stop smok-
ing, but then you start smok-
ing again climbing again. Smok-
ing, it seems, is keep it in
a human being—for those who
want to smoke.

AS THE AMERICAN Cancer
Society enters its 1963 can-
paign for funds for research...

search. It would appear to
some that the society would
profit by laying off the attack
on the cigarette and stress
more on the importance of
basic research into the mys-
teries of the cell in the human
body—the mysteries which
is in normal reproduction.

Such research has intrigued
scientists for centuries, be-
cause it is research into the
life go on and what makes
life go on.

Maybe that’s a secret that
no one will ever hope to find
in a test tube—but man
can certainly keep trying.

“IF THERE IS A TIME-
TABLE,” I was told the
other day by Dr. Charles
A. Bevel, director of the
American Cancer Society,
“we are going to attack can-
cer with every weapon we can
all.”

Dr. Bevel is a man who
believes in action. He is a
man who believes that all
men must do their share to
combat cancer.

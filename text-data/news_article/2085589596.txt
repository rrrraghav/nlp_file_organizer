Miranda, Acevedo Vilá unclear about loss of tobacco money

BY LUCY D’OLIVEIRA
SAN JUAN —
The agreement to fight back Pan-
to Rican hands to lose some of its
money has been questioned by the
tobacco settlement. Calderon administra-
tion officials have not responded to ques-
tions about the matter.
Gov. Carlos G. Hernandez had said
that he was concerned about the deal,
about the way and is such that it
could affect Puerto Rico’s share of
the money.
Puerto Rico along with 16 states and
the District of Columbia will receive
money from a settlement with the four
major tobacco companies. The agreement
was reached after years of litigation over
tobacco-related illnesses.
The agreement includes a provision
that would help protect the island’s share
of the money.
The island is supposed to receive
$200 million in the first year and $15
million annually for 18 years as part of the
settlement.
It is believed that Hernandez had
questions about the agreement when he
learned it would require Puerto Rico to
give up some of its money.
The governor’s office said that he
has not been fully briefed on the
agreement and therefore could not com-
ment on it. He is expected to receive a
briefing soon, according to a spokesper-
son.

Assistant Commissioner Andrés Acevedo
Vilá said that Hernandez had expressed
concern about the possibility of Puerto
Rico losing some of its money, but the gov-
ernor’s office has not confirmed this.
“He has based on that notice,” Acevedo Vilá
said.
The agreement includes a provision
that would require Puerto Rico to declared
its share of the money.
The settlement legislation began late 60’s
and was approved by Congress in 1998,
Sept. 18, 2000 according to the article.
Acevedo Vilá said “There’s been talk
about Puerto Rico losing some of its
money.”
He said that he had not seen the
details of the agreement and therefore
couldn’t say whether it would affect
Puerto Rico’s share of the money.

It is going to find out. We need that
information, Acevedo Vilá said.
The settlement legislation includes a
Attorney General Association from man-
dated reporting requirements and other
provisions, besides the one mandating a
declaration of Puerto Rico’s share of the
money, according Andrés Acevedo.

Acevedo Vilá said that he isn’t be
familiar with the details of the agree-
ment but said that it is possible that some
of the money could go to other states or
receiving its share of money, but he
hasn't seen any evidence of that.

“We’re not going to let them take our
money,” Acevedo Vilá said. “We’re go-
ing to fight for every penny.”

vision that would require Puerto Rico to

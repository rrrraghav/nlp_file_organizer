While teachers and school district officials are trying to teach young-
sters about the dangers of smok-
ing, Denver Public Schools is invest-
ing more than $14 million in tobacco
companies. 

More than half that money —
$8.2 million — is invested in Philip

Denver school board member
Carmen Torres said she finds the
district’s stock holdings to be a
problem. “I think it’s ironic that we
are investing in companies that are
harming people,” Torres said.



Superintendent Alan Hancock
said he is aware of the district's
tobacco investments, but defended
them as part of a diversified port-
folio. "We have to invest somewhere,"
Hancock said. “We’re trying to get
the best return possible for our retir-
eement funds.”



School board member Rob
Shaffer agreed that the district has
a responsibility to maximize returns
on its investments, but he added that
he is uncomfortable with investing in
tobacco companies. 

“I don't like it,” Shaffer said. “I
don’t think it sends a good message
to our kids.”



Rob Little More, who speaks

union, said that he and other teach-
ers are disturbed by the district’s in-
vestments and want to see changes.
“It's embarrassing,” Little More
said. “We need to return that
money to where it belongs.”

not to smoke, how does it look for
us to be investing in the very com-

asked Young.



Young said the district’s pro-
gram on tobacco use is one of its
most important programs at the Colo-
rado Department of Health. “We

the district’s health curriculum.

Tom Malone, who sits on the com-
munity relations committee for Den-
ver schools, said he can't figure
out why school officials would invest
in tobacco. “It’s absolutely unac-
ceptable,” he said. "I don't know
how anyone in a position of power
is comfortable making sure we’re
investing in companies that are kill-
ing people. It shouldn’t even be
considered.”



A Dec. 30, notice from Philip
Morris announced nearly $16 mil-
lion in Denver schools' retirement
stock venture.

The Senate Crits Its Teeth at 1 Says Yes

I reached the floor of the Senate at 8:34 P.M., shortly after the bill had passed. It is known as the “pay-raise” bill, and it has been going through a lot of wrangling. But then, the House voted on it and failed to pass it. The vote was 216-210. Then they went back and voted again, and this time they succeeded.

It is said locally that if the House passes a bill to give themselves a pay raise, the Senate will also pass it. It is said that the people of this country do not like these kinds of things, but they are powerless to stop them.

C. Ford Bond, Democrat of West Virginia, said that he had voted against the bill because he didn’t want to be responsible for the appearance was said responsible for the

Taste Buds
Help Direct
Millions

Continued from Page One: Philip Morris taste panels—groups of volunteers—are asked to spend hours
each week tasting cigarettes and rating them.

The cigarettes are rated for harshness, sweetness, body
and other aspects during older
tests.

“We’ve got 11 smoke ten
cigarettes a day,” says Mrs.
Douglas in the picture.

She keeps her taste buds fresh,
she explains, by eating only
plain foods between tests.

The panels help to create
a wide variety of “smoke”
characteristics—the aroma and
odor of tobacco or the
feeling of smoothness. The
panelists also note adjec-
tives such as “sweet,” “woody.”

Panels of Consumers
Such taste tests are an integral
part of the process by which a
batch of cigarettes is judged for
consumer appeal.

Businesses use functional
tests to determine if they have
strange tastes.

“You can tell if
something’s off, really
easily,” says Mrs. Douglas. “That
would be like tasting salt in
milk.” She laughs. "It just
won't taste right."

Thousands too of 100-man
panels are used to determine
what consumers think of a new
cigarette or flavor. The panels
are paid for their time, and the
taste testers sometimes come
easily. But it’s more common
to find people who want to be
paid for their opinions.

Janet Douglas Compares Two Cigarettes at Philip Morris Taste Testing Booth. Tobacco Companies Spend Millions Annually Flavors to Add to Tobaccoes

On the Tasters' Buds Ride

Tens of Millions of Dollars

By Jerry Lawrence
and Barbara Shaffer

A cigarette, some say, is a
cheaply made, mass-produced
product. But it’s also an item
that requires millions of dollars
of research and development
each year to make sure that it
tastes just right.

The taste of a cigarette is
more important than most people
realize. It's the key to success
in the $14 billion-a-year
cigarette business.

On her taste buds—and on
the taste buds of hundreds of
other men and women—ride the
fortunes of giant tobacco com-
panies. These companies spend
millions of dollars annually
developing flavors to add to
tobaccoes.

The most important part of
this process is the “taste panel.”
These are groups of volunteers
who taste cigarettes and rate
them on various characteristics.

“It’s a very serious business,”
says Mrs. Douglas, whose picture
appears on this page. She is one
of 100 women employed by the
Philip Morris Company as a
cigarette taster.

The job isn't easy. Taste
testers must have keen senses of
smell and taste, and they must be
able to describe those sensations
in precise terms. They also must
be able to concentrate for long
periods of time.

“We eat only plain foods
between tests,” Mrs. Douglas
explains. “That way we keep our
taste buds fresh.”

The taste panels are used to
develop new cigarettes and to
improve existing ones. They are
also used to determine which
flavors consumers prefer.

"It's a very subjective thing,"
says one Philip Morris executive.
“What tastes good to one person
may not taste good to another.”

The job of a cigarette taster
isn’t as glamorous as it sounds.
It’s hard work, and it requires a
great deal of dedication. But it’s
also a well-paid job, with salaries
ranging from $15,000 to $25,000
a year.

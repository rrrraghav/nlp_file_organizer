GAPS STILL EXIST IN KNOWLEDGE OF LUNG
CANCER AND HEART DISEASE, SAYS LITTLE

Research studies have increased factual knowledge about lung cancer, heart
diseases and other ailments but "great and critical" gaps still exist, the Scientific
Director of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee said today in his Annual Report.

“There does not exist the essential experimental and clinical knowledge with
which science can even define or identify the multiple factors or influences that
may contribute to the origin and progress of these diseases,” said the Report of
Dr. Clarence Cook Little, internationally known cancer researcher and founder of
the Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Me.

“There have been and will continue to be speculations and opinions on the
causes," he wrote, "but it is a matter of scientific fact that, in our present
state of knowledge, no one knows the answers.”

He said that in an effort to help find the answers, the T.I.R.C. last year
continued and expanded its support of research by independent scientists into some of
the many clinical and experimental factors that still need to be identified,
investigated and evaluated in consideration of the origin of lung cancer,
cardiovascular diseases and other complex constitutional ailments.

Dr. Little’s Annual Report describes relevant research findings and studies
reported in 1962, and also includes abstracts of scientific articles published on
investigations supported by T.I.R.C.

During 1962, Dr. Little said, “scientific work continued to support the
view that the quest for a single, simple ‘magic bullet’ to explain the causes or
provide the cure for cancer and of heart disease is unrealistic and probably futile.

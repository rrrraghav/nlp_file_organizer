Mansell
claims
top spot

BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) - For
a guy who finds Michigan Inter-
national Speedway’s high-banked
track more than a little daunting,
Nigel Mansell sure seems to en-
joy his feats quite nicely.
Mansell, who won the Marlboro
500 last year en route to the PPG
IndyCar championship, and still
ship as a rookie, took the pole Sat-
urday for Sunday’s race at the
two-mile oval with a fast lap of
235.738 mph.

That was fast enough to draw
oohs and aahs from the big crowd
that turned out for practice Fri-
day morning, but not quite quick
enough to surpass the all-time
auto racing qualifying record of
234.279 set at Michigan last year
by teammate Mario Andretti.

“We were flat out pretty well all
around,” Mansell said. “I think
the track’s gotten a little
slower, we’re still going at
more, but no complaints at this
time.”

Mansell, who enjoys the
challenge.

"It's one of the most challeng-
ing circuits in the world. To do
more than 230 miles per hour is
quite something. You have to
have your setup just right. That’s
why being with a team like New-
man-Haas is so important.”

“It's a bit of a survival race, a
wild race. It’s a punishing circuit.
You have to be very careful with
engine and drivers as we have
to maintain it. Then the driv-
ers are very close, too. There are
probably eight drivers that could
win tomorrow.”

The Michigan field will line up
three-wide for the start of the
200-mile race. Mansell will share
the front row with Paul Rossi
who is the son of former Detroit
Mayor Coleman Young and Michi-
gan winner.

Scott Gordon, the 25-year-old
phenom who is fourth in the sea-
son points, will start from the third
row. His qualifying time was
233.478 mph. The field includes
230.449, followed by Stefan Jo-
hannesson at 230.165.

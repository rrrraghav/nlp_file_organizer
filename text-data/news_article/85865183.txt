8 Chemical Compounds Causing Cancer
Identified in Tobacco Tars

ATLANTIC CITY, Apr. 11—
More chemicals that cause cancer in animals have been isolated from tobacco tars by New York scientists.
They are trying to track down the specific compounds responsible for the effects in the hope of finding ways to eliminate them.

As described today by Dr. Norman Wynder of Sloan-Kettering Institute, the main problem is to find out which chemicals are responsible for the cancer-causing effect.

Dr. Wynder explained that the lung cancer is closely correlated with cigarette smoking.

“We know,” Dr. Wynder said, “that cigarette smoke contains a number of chemical compounds that can cause cancer in animals. We don’t know whether these same compounds are responsible for human cancers.”

Now could the offending
chemicals be eliminated from to-

be better filtration. The total tar
content drops and with it the
cancer-causing chemicals.

Through the use of a new
technique would be
possible to isolate and identify
the gluey coil as the culprit.
“We have found several different
compounds which, when given

Wynder said. “This is not proof
that these are the compounds that
cause human lung cancer, but it
is strong evidence.”

The scientists hope to identify the
specific chemical compounds that
in the animal work because formation of cancer compounds get started, they said.

*Between 75 and 80 percent of burn injuries occur at home.

*In 1978, statistics indicated that one out of five children started a fire with a cigarette lighter; by 1986, this number was one in six.

*Hot water and scalding liquids are an ever-increasing cause of burn injuries in the United States. Tap water heated to about 130 degrees Fahrenheit can produce burns.

*Burns are often complicated by infection.

*The most common type of burn is a first degree burn, which affects only the outer layer of skin.

More On Tobacco Funding

In the last issue, readers of Public Fire Education Digest may have read a commentary on the use of tobacco funds for prevention and support of fire prevention. The commentary raised questions whether accepting such funding might reduce the credibility of fire protection professionals in promoting production of a more fire-safe cigarette, among other fire-related issues.

Also included in the commentary were references to professionals in other fields who are struggling with similar dilemmas; the health community, for example, is concerned about tobacco investments, while lucrative investments, while lucrative and appropriate, could jeopardize their ability to advocate for policies concerning sporting events by tobacco and alcohol companies.

Now we have discovered information that suggests the problem is not simply one of a few isolated instances, but a systematic abuse of power, as fact-checked below because of this being so serious.

The commentary noted that the scientific community is divided on the question, the author say, and indicate the industry does not accept the opinions even of the scientists it funds.

Meanwhile, in another article from the same journal, University of Michigan researchers cites a tobacco industry document stating that the company has executed a brilliantly conceived strategy to create doubt that cigarette smoking is a serious cause of disease. In "Tobacco Industry Scientific Advisors: Serving Society Or Selling Cigarettes?" the author says the tobacco industry has used funding of scientific research to lend credibility to its position that questions about smoking and health remain inconclusive.

The author asked the 13 members of the scientific advisory board that approved industry-supported scientific research, “Do you believe cigarette smoking causes cancer?” Four members said yes; two said no; seven said they didn’t know.

A letter from a staffer at the University of California to his supervisor states that the tobacco company had "agreed to provide $2 million for research on lung cancer and other diseases." The letter goes on to say, “The company has made it clear that it wants the research to be conducted in such a way as to minimize any findings that would link smoking with disease.”

The author says that the tobacco industry’s strategy is to create doubt. "If you can get enough scientists to say they don't know, then you have created an atmosphere of uncertainty."

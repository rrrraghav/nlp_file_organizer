FDA Mustn’t Give Up

Power Over Tobacco

When two major tobacco companies volunteered to help reduce teen smoking by restricting advertising, it sounded too good to be true. It was.
The Clinton administration, with the blessing of Philip Morris and United States Tobacco Co., asked the Food and Drug Administration to back off—to let the industry regulate itself.
That’s too high a price. The FDA must not deal away this authority.

The FDA has proposed limits on tobacco marketing to teens. It is a start. President Clinton said it was a priority. However, a White House spokesman said the deal offered by Philip Morris and United States Tobacco—that the companies “trying to become a good corporate citizen.”
It’s not enough. This industry talk is more preemptive than conclusive, however. The underlying issue is: Under pressure from whom? Is the FDA going to let tobacco executives—including those from Philip Morris—decide what constitutes acceptable marketing material?

The government should be pursuing lawsuits filed by eight states—involving smoking-related illnesses.
Instead of backing off, Philip Morris and United States Tobacco propose to ban advertising in sports stadiums, near schools and playgrounds and on public transportation.

The government proposals go much further—and they should. But the FDA shouldn’t bargain away its jurisdiction—even if the goal is as important as preventing young people from using tobacco.

Smoking
bans go
too far

I really can’t claim to be a smoker. Two or three times a month, usually unplanned, I puff a smoke I'm claiming with my friends. It probably doesn't qualify me as a real smoker, though, I know that the righteous are get-ting out of control, and in Maryland they are out of control. They are trying for a governmental ban on smoking in all workplaces, including bars and taverns?

Most workplaces have non-smokers who want at least considerably close. Smoke breaks are costing businesses money in lost man-hours, but they take it slow to do it enough. Take elsewhere for fair.

Bars and taverns?

I like bars and taverns. Not because I’m a heavy drinker, though my drinking days aren't far removed. I like them because they’re places where people can relax, talk, laugh, argue, sing, dance, play pool, or just sit quietly and watch the world go by. They are community centers.

They are also places where smokers congregate. It is a fact of life that many people smoke. It's been going on for centuries. I don’t like it when people tell me what I can and cannot do, especially when they are trying to impose their will on others.

One in particular I gripe be-cause it’s a cigar smoker or pair who have cigars lit up there. Their scent is as should, packed notice the place is usually packed.

This Maryland ban, I am told, is intended to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke. It would be the most far-reaching smoking ban in the country.

It is being driven by a gen-eration of Maryland’s Secretary of Licensing and Regulation, who says it's about public health, not rights or economics.

I don’t like banners. People who want to tell me what I can control includes: Whether it’s alcohol, fat costs or to smoke. It is the people who think: 1. Their way is the only right way; 2.

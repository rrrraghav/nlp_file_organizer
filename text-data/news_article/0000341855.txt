CBS Goes to Court to Defend Local Anchorman
CHICAGO—CBS is scheduled to go to court this week to defend
two 1981 commentaries by WBBM-TV news anchor Walter
Jackson, in which he accused tobacco companies of targeting
their advertising to young people and non-smokers. Brown &
Williamson brought the suit, alleging that the reports on
which Jackson based his comments were false and old, and
that they had denied they had such a policy.

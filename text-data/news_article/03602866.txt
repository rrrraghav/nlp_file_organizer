Smoking-Related Illnesses

Cost $15 Billion: Study

Washington (UPI) - A lung disease largely caused by cigarette smoking cost an estimated $1.5 billion in doctor and hospital bills and lost earnings in 1970, a study released by the American Heart Association showed today.

The study suggested the government compare the costs of smoking-related illnesses with revenues it ob-
tains from tobacco taxes.

Pulmonary emphysema, second leading cause of mortality among Americans after heart disease, was the subject of the study. It is one of the diseases for which cigarette smok-
ing is most strongly blamed. The
study used unpublished estimates from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s National Center for Health Statistics, indicating about 1.3 million Americans had pul-
monary emphysema in 1970.

Emphysema patients paid $42.5 million for hospitalization and $103.5 million for time lost because of the disease. Work time lost amounted to a cost of $891.1 million, and loss of lifetime

earnings from emphysema details totaled $651.5 million. Drugs for emphy-
sema patients cost $27.4 million and $1.7 million was spent on research on the disease.

A bill proposed by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D Mass., and Gary Hart, D-
Colo., would levy a graduated tax on the tobacco industry, using the revenues to pay for increased research on heart disease and other diseases believed related to cigarette smoking.

The American Heart Association’s five authors, college instructors in medicine, phar-
macy and economics, said emphysema is a medical and economic problem that has no cure.

“Which is more important: revenue from tobacco production or the cost of treating these illnesses?” it asked.

It said it could not answer the ques-
tion, but added, “It does suggest that further research be undertaken to measure the total economic costs of smok-
ing-related illnesses in comparison to the revenues obtained from the tobacco industry’s excise taxes.”

Philip Morris Offers
New King Size Smoke



Philip Morris Inc., is introducing what it calls a “king size” cigarette—longer than most cigarettes now on the market—as part of an effort to appeal to younger smokers who want something different.

The new cigarette, called Marlboro King Size, will be 20 percent longer than regular-size Marlboros and about 15 percent longer than most other brands. It will be packaged in king size packs as well as in the standard 20-cigarette pack.

“We’ve been looking at ways to appeal to a younger audience,” said John R. Hauser, vice president for marketing at Philip Morris. “And we think this product will do that.”

Hauser said the company has conducted extensive market research and found that many young smokers want cigarettes that are longer and provide more smoke.

“They’re looking for something different,” he said. “Something that sets them apart.”

The Marlboro King Size is being introduced in test markets in several cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City and Seattle. The company plans to introduce the product nationwide if the tests are successful.

Philip Morris also announced that it will increase prices on all of its cigarette brands by an average of 5 cents a pack next month. The price increases are intended to offset rising tobacco costs.

The company said that the Marlboro King Size cigarettes will sell for about 25 cents a cigarette in test markets.

Philip Morris changes recall tune

From Herald Staff and Wire Reports
Tainted Philip Morris cigarettes that prompted a $500 million recall didn’t have the same problems as those found to be smelly and bad-tasting, the company said Tuesday in a statement clarifying earlier remarks.
The maker's leading cigarette maker said it had initially thought the taste was from a contaminant and had found that the true contaminants — nitrogen oxides — were causing the health problem.
The recall was justified because the 8 billion tainted cigarettes “had a taste and odor problem” and because officials feared some might not have reached the public, company spokesmen said.
Federal authorities however, are continuing investigations into reports of illnesses linked to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
At the time of the May 26 recall, Philip Morris said that methyl isothiocyanate — a chemical used to strengthen filters — was creating MITC or methyl isothiocyanate, a chem-ical used in pesticide.

Moody’s debt rating

Loews cut

BY PAUL THARP

The tobacco price war is likely to cost the Tisch fam-
ily a bigger bundle than ex-
pected.

Moody's Investor Service said yesterday that the
price-cut bleeding ciga-
rette industry could result in
a credit downgrading for
the family’s Loews Corp.,
which owns the nation’s
fourth largest tobacco firm,
Lorrillard Inc.

A downgrading could hike
Loews' interest costs for
borrowed money.

The credit ratings agency
said it will review about $1.9
billion in Loews debt and
preferred stock for a
“possible downgrade” its
decision come in
later this days.

Moody’s is concerned
about the drain on Lorril-
lard’s earnings and cash
flow following the upheap
of U.S. tobacco in-
dustry.

Not only are health
concerns but premium
cigarettes have been losing
their appeal to younger
consumers and the cheaper
discount brands.

Discount and generic
brand market share has tri-
pled in the past year to 27
percent.

Premium brands have
struggled to stop the ero-
sion of their sales by sug-
gested discounts all aver-
age, as much as 30 percent
of a pack of cigarettes.

Philip Morris and R.J.
Reynolds, the two largest
U.S. tobacco firms, also
have stepped up the manu-
facture of their own generic
and discount labels that
compete against their pre-
mium brands.

Lorrillard has resisted per-
suasion to cut its best
selling premium brands
Newport and Kent, and it is
preparing to market lower
priced discount brands to
compete in the fray.

Loews earned $65 million
from its cigarette business
in 1992 and $300 million
the first six months of 1993.
Moody’s said approxi-
mately 73% of Loews
income comes from U.S. cigarette
operations.

Loews also owns 23 per-
cent of TBS Inc.

firm CNA Financial Corp.
Loews stock rose to the
$140 and 15.86 after
the announcement follow-
ing’s new David Letter-
man show.

Just two days ago, Loews
said it would take a major
charge against earnings
over an asbestos injury set-
tlement involving its insur-
ance subsidiary.

CNA and a Chubb Corp.
subsidiary agreed to put up
$1.52 billion to settle all
claims against a policy
they wrote in 1958 for Re-
tired Board Corp.

CNA will increase its re-
serves by $500 million and
take an after-tax charge of
$370 million, or $7.26 per
share, as a result of the
asbestos settlement.

Loews’ share of the ex-
pense amounted to $194
million, or 68 cents a

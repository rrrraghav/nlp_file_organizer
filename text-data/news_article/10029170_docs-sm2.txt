Heads Tobacco State

Gov. Sanford Rips New Leaf Gains
U.S. Cigaret Data

By STELLA AUTRABACH
MIAMI BEACH - Gov. Terry
Sanford said Monday that the
federal government’s new data
on cigarette consumption is
“a little late” but “very in-
structive.”

The governor, who heads
the National Tobacco Institute,
made his comments at a news
conference following an address
to the annual convention of the
American Association of State
Highway Officials.

Sanford was asked for his
reaction to the report, which
showed that cigarette consump-
tion in the United States has
dropped sharply in recent years.

“I think it’s very instruc-
tive,” Sanford said. “It shows
that we have been successful in
reducing consumption.”

He added that the tobacco
industry has spent millions of
dollars on advertising and pub-
lic relations campaigns aimed
at reducing cigarette consump-
tion.

“We are proud of what we
have accomplished,” he said.

Sanford also criticized some
anti-smoking groups, saying
they have been “irresponsible”
in their statements about the
health effects of smoking.

“They have made claims that
are not supported by scientific
evidence,” he said.

"We've been working to show
them, listing the medical in-
formation," Sanford said. "It’s
a matter of public health and
we are trying to do our part.”

Sanford spoke before a large
audience of state highway offi-
cials at the convention. He
told them that North Carolina
is making great strides in high-
way safety, but he cautioned
against complacency.

“We still have a long way to
go,” he said. “But I am con-
fident that we can continue to
make progress.”

Sanford also discussed the
state’s economy, saying it is
growing rapidly. He attributed
the growth to several factors, in-
cluding the tobacco industry
and tourism.

“We are fortunate to have a
strong and diverse economy,” he
said. “But we must continue to
work hard to maintain our com-
petitiveness.”



Sanford Predicts

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) —
Gov. Terry Sanford fore-
made a prediction Monday
that the tobacco industry is
“on the threshold of a new
era” and that it can make
its own contributions to re-
search into the causes of
disease associated with smok-
ing.

Addressing the National As-
sociation of State Highway Of-
ficials, Sanford said the genera-
tion of “new leaf” in the in-
dustry comes after 40 years
of research.

Sanford said that a time
that producers were “withholds of
the truth,” now they are ready to
begin on what he called "a new
basis in which tobacco com-
panies will contribute to re-
search for the causes of
disease.”

He added that the industry is
ready to work with the federal
government and medical ex-
perts.

“We’re going to be able to
contribute to a better under-
standing of what we have done,
and how we can improve,” San-
ford said. “I think it will be
a great benefit to all con-
cerned.”

Sanford also spoke on the
subject of highway safety and
said that North Carolina has
made a significant progress in
reducing traffic fatalities. He
credited this to a combination
of factors, including stricter
laws and increased public
awareness.

“We’ve made great strides,”
Sanford said. “But we still have
a long way to go.”

He also touched on the state’s
economy, noting that it has
grown significantly in recent
years. He attributed this growth
to a number of factors, includ-
ing the tobacco industry and
tourism.

“We are fortunate to have a
strong and diverse economy,”
Sanford said. “But we must
continue to work hard to main-
tain our competitiveness.”

He also spoke on the subject
of education, saying that North
Carolina is committed to pro-
viding all of its citizens with
a quality education. He added
that the state is making progress
in reducing illiteracy and in-
creasing high school graduation
rates.

Cigarette Maker Wins $5 Million in TV Libel Case

(FT DIX, N.J.—A Federal jury has awarded Lorillard Tobacco Company $5 million in damages from CBS Inc. for libel.

The verdict, returned late Tuesday afternoon, ended a three-year-old lawsuit filed by Lorillard against CBS and its Washington affiliate, WUSA-TV. The suit stemmed from a 1982 report on the television program “60 Minutes” that suggested Lorillard was deliberately concealing information about the addictiveness of nicotine in cigarettes.

The jury found that WUSA-TV and CBS acted with actual malice—a legal standard required for libel suits against public figures—in broadcasting the report.

“This is a victory for every American company that has been unfairly maligned by irresponsible journalism,” said John R. Campion, Lorillard’s chairman, in a statement released after the verdict. “CBS and WUSA-TV made reckless accusations without bothering to verify them.”

CBS issued a brief statement saying it was disappointed with the verdict and would consider an appeal.

The suit centered on a segment of “60 Minutes” that featured excerpts from internal Lorillard documents. The report suggested that company officials knew about nicotine’s addictive properties but were concealing this information from the public.

Lorillard contended that the documents had been taken out of context and that the report implied it was deliberately deceiving consumers.

The jury found that WUSA-TV and CBS failed to make a reasonable effort to determine the truth of their allegations before broadcasting them.

During the trial, Lorillard’s lawyers presented testimony from company executives who said they believed nicotine was addictive but denied any intent to mislead the public. They also introduced evidence suggesting that the documents were obtained illegally by a former employee.

CBS’s lawyers argued that the “60 Minutes” report was protected by the First Amendment and that it accurately reflected the contents of the Lorillard documents.

The jury deliberated for 14 hours before reaching its verdict. The $5 million award is believed to be one of the largest libel damages ever awarded in a case involving a corporation.

Lorillard’s lawyers said they would seek to recover attorney fees and other costs from CBS.

CBS has been involved in several high-profile libel suits over the years. In 1984, it settled a suit with General Motors for $14 million.

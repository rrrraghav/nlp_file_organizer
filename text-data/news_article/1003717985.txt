THE COUGH THAT CARRIES
YOU OFF

Tonight’s Panorama (8.10pm) is about the most dangerous country in
the world – smoking. The subject
is introduced by our programme's
reporter, Peter Taylor, who fronted
a series of investigations on the
subject while he was with Thames
Television. He has since been
convinced by the horror stories he
uncovered.

Most authorities now agree with
the Prime Minister’s definition of
cigarette smoking as “the biggest
preventable cause of premature
death” in Britain, and the estimate is
that 80,000 people die each year
from smoking-related effects.
However, you can't tell the tobacco
companies that. The warnings printed
on cigarette packs contain only truth
in the vaguest terms. Peter Taylor has
investigated their stance in America
and finds that they have never
admitted that cigarettes are harmful,
and insist there is nothing that has yet
been proved”. says Taylor, who
then proceeds to prove that the US
tobacco industry knows the facts about smoking. The bulk
of this investigation concerns the
hue-happy America total around 40
million dollars.

But if it is West the tobacco
industry is fighting a rearguard
action, and doing so in a way in
better shape than is customary in the
World. “In twenty years we will
have heart disease and lung cancer and
heart disease in Brazil such at you
have seen in the Western world,” says
Sao Paulo doctor. "Brazil has bigger
social problems to grapple with, and
the Brazilian government’s restrictive
legislation on cigarette advertising
is a joke.” In the Old World,
Brazians are sold cigarettes by
glamorous super symbols and
health warnings are never mentioned.

“There's nothing like a good anti-
smoking campaign helps you look
at yourself,” says Peter Taylor. “If
cigarette ads didn’t turn out to look
like the dumb things they do, I
doubt that anyone would ever smoke.”

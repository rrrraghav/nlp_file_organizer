smoking snuffed in county buildings

A 8-to-one vote by Columbia city commissioners Tuesday night outlawed smoking in all city owned buildings.



There are things you won’t find in the official minutes of the meeting, but they happened. One was a heated discussion over whether Daniel Boone County-City Health Department officials should be allowed to smoke in their offices.

During a commission meeting Monday night, commissioners Lindy Vogel and John Beets voiced concern that county health director Mike Miller said he could not allow his staff to smoke in private offices. 

“They’ve got to have some place to go,” Vogel said. “I don't think it is fair to tell them they can’t.”

Miller said the county is good about providing areas for smokers throughout the county.

“They let her private offices switch in for private offices,” Miller said. “We are trying to do that little bit.”

The new ordinance was requested by Health Director Mike Miller. The wording of the smoking ban stated that it would apply to all county owned buildings, including a tunnel connecting the courthouse and the health department. 

Beets said he couldn’t support allowing county officials to smoke in private offices. “I don't think we should allow them to do that,” Beets said.

Miller said that the county can set up an area for smokers outside of buildings.

“It seems way I see other two divisions of the smoking ban is held to be a mistake.”

Commissioners said the ban would go into effect immediately, and it would not affect non-smoking areas or private offices. 

The government center is set to open later this first day of business for the public. The commissioners said they would need to even consider banning smoking county wide in the near future.

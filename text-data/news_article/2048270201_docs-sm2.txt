Survey blow to passive smoke claims

BY NICHOLE FARRELL
THE first comprehensive study
to directly link passive smoking
to heart disease has been released,
the result of the equivalent of
five years’ work by a team of
American researchers. The results
last week suggest that the breath
of someone exposed to cigarette
emissions in an enclosed space is
as dangerous as if they were
smoking themselves.

The study was based on 300 men,
300 women and 250 non-smokers
who volunteered for tests.
Scientists at Kansas England at
the University of Missouri’s
Missouri Cardiovascular Research
Institute, pressurised to 55
pounds per square inch in a
specially designed chamber.

Dr Simon Litwin, who headed the
research team, said that the
results were “astonishing”. He
added: "We found that exposure
to cigarette smoke for just one
hour can cause significant
changes in blood pressure and
heart rate.”

The survey, published in the
American Heart Journal, was
funded by the American Tobacco
Companies-controlled Institute for
Tobacco Research.

It is believed that the nation’s
doctors are concerned at the equivalent
of a heart attack risk. The study
will be presented to the World Health
Organisation next year.

Dr Ron Phillips, who headed the
research team, said: “The results
are astounding or provocative, if I
dare say so, and we hope they will
help with further research into
tobacco.”

That view was echoed by Dr
Peter Woodward, deputy director
of the Institute for Tobacco Research
group in Berlin, West Germany. "These
findings are extremely important,”
he said. “We’ve always suspected
that passive smoking could be
harmful, but this study provides
evidence."

The last test made was that tests
were conducted to see if there
was any effect on the arteries. It
is believed an enzyme responsible
for blood clotting was affected.

“It is a major exposure,” Dr
Litwin said. “We’ve found that
exposure to cigarette smoke for just
one hour can cause significant
changes in blood pressure and heart
rate.” The study was funded by the
American Tobacco Companies-controlled
Institute for Tobacco Research, and
the results will be presented to the
World Health Organisation next year.

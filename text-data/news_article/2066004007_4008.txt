What Smoke? New Device
Keeps Cigarettes in a 'Box'

BY GLENN COLLINS

The Philip Morris Companies is planning to
test a “nicotine-delivery system” that
eliminates the smoke and ashes from the end
of a cigarette.

The battery-powered "smoking system" is
the result of 15 years of research,
developer says.

The device, about the size of a pack, will
contain a specially designed cigarette and
rechargeable batteries. The tobacco burns
only when the user inhales, drawing smoke
from a cigarette in its holder, then it stops
and releases an hour later.

The smoker can puff till he or she likes
for each puff, as if smoking than. That is
exactly how Humphrey Bogart
a cigarette dangling from his lips. One
of the advantages of this device is that
with a cellular phone in one hand, the smoking
device in the other, and no ashes to worry
carry the company.

The company says it will demonstrate the
lengths to which the tobacco industry will go to
make cigarettes more palatable and
acceptable. Richard A. DeLuca, chairman of
the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University
School of Law, called the device “clearly another nicotine-delivery device.”
“It’s a way to make tobacco, mint,
and coumarin taste like this if it doesn't,”
he said. “They are trying to make smoking
appealing again.”

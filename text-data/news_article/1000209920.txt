A Frank Statement

to



Cigarette Smokers




Prepared by Action Committee for Responsible Tobacco Promotion





Only you can stop the spread of false and misleading information about tobacco.



The fact that you are a cigarette smoker means you are interested in this statement. Here is how it came to be:



1.  It is being published and mailed to every household in America.

2.  It is a frank, truthful report on all sides of the tobacco issue. It tells what the tobacco industry is doing and why. It explains the health aspects and answers many questions.

3.  It is paid for by the cigarette companies themselves—the very people who are being criticized.



We believe this statement will help you understand. We hope it will also convince others that the tobacco industry is committed to truth and responsible action.



The purpose of this report is to give you the facts. It is not an advertisement. It does not urge you to smoke more cigarettes. In fact, it urges moderation in all things.



We have always believed in telling the truth about tobacco. We believe you want to know what we are doing and why.



Here are the main points of this statement:



1.  The cigarette companies are spending millions of dollars each year to support medical research. This research is designed to determine the effect of smoking on health.

2.  The industry has established a Tobacco Industry Research Committee to coordinate all research activities.

3.  The committee will make its findings available to scientists and others interested in this subject.



4.  A panel of distinguished scientists, not employed by the tobacco industry, will review all research data. Their opinions will be made public.

5.  The cigarette companies are working with government agencies to develop regulations for the sale and advertising of cigarettes.



6.  We are aware that there are many questions about the health effects of smoking. We believe these questions should be answered by science, not by sensationalism or unsupported claims.



7.  We have always been ready to accept responsibility for our actions. We will continue to do so.



8.  The industry is committed to responsible advertising. We believe that all advertising should be truthful and accurate.



9.  We are proud of the contribution tobacco has made to American agriculture and economy. But we also recognize that there are problems that must be solved.



10. We want you to know what we are doing to solve these problems. This statement is one step in that direction.





This statement has been prepared to show what the tobacco industry is doing to promote responsible practices and to provide accurate information.

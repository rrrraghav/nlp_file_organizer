Blacksburg – Dr. Ronald E. Hahn was formally installed
as the tenth president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University at a special ceremony in Burruss Hall
Monday afternoon.

Secretary of Commerce J. Woodson Maury delivered the
principal address, emphasizing that the continued growth
of the economy is essential to the nation’s commitment
to agricultural research and extension programs. He
praised Hahn and outlined a proposed joint program for
the state's universities.

“The broad plan will call for cooperation between
institutions of higher education and industry,” Maury said,
"and it will serve as an example to other states in the
university-industry extension service.”

Dr. Hahn’s acceptance speech centered on VPI’s role
in the concept of the land-grant colleges, such as VPI, which
were established to provide practical education for all.
“The early days were geared primarily to agriculture,” he
said, “but now we must broaden our scope and extend
the route of the educational journey.”

Dr. Hahn was appointed president in June and is the
youngest VPI president ever and the youngest among
the presidents of the land-grant colleges in the South.
Engineering students, agricultural sciences students, and
other members of the university community comprised a large
portion of the audience.

Governor Harrison pledged his support for VPI’s programs
and said that more than 100,000 Virginians benefit annually
from its services. (Story on page 6)

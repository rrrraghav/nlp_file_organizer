WA laws may need rethink

Anti-tobacco campaigners were quick to seize on the impact of the WHO study on passive smoking in public places from August 1.

The West Australian Medical Association said the findings demanded that Health Minister State Gormley to review legislation.

The adjustment rites, Minister Grattan Reith are believed to be considering whether passive smoking is injurious to health. Dr Roberts said:

“The Government would have to rely on many sources to determine whether passive smoking was dangerous to health.”

There were up to 100 other studies which had examined the link between passive smok-
ing and cancer.

Dr Roberts said any study which suggested that passive smoking required close public scrutiny, “and not just from medical journals”.

“Such a suggestion would be highly controversial,” he said.

A reputable organisation such as the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer would normally publish results of such an important

study in a medical journal. Leakage of preliminary findings was regrettable.

“The stakes are very high. 100 people die of lung cancer every year.” Dr Roberts said tobacco industry earns a fortune.

He said the seven studies WHO (findings did not mean that passive smoking and lung cancer were directly linked.

“It merely means that risk is increased,” he said.

CLOSER President Dr Bill
Mullins said the study should be published in full so that it could be assessed prospectively.

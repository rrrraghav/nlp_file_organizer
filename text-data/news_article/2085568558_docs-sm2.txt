Small-biz owners fume
over Council’s ad ban

Small-business owners yesterday urged the City Council to reject a proposed ban on cigarette advertising near schools and gathering places for kids, arguing that it could snuff out their profits.

Advertising industry officials also criticized the measure, the law proposed by Council members Richard B. Stone (Manhattan) and Peter Vallone Jr. (Queens).

The Small Business Congress of New York said out-of-state revenue that goes to $30 million a year in state taxes and $15 million a year in city revenue would be lost if the ban is enacted. The group urged Council members to weigh the economic impact before “unreasonably burdening these 40,000 cigar-sellers.”

The Advertising Federation of America said the guarantees constitutional rights are being violated by the full commercial speech. “This type of restriction will do nothing to address the problem of underage smoking,” federation officials said in a strongly worded able message that New York City’s ban is hostile to advertising.

Vallone was unmoved by the lobbying. “We believe the placement of tobacco ads within 1,000 feet of schools, day care center or other places where children congregate is a prime cause of the youth in smoking,” he said.

Separately, consumer affairs officials yesterday announced they will seek to impose up to $1,000 fines on sellers for their cigarette literature and advertising violations. The measure targets retailers who violate city’s law against selling cigars to minors.

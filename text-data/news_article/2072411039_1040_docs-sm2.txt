NEW YORK - With urgent calls for more
regulation of cigarettes, Philip Morris Co.
admitted yesterday that smoking causes cancer
and other illnesses. The company’s move to keep
high-alerted consumers from lawsuits threatens the
tobacco industry's long-held position.

Philip Morris Inc. agreed to extend its marketing
campaign to warn about the dangers of smoking,
while also agreeing to pay $10 million over 25
years for a program to help smokers quit.

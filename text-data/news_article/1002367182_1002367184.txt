THE FOLLOWING IS NEWS RELEASE FROM FCC DATED 12-15-70

REPORT NO. 6605

BROADCASTERS CARRYING ANTI-SMOKING SPOTS MUST MAKE DETERMINATION
WHETHER CONTRARY VIEWS ARE REQUIPED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1971, FCC
RULES; DENIES CONTENTION BROADCASTERS MUST AIR SUCH VIEWS

WHEN A BROADCASTER CARRIES ANTI-SMOKING MESSAGES AFTER JANUARY 1,
1971, WHEN BROADCAST CIGARETTE COMMERCIALS WILL END UNDER THE 1969
LAW (PUBLIC LAW 91-273), IT IS UP TO HIM TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH,
REASONABLE JUDGMENT WHETHER HE HAS CAMPLED A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE
AND MUST PRESENT A CONTRAPOSTING VIEWPOINT. THE FCC HAS RULED IN A
PROCEEDING ON ITS REGULATORY POLICIES ON CIGARETTE SMOKING AND
BROADCASTING.

THE COMMISSION REJECTED THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE’S ARGUMENT THAT IN
SUCH A CASE THE BROADCASTER MUST PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE
VIEW THAT SMOKING MAY NOT BE HAZARDOUS TO HEALTH. ON THE CON-
TRARY, THE COMMISSION NOTED THAT SEVERAL BROADCASTERS HAVE CLAIMED
THAT THE GENERAL ISSUE OF SMOKING BEING A HEALTH HAZARD IS NO
LONGER CONTROVERSIAL AND SPECIFICALLY HELD THAT JUDGMENT
WAS REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMMISSION
ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE 1968 D. C. COURT OF APPEALS CASE,
BANZHAFF V. FCC, SUSTAINED THIS VIEW.

IN THE SAME ACTION, THE COMMISSION DISMISSED A REQUEST BY ACTION
ON SMOKING AND HEALTH (ASH) ASKING THAT RULES BE PROPOSED TO
REPRIZE LICENSEES TO DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO
ANTI-CIGARETTE SMOKING MATERIALS WHEN THERE HAS NO TIME TO
HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED. IT HELD THAT THERE WAS NO BASIS
SINGLE OUT THIS AREA FOR SUCH A RULE.

THE COMMISSION NOTED THAT FCC RULES SUPREME COURTS CASE,
NORTHERN VIRGINIA BROADCASTERS OF ALEXANDRIA, INCORPORATED V. FCC,
SUPPORTS THE COMMISSION’S POSITION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
COMMISSION MAY CONSIDER THE “TOTAL POINT” TO WHICH BROAD-
CASTERS DEVOTE ATTENTION TO A SUBJECT MATTER. THE COMMISSION
ALSO REJECTED ASH'S ARGUMENT THAT THE FCC HAS NOT ADEQUATELY
JUSTIFIED ITS REGULATORY POLICIES ON CIGARETTE SMOKING AND
BROADCASTING, FINDING THAT THE COMMISSION HAS EXHAUSTIVELY
CONSIDERED THIS ISSUE IN SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS. THE COMMISSION
ALSO REJECTED ASH’S REQUEST FOR A HEARING ON THIS MATTER.

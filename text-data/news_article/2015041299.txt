Tobacco giant hits
back at ‘Don’t
smoke' campaigns

CIGARETTE companies are starting to hit back at
increased anti-smoking propaganda by effecting
any published research they can find that could underm-
ine the now widely accepted view that smoking is
dangerous to health.

The giant Philip Morris states that “few and
limited studies” have been able to prove that smok-
ing induces scientifically valid fear, and that there-
are more fit than non-smokers. They dispute that smok-
ing causes cancer or heart disease, claiming that
there is no scientific evidence to support the idea.

A chest surgeon, from Cal-
ifornia, Dr. John A. Mc-
Laren, says that the statistical hazard
to smokers is not as great as
they may not necessarily, indeed,
cause the diseases they are said to.

In an introduction to a new
paper published by Philip
Morris, Mr. Ronald H. Thompson,
says from Mr. McLaren’s point of
view: “By no means
proved”

“There is no doubt that some
other tobacco ‘particularities’
are associated with cancer, heart disease and
other illnesses, but it has not been
shown to mean proved.”

The paper also states that
the evidence that smoking
causes lung cancer is
not conclusive.

The new study was spon-
sored by Imperial Tobacco Co., Inc.
and the British Medical Research
Council. It was supported by
the World Cancer Union and the
Danish Medical Council, that
smoking does not necessarily
were more prone to early death than
non-smokers.

The 1962 WHO published
study on lung cancer in the
developed world has shown a rise
in lung cancer and the rising
rate of myocardial infarcts and
other cardiovascular diseases.
Philip Morris states that this is
due to increased stress, pollu-
tion and diet, not necessarily
because it suggests that some vol-
untary smoking may be involved.

The paper also claims that
the link between smoking and
heart disease has not been estab-
lished beyond reasonable doubt.

“There is no scientific
evidence to prove that smok-
ing causes heart disease,” the
paper states. “It is possible
that other factors are involved.”

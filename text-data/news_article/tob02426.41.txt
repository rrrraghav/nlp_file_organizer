Smoking tied to 20 deaths each day, state reports

An average of 20 Wisconsin residents die each day from causes related to cigarette smoking, the state Division of Health reported Tuesday.

The cost of treating Wisconsin residents suffering from smoking-related illnesses was $303 million or about $535 for every smoker – the state report stated.

Dr. Patrick Remington, a Division of Health epidemiologist, said that heart disease, cancer, heart disease, lung disease and infant deaths that the conditions were caused by cigarette smoking.

He said smoking accounts for one death out of five in Wisconsin and that it caused an estimated 7,900 Wisconsin deaths in 1986.

Remington also estimated smoking caused 392 deaths in Dane County in 1986.

“Each year, more people die from smoking in this state than live in cities the size of Fox Point, Portage, Rhinelander, Rice Lake, Shawano or Sheboygan,” Remington said. “It’s a silent epidemic that rarely receives the attention it deserves in the media or in the public’s eye.”

His findings were published in the November issue of Wisconsin Medical Journal.

Remington used his smoking estimates from a computer program that factored the amount of illnesses doctors have reported.

The program was developed by Remington and colleagues at UW-Madison.

“It’s an estimate, for sure,” Remington said to reporter Mary Ann Moen. “But it gives us a handle on the magnitude of the problem.”

Remington said 12 to 14 percent of Wisconsin deaths are attributable to cigarette smoking.

The report is based on data from the state health services and vital statistics sections.

$26,000,000 STUDY
OF SMOG PROPOSED

Five-Year U.S. Survey Asked—
Federal Aid to Localities
Envisioned in Program

Special to The New York Times.
WASHINGTON, July 11 — A
$26,000,000 five-year study of
air pollution was proposed today by inter-
departmental Federal committee
created last December.

The President has asked Miss
Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare,
to make a report to him on the
study’s feasibility. Congress-
men have expressed concern over
smog troubles.

The proposed $26,000,000 study
would be much broader in scope
than the $1,500,000 survey now
being directed by Dr. William A.
Campbell, Public Health Service
Representative.

This bill has passed the House
and is before the Senate Banking
Committee. It provides for a
study of air pollution’s effect on
health and welfare, its relation-
ship to industrial activity, and
ways to reduce it. The study also
would investigate the effects of
air pollution on crops, forests,
wildlife, and materials.

The committee said that the
study would be conducted by a
Federal agency or agencies with
the assistance of State and local
agencies.

Permanent Group Urged

The committee recommended
that the proposed anti-pollution
program be administered by the
Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare, with the
assistance of a permanent inter-
departmental group to co-ordi-
nate the work of Federal agencies
that participate in the program.

It defined “community air pol-
lution” as “the presence of dust,
smoke or fumes in relation to
industrial activity.”

The process of air pollution
“is not necessarily a matter of
concentration directly or indirectly
affecting human health or de-
teriorating the environment.”

The committee’s statement con-
tinued: "In general, it does not refer to
the presence of dust, smoke or
fumes in employment in areas
where they are considered an
agent of communicable disease or
of war."

The responsibilities of the
states and localities and the
Federal Government in coping
with defined by the committee.
It said that the Federal Govern-
ment is responsible for assisting
in air pollution to its report
on “the prevention of smog and
local government.”

The committee’s report also
suggested that a national con-
ference on air pollution be held
to bring together officials from
Federal, State, and local agen-
cies.

The committee was created by
President Eisenhower last Decem-
ber to study the problem of air
pollution in metropolitan areas.
It is composed of representatives
of the Departments of Health,
Education and Welfare; Interi-
or; Commerce; Agriculture; and
the Public Health Service.

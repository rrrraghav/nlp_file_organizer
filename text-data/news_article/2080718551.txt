Tracy uses strategy at Long Beach GP

By Dave Bosworth
Tracy’s driving a box-like Chevy, Paul Tracy was determined to make it count.
He did, finishing seventh in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. It wasn't a win, but it was a solid performance for the Marlboro Team Penske driver, who had started 17th.
Tracy’s strategy was to wait and see what other drivers would do. He didn’t want to get caught up in any early-race incidents.
“We just wanted to be there at the end,” Tracy said. “I knew we could make something happen.”
The race started with a field of 32 cars, but only 25 finished. There were several cautions and one major wreck that took out six cars on lap 10.
Tracy’s pit crew was quick in the pits, which helped him gain positions during the cautions.
“They did a great job,” Tracy said. “I couldn’t have asked for anything better.”

The wreck involved several cars and sent debris across the track.
“It was a mess,” Tracy said. “You didn’t want to be anywhere near it.”

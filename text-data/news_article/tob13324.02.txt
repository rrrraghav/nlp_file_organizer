Bill only gives

appearances of regulating vending

To the Editor:

For all those interested in
protecting the health of
children and adolescents, there
is good news and not so news.
The good news is that
Shawnee and other Minnesota
communities have passed
ordinances that will prevent sale
of cigarettes to minors by
regulating cigarette vending
machines. The bad news is
making it obvious now
children viewed fatalistic daily
news reports of young smokers
and life viewd cigarettes were
harmful, but they weren’t
subject to peer pressures.

But regulations are not
sufficient. The new local
ordinances are a good start,
but all the power rests with
government. Best of all they
don't address the real problem.
Now for the bad news. The
cigarette industry profits and
understand how people and
teenagers are addicted to it,
it is desperate to stop. So, with
the help of lobbyists and
legislators, they have drafted
a bill that will allow cigarette
vending machines to remain in
operation as long as they are
attended by an adult.

The legislators involved
in drafting this bill seem to
have forgotten their oath to
protect the health and safety
of Minnesotans. They appear
to be more interested in pleasing
the tobacco industry than in
protecting our children.

This bill, HF 2943, is a
sham. It gives the appearance
of regulating vending machines,
but it does nothing to prevent
minors buying cigarettes, why
shouldn’t they have the right to
buy them from an unattended
vending machine sales?

It allows tobacco companies
and blatant storage to maintain
their presence in our communities
paying lip service to preventing
access by minors. If this bill
our state legislature allows this,
it will be a sad day for
responsible government and bad
news for the health of Minnesota’s
Minnesotans. The Minnesota
Association and others are
opposed to this legislation.

And what state legislator is
going to vote for this bill?
and prefer its own tobacco lobby
to protecting children from
teenagers? None other than
Representative Harold
Schreier, of St. Paul, a member
of the House Bill.

I urge all Minnesotans to
outraged and should call or write
their state legislators and take
their opportunity to vote No HF
2943 and support legislation that
effectively “machine restricting
access by minors and prevent local
communities from doing so.

Shawnee residents should do
so by contacting their state
legislators, Representative Harold
Schreier, of St. Paul, and
Senator Dean Johnson, who is
responsible for the bill in the
Senate. They can be reached at
400 State Capitol, St. Paul, MN
55155 or call 651-296-2184.

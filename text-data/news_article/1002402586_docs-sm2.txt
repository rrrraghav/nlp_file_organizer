Several things will live—or rather, die—on the 5-cent level.  The 5-cent store is one of them.  The 5-cent chewing gum company is another.  It’s hard to imagine a world without either.

We are so far away from the days when everything was five cents that it seems almost impossible to believe that anything will stay at that price.  But Wrigley, the chewing gum man, has done it.  He has kept his prices at 5 cents for three generations.  It’s a remarkable record.

Wrigley started in Chicago in 1891 with a small candy store. His biggest selling items were strips of licorice and chocolate. He sold them with packages of gum.  He soon realized that the gum was doing all the business. So he switched to selling only gum.

Then, in 1893, Wrigley had an idea. He would give away a package of gum with every two bars of soap he sold.  That’s how he started his chewing gum business.  He bought a soap factory and began making soap.  He advertised it widely.  People bought the soap to get the free gum.

The soap business was good, but Wrigley wanted to expand. He decided to manufacture his own soap.  He built a new factory and hired more men.  He sold more soap and gave away more gum.  His chewing gum sales increased rapidly.

Wrigley had a problem. He needed a way to promote his product. He thought of advertising in newspapers, but he didn’t want to spend too much money. So he decided to put his name on the wrappers of his gum. That was his first advertisement.

The Wrigley Company has grown into one of the largest manufacturers of chewing gum in the world.  It sells its products all over the country and in many foreign countries.  Wrigley is a shrewd businessman. He knows how to make money. And he’s not afraid to take risks.

He has always been willing to invest in new ventures.  He built hotels, ball parks, and other projects.  He has also given millions of dollars to charity. Wrigley is a philanthropist as well as a businessman.

The 5-cent price of chewing gum is partly because it’s the way they were marketed early on. So he switched to selling only gum. That was a good move. People like chewing gum. It's a refreshing treat.  It helps to clean your teeth. And it’s cheap.

A sea of baking powder and soap. Wrigley realized that people wanted both. He started giving away packages of gum with every two bars of soap he sold. The company has been very successful in promoting its product.  Wrigley is a legend. His name is synonymous with chewing gum.  He has made a fortune. And he’s given millions to charity.

The Wrigley Company has been around for many years. It has weathered many storms. But it has always remained true to its principles. The company believes in quality. It believes in honesty. And it believes in the 5-cent price.

Wrigley is a man of his word. He said he would keep his prices at 5 cents, and he has done so.  He has been praised for his integrity. He has been criticized for his stubbornness. But he hasn’t changed.

The Wrigley Company is an institution. It's part of the American landscape. It’s a symbol of our heritage. And it’s a reminder of a simpler time.

Wrigley is a man who understands people. He knows what they want. And he gives it to them.  He has been successful because he has always put his customers first.

The Wrigley Company is a family business. It's run by members of the Wrigley family. They are dedicated to preserving the company’s values. They believe in quality. They believe in honesty. And they believe in the 5-cent price.

Wrigley is a man who has made a difference in the world. He has created jobs. He has supported charities. And he has brought joy to millions of people. Wrigley is an American hero.

The Wrigley Company is a testament to the power of perseverance. It’s a reminder that anything is possible if you work hard and believe in yourself. The company is a symbol of hope. And it’s a source of pride for all Americans.

The 5-cent price of chewing gum is a tradition. It's something that we cherish. It's part of our identity. And it’s not going to change anytime soon.

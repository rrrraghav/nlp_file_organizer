Mr. Joseph Tcheng, Vice President, Philip Morris Asia, wishes to announce the following changes in the Taiwan market effective November 1, 1999.

Mr. Goddard Kwong is appointed National Sales Manager, reporting to Mr. Anthony Lau, General Manager, Taiwan. Goddard is a seasoned sales professional who has extensive experience in the markets of PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan. He joined Philip Morris in 1973 and has held a variety of responsible positions, including General Manager for the PRC and most recently Director of Sales Development for Greater China. Goddard and his family will relocate to Taipei.

Mr. Karl Hsu, who is currently Sales & Planning Manager, has chosen to leave Philip Morris in order to pursue other career opportunities. Karl joined Philip Morris Taiwan in 1989 and has played a key role in managing the finance and administration functions before taking up his current position in 1996. Most recently Karl was a key member of a task force team that completed a smooth transition of the sales force from Tait to McClane, our new distributor.

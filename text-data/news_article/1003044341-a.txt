CIGARETTE CONCERN WINS CASE

KANSAS CITY, MO., July 11
(AP) - A Federal Court jury today found the Philip Morris Company was not liable for a cancer contracted by a smoker.

John T. Ross, 62, of Independence, had sued for $250,000.

He lost his voice box and other organs of his throat in an operation for the removal of a cancer in 1952. He contended his long and excessive smoking of Philip Morris cigarettes had “caused” the cancer.

The attorney had argued that Philip Morris had implied a warning in its advertising, which had been negligent in warning that smoking could cause cancer.

Norman Knuth, foreman of the jury, said the jury felt medical science could better determine whether or not cigarettes caused cancer.

The case was tried before Federal Judge Herbert Gaul.

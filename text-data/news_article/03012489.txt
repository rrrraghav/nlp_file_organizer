NEWS RELEASE
"KENT II REFORMULATION/COUPON PROMOTION

Advertising
Coupon Promotion for Kent

BY PHILLIP B. DOUGHERTY

Next month, Lorillard will distribute
50 million coupons, each good on
the purchase of a carton of its reformu-
lated Kent cigarettes.

Having gotten through test markets
in two Portland’s (Oregon and Maine)
and in Fresno, the new “Kent II”
Micronite II filter went national in Sep-
tember. The advertising for the
brand has gotten in 17 months.

The campaign, which includes print,
magazines, outdoor and transit and the
theme of "It's rough," has been backed
with 35 percent of its first year’s $20
million budget. The coupons will be dis-
tributed through ads in Sunday news-
papers.

The priced money that wasn’t
behind Kent was backing “New-
port,” with only a slight product
shift.

Lorillard spent about $15 million in
the first year on Kent, and the ad
drive had to be cut back consider-
ably after the test markets showed
that the target audience—smokers
who take themselves seriously—didn’t
respond to the advertising.

“We were trying to appeal to a group
of people who are not easily appealed
to,” said John W. Kelly, Lorillard’s
advertising director. “We wanted to
appeal to people who think they know
better.”

The company is now attempting to
appeal to that same audience by try-
ing to make them feel like they’re in
on a secret. The coupons are designed
to look like handwritten notes, and the
copy on the ads reads as if it were
written by someone who doesn't want
to be caught smoking Kent.

“We’re trying to appeal to people
who are not easily appealed to,” Mr.
Kelly said. “We wanted to make them
feel like they’re in on a secret.”

The company is also attempting
to take a more sophisticated approach
to advertising, which it hopes will
appeal to smokers who are tired of
seeing ads that try to tell them how
to live their lives.

are not easily appealed to,” Mr. Kelly
said. “We wanted to make them feel
like they’re in on a secret.”

Marketing Showcase Inc., publisher
of the Sunday newspaper insert, it has
found it is a partial solution to the
problem. It is introducing coded cou-
pons with sequential numbers; if a
store finds that too many unredeemed
coupons, which normal supply
chains would not handle, suddenly
honky-dory becomes the obvious
answer.

B&B Gets Legal Coffee

Boston & Bowles, which has General
Foods as a major client in the United
States and Britain, has just lost
and that company to the client list
of J. Walter Thompson, its rival. It
is a legal pot, of course, be brewed
in a legal pot.

People

Martin Bowen and Burt Founders have
been named senior vice presidents of
McCaffrey & McCaffrey.

William H. Biddle III is president of ABC
Publishing Company Inc.

John A. Donahue is a new executive
vice president of Ogilvy, Adams & Rine-
hart.

Vision Enterprises has promoted
George W. Knorr to vice president and
director of marketing.

Lorillard’s advertising campaign
is aimed at making converts of the
15 million smokers who will “ill
take a chance” on trying cigarettes
and discovering that the current
brand preferences of the current
smoker are wrong.

Other statistics that might be help-
ful: 40 percent of all cigarette con-
sumers there and 40 educating a
pack, or about one-third a day’s con-
sumes a pack and a third a day. 365
days a year.

G.F. and TV Violence

General Foods has been working on
a system for translating TV programs
into symbols that can be understood
by broadcasting, the organization that
is responsible for rating television
shows was offered in sponsoring
Kent II with the plant company’s
advertising. The goal is to give parents
to take a chance on knowing what
their children are watching and to
give children a chance on knowing
what their parents are watching.

The system, which has been under de-
velopment for 18 months, will be tested
in several cities next month. It will
be available to television stations free
of charge.

“We think it’s important that par-
ents have a way of knowing what their
children are watching,” said Robert J.
Morse, General Foods’ vice president
for marketing. “We also think it’s im-
portant that children have a way of
knowing what their parents are watch-
ing.”

The system will use a series of sym-
bols to indicate the level of violence
in a program. The symbols will be dis-
played in the corner of the screen dur-
ing the program.

“We think it’s important that par-
ents have a way of knowing what their
children are watching,” said Mr. Morse.
“We also think it’s important that chil-
dren have a way of knowing what their
parents are watching.”

The nation's largest tobacco
company offered Wednesday to back sweeping legislation to curb
tobacco sales and advertising, if
the government drops efforts to
regulate cigarettes.

The bid was met by a luke-
warm reception in Washington,
where a White House spokesman
said it “falls a little bit short” of
President Clinton’s goals.

Philip Morris' proposal
would ban vending machine and
store displays of tobacco products.

The maker of Marlboro also
would seek a ban on all outdoor
advertising of tobacco products
within 1,000 feet of schools, play-
grounds and sporting events.

All cigarette advertising would
be prohibited on trains, buses
subways and taxis.

“We feel this comprehensive
plan in the hope that all sides in
the debate will set aside their
differences and work together so that we can work
together to solve this,” Philip Morris
spokesman Steven Parrish said.

The plan would make it a fed-
eral crime to sell cigarettes to
people under 18.

But Philip Morris said it would
support the legislation only if the
Food and Drug Administration is
precluded from having jurisdic-
tion over virtually all tobacco
products. The only exception
would be for products that involv-
ing a health claim.

The FDA has proposed declar-
ing that cigarettes are a drug-
delivery device, and therefore
subject to its jurisdiction.

In Washington, Clinton spokes-
man Mike McCurry said: “It falls
a little bit short of the standards
the president has set out. We
would welcome further efforts by
Philip Morris and others in the
industry to meet the standards
we have set forth.”

Philip Morris was joined in its
announcement by United States
Tobacco Co., which makes
small-majorities tobacco products. The
other major cigarette companies
expressed modest support.

On Wall Street, Philip Morris
stock slipped 11% cents to $91 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

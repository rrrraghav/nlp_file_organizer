Secondhand smoke bans
based on second-rate science

84

Anyone who hasn’t been mau-
led by a deep stand for
the past 30 years or so
knows that smoking is un-
healthy. Scientists tell us they
have found a statistically
significant link between smoking
and lung cancer, and other ills.
Before the Surgeon General’s
warning, cigarettes weren’t called
cigarettes; they were “coffin nails.”
Now, would you think, then, that
the Arizona Health Department's
anti-smoking campaign, titled
“It is no rumor-saying, tell-
ing,” would be a surprise?
Recent data indicate that as
many as 25 percent more lung can-
cer than non-smokers.

The problem with the anti-
smoking crusade is that it’s
based on second-rate science.
When secondhand smoke mount-
ed, back in 1963, all there was
was a vague complaint about
the unpleasant smell of smoke and
the watery eyes of those near-
by. The Environmental Protec-
or ETS, as it’s called – is a
hazard. The Environmen-
tal Protection Agency try to
find a causal link, but they did
that gave credence to the theory that
secondhand smoke is dangerous. A re-
luminous document, “Hazardous
Substances in the Workplace,” was
the most influential report ever ti-
tled by the agency.

It led to bans on smoking in most
workplaces and restaurants. The

The EPA report has produced a
public nuisance, but it’s also a
source of revenue for businesses
seeking to advertise that they
offer a sidewalk area where
smokers can indulge and stress.

The EPA report was based on 30 epide-
miological studies that factored in
a link between ETS and lung cancer.
“mainly by comparing disease rates
among women living with smokers
and non-smokers,” says William
Rappaport, a statistician who
has an association, but only if it poses
a statistically significant risk.
Nine of the studies, in fact,
found that women who smoke were
associated with a “slight” risk of
lung cancer. The EPA conveniently
expanded the definition of statistical
significance, in effect doubling the
odds, and then claimed that studies
were statistical significance.

The study found that 1 in 5
women who live with a smoker is
at increased risk of developing
non-cancer as a woman living with a
smoker. It’s a scientific stand-
ard that would make even the most
zealous epidemiologist consider an
attack. But it isn't. If 1 in 5
women who live with a smoker is at
risk, then 4 in 5 women who don’t
live with a smoker aren’t at risk.
That’s not how science works.

The EPA report was based on studies
that were conducted by people who
were predisposed to finding a link
between ETS and lung cancer.
William R. Shank, an epidemiologist
at the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, says that “the evidence is
not convincing.”



40 Years Ago

Smoking was allowed in restau-
rants, bars, airplanes, trains,
buses, taxis, hospitals, schools,
courtrooms and government build-
ings. Smoking was even allowed
in operating rooms.

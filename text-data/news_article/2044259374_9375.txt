CAN GOVT STOP KIDS’ SMOKING?
Friends, Family More Helpful When Kicking Habit

Smokin' in the boys' room
seems back in vogue again.

A widely reported University of
Michigan study found a 24% rise in
smoking among eighth-graders. It
has prompted calls for President
Clinton’s team to make a new
effort to regulate tobacco and
kid access to it.

The Food and Drug Administration
head, David Kessler, says
the FDA had the power to regulate
tobacco. He cited a 1992 Justice
Department opinion of Kennedy
Administration that said tobacco
would go the way of smallpox and
polio.

His lofty goal and the campaigns to
stop kids’ smoking, though,
have failed.

Government efforts to fight social ills
have a poor track record. As Milton
Friedman once said, “attempts to
shape society tend to fail.”

And as smoking use increases among
youngsters, it is more often
done clandestinely.

But what if kids are more open
about their habit? It’s more difficult
to control.

It is also a matter of parental
influence. A recent study by the
National Cancer Institute found that
kids with parents who smoke are
three times as likely to start smoking
themselves.

“The most important thing is for
parents to not smoke,” says Dr.
Joseph DiFuria, director of adolescent
medicine at St. Luke’s Hospital in
Bethlehem, Pa. “If they do, they
need to be honest with their kids about
it.”

According to the study, 40% of teens
smoke, and 30% of those who smoke
started before age 13.

The University of Michigan study
found that 27% of eighth-graders
have tried cigarette smoking and 19%
currently smoke.

“We’ve seen a resurgence in
cigarette smoking and marijuana use
are very highly correlated,” said
Johnston, who is also an economist.
“It’s not just about cigarettes. If
juveniles want to smoke marijuana,
they need to learn how to take
risks. Cigarette smoking is a risk-
taking sport for anyone. Cigarettes
are the gateway.”

The Michigan data may overstate
the problem. Many kids are not habitual
smokers.

What does a current smoker differ
between adults and children? A child is
more likely to have started smoke
store opportunities in the past 30 days.

Adults, on the other hand, are smok-
ers when they have smoked 100 cig-

“The problem isn’t just cigarettes,”
said Johnston. “It’s about risk-taking.”

parents who smoke are three times as

“It’s about peer pressure,” said
Dr. DiFuria. “Kids want to fit in, and
smoking is one way they think they can
do that.”

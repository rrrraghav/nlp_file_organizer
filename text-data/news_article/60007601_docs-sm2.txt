Twin Sees Herself Stymied

BY GINA KOLATA

B most objective ideas, Dr. Julie A. Swain is, like her twin sister, a stun-
ner.

She is the chief of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Nevada
School of Medicine, a member of the Food and Drug Administration com-
mittee that evaluates new devices,
a member of the Health Care 
Policy committee that devel-
ops guidelines for medical care, and
a member of the Defense Depart-
ment’s peer-review committee for
gun assurance.

A decade ago, when she was at
the first woman to be chief of cardi-
ovascular surgery at a major medi-
school. And like her sister, she
is driven by an almost obsessive
career. She, like her sister, wants to
be the best, and to her, the best is a
position as chief of cardiology at a
major medical center, something no
woman has achieved in this country. 

Her failure to reach her goal is not
for lack of trying. Dr. Swain
typically works from 6:30 in the
morning until well past midnight, she
voiced and has no children, and she
lives alone in Reno.

And, apparently, it is not for lack
of talent. Dr. Michael DeBakey, the
eminent heart surgeon at Baylor
College of Medicine, said she
“is one of the best surgeons I’ve
ever met.”

He agrees that “it's important to
have women in surgery,” but he adds
that he would not want his daughter to
ability to succeed at the very top," 
he said. "She is a brilliant surgeon,
but she has a problem with people."

Dr. Swain’s sister, Dr. Mary E.
Swain, is the chief of nephrology at
the University of Washington Medi-
cal Center in Seattle. She, too, is
a highly regarded physician and
researcher. 

“Julie is very talented,” said Dr.
Mary Swain. “She’s a brilliant sur-
geon, but she doesn't always get
along with people.”

Dr. Julie Swain acknowledges that
she has difficulty relating to others.
"I am not a warm and fuzzy per-
son," she said. "I don’t care about
people’s feelings. I care about do-
ing my job well."

She says her colleagues often com-
plaint that she is arrogant, impatient
and insensitive. 

“They think I am difficult to work
with,” Dr. Swain said. “And they are
right.”

Dr. Swain’s bluntness and lack of
tact have cost her opportunities.
Several hospitals have turned down
her applications for the position of
chief of cardiology, saying that their
doctors will not send their patients to a
“difficult” surgeon. 

"The probably will be a woman
president of surgery at a major medical
school," she said.

Dr. Stephen E. Epstein, chief of
cardiology at the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute in Bethes-
da, Md., who has worked with Dr.
Swain, said that “she is an excel-
surgeon” and that "she did a 
wonderful job" at the University of
Nevada School of Medicine.

He agrees that the heart surgery is
a man’s world, but he adds that “it’s
getting better.”

“There are still barriers for women
that a helpful innovator like Julie
has to overcome,” Dr. Epstein said.
“But I think she will do it.”

Dr. Swain says she has no inten-
tion of changing her personality. 
"I am who I am," she said. "If you
don’t like it, don’t work with me."

Clean Politics

In my view, Proposition 5 doesn’t go far enough. We are really serious about air pollution control, I think we should attack the problem areas as reasonably possible and quickly as possible.

Why not, for example, require that all persons who use public transportation (buses, trains, etc.) carry an “in person proof” that they have had a negative tuberculosis test within six hours prior to boarding said form of transport? Or require that all airport security staff they are medically allergic to soap and water?

Also, why not require that be imposed on persons riding elevators or escalators who must use a mask or be used an approved mouthwash within 30 minutes before having consumed taken of foods known to produce gas or alcohol (including but not limited to vodka) in the previous 24 hours.

The possibilities are almost limitless and hardly a ripple on the surface.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Escondido Mayor Doug Best today announced his support of
Californians for Common Sense in the battle to defeat the
smoking prohibitions initiative -- Proposition 5 -- on the
November ballot.

"The burden on California taxpayers has reached the limit,"
Mayor Best said. "The smoking prohibitions proposition on our
November ballot will place an additional $43 million burden on
local and state taxpayers in the first year, to pay for an
enormous system of expensive signs, law enforcement and court costs.
"This additional tax load is neither justified nor necessary.

I am supporting the Californians for Common Sense campaign to
defeat this needless and costly initiative."

Co-chairmen of Californians for Common Sense, the organization
campaigning for defeat of Proposition 5, are Katherine B. Dunlap,
prominent conservationist and civic leader, Houston I. Flournoy,
dean of the University of Southern California Center for Public
Affairs, and John F. Henning, executive secretary-treasurer of
the California Labor Federation (AFL-CIO).

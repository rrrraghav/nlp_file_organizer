One Man Has the Last Word

A former associate of an organized crime family told Senate investigators yesterday that the Mafia has infiltrated bingo operations on several Indian reservations in large-scale games to raise money.

The witness, who asked to be testified, fit disputed evidence given by a senior FBI official who said the Mafia had been involved in organized crime has yet to become “a substantial and consistent threat” on the nation’s reservations.

“I don’t think they’re a threat,” said the witness told the investigations subcommittee of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs. “They are getting out information.”

The witness described a large bingo hall on a reservation in the West where he estimated the Mafia skimmed $20,000 to $70,000 through its profits that belonged to organized years.

Speaking through a system that electronically altered his voice, the witness said that the Mafia’s involvement extended from Arizona and New Mexico to Nevada, California and Michigan. Bingo halls are run by tribes as a source of revenue.

The witness said he began working for the Mafia in 1978 and continued until 1982. He was arrested on gambling charges in 1983.

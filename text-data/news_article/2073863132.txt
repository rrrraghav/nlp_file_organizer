Headline Maryland Children’s Initiative Announces 1999 Rally

News The Maryland Children's Initiative (MCI) has announced that they will host a rally February 15, 1999 at the Naval-Marine Stadium, in Annapolis, Maryland, to raise awareness of the groups campaign to raise the State’s cigarette tax by $1.50 per pack over three years.

From SmokeFree Maryland's material: "Raising the tobacco tax is a good thing for Maryland for the following reasons:"

  * Tobacco use is the #1 killer of Marylanders!
  * 90% of adult smokers began smoking as teenagers. Smoking among teens is on the rise in Maryland.
  * Tobacco-related death and disease cost us plenty—Over $1.5 billion each year in Maryland alone.
  * Significantly raising the tobacco tax is the single most effective way to reduce tobacco use."

Note: In September, we were asked to research MCI. In our continuing attention to this group, we thought you would want to be aware of this event.

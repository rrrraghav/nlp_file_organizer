George V. Allen Says

U.S. Trade At Crossroads

Washington -- A common market of the Atlantic area, with full United
States participation, is necessary to sustain business expansion in
today’s world, George V. Allen, president of the Tobacco Institute, told an
audience at the annual Congressional dinner of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce Tuesday
night at the Hotel Washington.

Mr. Allen, who is also chairman of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization and has served as ambassador to five
nations and as director of the U.S. Information Agency, declared that the
United States is at the crossroads and must make its decision.

Recounting the beginning of U.S. industry and commerce with the
harvesting of John Rolfe’s first tobacco crop in the starving Jamestown,
Virginia, Colony in 1612, Mr. Allen said:

“The U.S. could still lose the battle for survival, the seeds of which
were planted at Jamestown 350 years ago and have flourished up to the present.”

The decision whether the U.S. economy is to go forward or recede is before
Congress at the present time...

"Jamestown found its means of survival through trade. Without it the
colony would have quickly withered on the vine. The more free trade
area of the U.S. has expanded -- now embracing 50 states -- the greater the
economic development and standard of living becomes. It is perfectly obvious
to me that the future lies in further expanding that area to embrace the

principal industrialized nations of the world which lie around the basin of the
North Atlantic, taking in Western Europe, the United States and Canada.

THE WORLD

World population slows

WASHINGTON – World population
growth has slowed significantly since
the early 1960s, a report says. It is
that many have started with the discovery
of birth control pills in 1960, according
to the World Institute said Wednesday.
The rate of growth will continue to
change birth rates and a global trend to-
ward smaller families, but the current
estimates indicate that at this rate it
has increased about 40 million and
the population is now 4 billion.
India, China and Indonesia are the
biggest, the report says, but
Japan and Hong Kong have
rates of 2.1%

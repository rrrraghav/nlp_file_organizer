RTf 04/13 1855 U.S. Congress panel to hear tobacco CEOs testify

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Reuters) - The top executives of the biggest
tobacco companies are scheduled to testify Thursday before a Congressional
panel led by one of the industry’s toughest critics on Capitol Hill.
Chairmen, presidents, and chief executive officers representing the
six big cigarette makers and a smokeless tobacco company, appear before
California Democrat Henry Waxman, who has accused the industry of
manipulating nicotine levels to keep smokers addicted and then lying about
it.

Waxman said such high level officers have never appeared in such a
setting.

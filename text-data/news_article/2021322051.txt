Comline News Service, Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun (COM/LN, NKOGS) - January 26, 1993, Page: 11

ABSTRACT:

Toshiba Corp. is aiming to double its sales of chip mounting systems to 8.5 billion yen (US$68.0 million) in fiscal 1993. Demand for mounting systems from US makers is recovering quickly, prompting Toshiba to launch an effort to aggressively market its “MH-S200.” a chip mounting system developed with Japan Tobacco, Inc. last year which achieves a mounting speed of 0.125 second/chip. Toshiba plans to release a medium-speed double-sided mounting system and another system featuring image processing functions to expand its product line-up to meet diversifying user needs as a rise in demand picks up momentum. Toshiba’s fiscal 1994 sales target is set at 10 billion yen (US$80.0 million).

Closings exaggerated, VA chief says... A congressman’s contention that startling 410 billion for a NASA
project will force closure of Veterans Administration hospitals isn't
true, the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs said Thursday.
“We have no plans whatsoever to close any VA hospitals,”
said Secretary Edward J. Derwinski. Rep. Harley O. Staggers,
D-W.Va., said last week he was told by Appropriations Subcommittee
Chairman Bob Traxler, D-Mich., that the NASA appropriation
"certain would mean less money for VA medical services.” The fear
will not materialize this year when VA hospitals are forced to shut
down,” Staggers said.

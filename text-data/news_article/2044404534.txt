Marlboro’s
ads attacked





Many youths join Burlington protests

A Philip Morris USA Marlboro promotion case under fire
from a group of about 40
protesters in Burlington.

Opposition to the tobacco giant's "Can You Summer" campaign, which began last week, Monday,
was voiced by protesters who gathered outside the company’s
efforts to promote cigarettes to young people.

A Marlboro van arrived, about
10:30 a.m., and drew a crowd
from about 50 people outside the
Marlboro store on North Ave-
nue. The van used fresh den-
im to appeal to cigarette
buyers.

“Clear up your lungs,” said
one protester, “or stop smoking.”
The Marlboro van was parked
near a group of Burlington High
School students who were
skipping class to protest.

Store owner Clarence Campbell,
said cigarette buyers far proof
of age are checked carefully.
"We've had no problems," said
Campbell. "We’re just trying to
provide a service."

“We do not believe the owners should
take responsibility, but their
advertising is irresponsible,” said
one protester. “They’re not
directing this at the owner; we’re
protesting directed toward 40
promotions.”

"We're concerned about the
organizes her efforts," said
Karen Davis, a Philip Morris
spokeswoman. said the promotion
is aimed at adults in other
part of land country.

“I think you can misunderstand
that,” said one protester. “That
kids should smoke or have access to
cigarettes.”

Davis said "This plan is to
give young people a chance to
live about brand loyalty and trying
to get them to switch over to our brands."

Although no minors tried to get
cigarettes, protesters said younger
than 18.

“Age-wise I’ve agreed too long,”
said Ashley Johnson, a Burlington High
School student. “I'm not going to
be used as an advertisement.”

Johnson and other students
were protesting the Marlboro
promotion, which they say is
targeting young people.

"We're trying to make a point,"
said Johnson. "We’re trying to
make them realize that we are
not going to be their puppets."

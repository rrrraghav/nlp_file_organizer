Smoking: Clearing Away the Haze

By DAYA SOBEL

M in a boudoiry that doubles as a laboratory, Ms. Sobel sits smoking.
She can’t help it, she says. She is studying herself.
Ms. Sobel, who has to use a plastic container so her smoke doesn't interfere with the equipment,
has attached sensors to her body to monitor every puff and record all of it on a computer.
“I want to understand what happens when you inhale,” she explained. “I want to know
Richard Hemmsted is watching her.

It’s difficult to imagine anyone who hasn't
understood the reasons behind banning cigarettes.
But the American public still smokes,
including the Surgeon General’s office.
“The problem isn’t that people don’t know it’s bad,” said Dr. Hemmsted, an individual smoker
who has devoted his life to studying tobacco. “It’s that they like it.”

He is working with Ms. Sobel on a project called the “Smoking Behavior Study,” funded by the
American Heart Association and designed to understand why people smoke and how to help them stop.
The study, which began last year, involves 100 smokers who are monitored for several hours each week.
Ms. Sobel’s work is part of a broader effort to understand addiction, which scientists now believe
involves complex biochemical processes in the brain.

“We used to think that people smoked because they were nervous or bored,” said Dr. Hemmsted. “But
we know now that there are powerful neurochemical rewards associated with smoking.”

The study is also examining the effects of nicotine on various aspects of behavior, including mood,
memory and attention. Ms. Sobel’s sensors measure her heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature
and brain activity as she smokes. The data is then analyzed by a computer program that can identify
patterns and correlations.

“We’re looking for the ‘signatures’ of smoking,” said Ms. Sobel. “What happens in the body when
someone takes a puff? What are the physiological responses?”

The study has already yielded some surprising findings. For example, Ms. Sobel found that smokers
experience a temporary increase in alertness and concentration after smoking a cigarette, even though
they know it’s bad for them.

“It’s like a little reward,” she said. “They get a brief boost of energy and focus, which reinforces
the habit.”

The study is also exploring the role of social factors in smoking behavior. Smokers are often influenced
by their peers, family members and cultural norms. Ms. Sobel is interviewing smokers to understand
their motivations for smoking and their experiences with quitting.

“It’s not just about the nicotine,” she said. “It’s about the whole ritual of smoking – the smell, the taste,
the feeling of holding a cigarette.”

The Smoking Behavior Study is part of a larger effort to reduce tobacco use in the United States. The
federal government has implemented various measures to discourage smoking, including raising taxes on
cigarettes and banning smoking in public places. However, these efforts have not been entirely successful.

“We need to understand why people smoke so we can develop more effective strategies for helping them quit,”
said Dr. Hemmsted. “It’s a complex problem with no easy solutions.”

The study is also examining the effects of different types of cigarettes on smoking behavior. Some
cigarettes contain higher levels of nicotine than others, and these may be more addictive. Ms. Sobel
is testing various brands of cigarettes to see how they affect her physiology and mood.

“We’re trying to understand the relationship between cigarette composition and smoking behavior,” she said.
“It’s possible that some cigarettes are more ‘dangerous’ than others.”

The Smoking Behavior Study is a long-term project, and Ms. Sobel and Dr. Hemmsted expect to continue
their research for several years. They hope their findings will help public health officials develop more
effective strategies for reducing tobacco use and improving the health of Americans.

“We’re not trying to tell people what to do,” said Ms. Sobel. “We’re just trying to understand why they do
what they do.”

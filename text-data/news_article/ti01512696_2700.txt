The Tobacco Institute
Scope and Activities

What The Tobacco Institute Is...

The Tobacco Institute is a nonprofit, noncommercial
organization founded in 1958. Its members are thirteen
companies which manufacture cigarettes and other tobacco
products in the United States. The Institute welcomes
all inquiries on topics relevant to tobacco and to The
Institute’s activities.

What it does…

The responsibilities of The Tobacco Institute are
similar to those of many other industry or professional
associations. The aim of The Institute is to increase
awareness of the historic role of tobacco and its place
in the national economy, and to foster public
understanding of issues relating to tobacco --
including, for example, taxation, environmental tobacco
smoke and its role in indoor air quality, advertising
and sales restrictions. The Institute is a communicator
of information and viewpoints on these and other
matters, to the public, the news media, and government

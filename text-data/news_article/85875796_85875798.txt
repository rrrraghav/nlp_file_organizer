New Arms Deal Linked to Early Change in Soviet Policy



By ROBERT SEMPLE Special to The New York Times
WEST BERLIN, July 12 — Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev has made a significant concession to West Germany, agreeing to allow the East German Government to sign an agreement on compensation for property lost during World War II.

The concession, announced today by both East and West German officials, is linked to a new Soviet arms deal with East Germany that includes advanced surface-to-air missiles and other sophisticated weaponry.

Western diplomats here believe that Khrushchev’s willingness to compromise on the property claims—a long-standing irritant in relations between East and West Germany—is an indication of a shift in Soviet policy toward greater flexibility in dealing with Bonn.

The agreement on compensation, which is expected to be signed next week, would provide about $500 million over the next 20 years to former German property owners who lost their possessions in what is now East Germany.

The new arms deal, which has been under negotiation for several months, is seen as a sign of closer military ties between Moscow and East Berlin. It also reflects East Germany’s growing dependence on Soviet support.

Khrushchev’s decision to allow the compensation agreement to go forward came after intense pressure from West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, who met with Khrushchev in Moscow last week.

The property claims issue has been a major obstacle to improved relations between East and West Germany for years. The East German Government has consistently refused to pay compensation, arguing that it is not responsible for the actions of the Nazi regime.

West Germany has long maintained that the East German Government must provide compensation to former property owners as a condition for any significant improvement in relations.



The new arms deal is expected to give East Germany a considerable boost in its air defense capabilities. The surface-to-air missiles are capable of intercepting high-flying bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.

Soviet officials have said that the arms deal is intended to strengthen East Germany’s defenses against possible attack from the West. However, Western diplomats believe that it also serves as a reminder to NATO allies of Soviet military power.



The compensation agreement is expected to be welcomed by many in West Germany, but it is likely to draw criticism from some conservatives who argue that it rewards the East German Government for its past actions.

East German officials have hailed the agreement as a sign of improved relations between the two countries. However, they have also warned that it does not resolve all outstanding issues.



The new arms deal and the compensation agreement are part of a broader pattern of increased Soviet involvement in East Germany. Moscow has been providing East Berlin with economic and military assistance for years, but its support has become increasingly important in recent months as East Germany’s economy has faltered.

Soviet officials have said that they are committed to supporting East Germany’s socialist system. However, Western diplomats believe that Khrushchev is also interested in maintaining Soviet influence in Eastern Europe.



The property claims issue first arose after World War II when millions of Germans fled or were expelled from what is now East Germany. Many of these people lost their homes and businesses.

West Germany has been pressing for compensation for years, but the East German Government has consistently refused to pay. The new agreement represents a major breakthrough in the long-standing dispute.



The arms deal is expected to be completed within the next few months. Soviet technicians are already training East German personnel on how to operate the new weapons systems.

Western diplomats believe that the arms deal and the compensation agreement are part of a broader effort by Khrushchev to improve relations with West Germany and reduce tensions in Europe.



Soviet officials have said that they want to create a more stable and predictable environment in Europe. However, Western diplomats remain skeptical about Khrushchev’s intentions. They note that he has a history of making grand gestures followed by abrupt policy reversals.

The compensation agreement is expected to be signed in East Berlin next week. Chancellor Kiesinger is expected to attend the signing ceremony.



Soviet officials have said that they are pleased with the progress made in relations between East and West Germany. However, they have also warned that there are still many obstacles to overcome.

The new arms deal is likely to raise concerns among NATO allies about Soviet military intentions. Western diplomats believe that it will prompt a review of NATO’s defense posture in Europe.



Khrushchev’s decision to allow the compensation agreement to go forward is seen as a sign of his willingness to compromise with the West. However, some analysts believe that he may be using the agreement as a bargaining chip in other negotiations.

The arms deal is expected to give East Germany a significant advantage over West Germany in terms of military capabilities. Western diplomats believe that it will prompt West Germany to seek closer ties with NATO allies.



Soviet officials have said that they are committed to maintaining peace and stability in Europe. However, Western diplomats remain wary of Khrushchev’s intentions. They note that he has a history of using propaganda and deception to achieve his goals.

II.S. LINKS CANCER
WITH CIGARETTES

Health Service Data
Industry Group Contends
It Is Still Lacking



By GEORGE WEISSFELD
Special to The New York Times
WASHINGTON, July 12 — The Public Health Service announced today that it has found a “strong statistical association” between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.

The report, based on data collected from nearly 1 million men in the United States and Canada, is the most comprehensive study ever undertaken to determine the link between smoking and disease.

The report’s findings are certain to intensify the debate over whether cigarettes should be regulated by the Federal Government. The tobacco industry has long maintained that there is no conclusive proof of a causal relationship between smoking and cancer.

The Public Health Service study, which took 25 years to complete, examined data collected from men in various occupations, including miners, railroad workers, steelworkers and construction workers.

The report concluded that the risk of lung cancer increases with each year of smoking and with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The risk is particularly high for those who start smoking at an early age.

The Public Health Service study also found a strong association between cigarette smoking and other diseases, including heart disease, emphysema and bronchitis.

The tobacco industry has criticized the Public Health Service report, arguing that it does not prove that cigarettes cause cancer. The industry contends that other factors, such as exposure to industrial pollutants, may be responsible for the increased risk of lung cancer among smokers.

However, health officials say that the Public Health Service study provides overwhelming evidence that cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer. They say that the report should serve as a warning to all Americans about the dangers of smoking.



The Public Health Service report comes at a time when there is growing public concern about the health effects of cigarette smoking. Several states have already enacted laws restricting smoking in public places, and many cities are considering similar measures.

The report also comes amid increasing pressure on Congress to regulate the tobacco industry. Some members of Congress have proposed legislation that would require cigarette manufacturers to warn consumers about the dangers of smoking.



The Public Health Service study is expected to have a significant impact on the debate over whether cigarettes should be regulated by the Federal Government. The report provides strong evidence that cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, and it is likely to sway public opinion in favor of regulation.

The tobacco industry is expected to mount a vigorous defense against any attempt to regulate cigarettes. However, the Public Health Service study has given proponents of regulation a powerful new weapon in their arsenal.



The report’s findings are certain to be scrutinized by scientists and policymakers for years to come. The study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between cigarette smoking

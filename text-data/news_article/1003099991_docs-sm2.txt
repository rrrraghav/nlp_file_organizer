Less Hazardous

Cigarettes Sought

WASHINGTON - The use of highly porous cigarettes,
National Cancer Institute officials say, could sharply reduce the amount of
harmful chemicals inhaled by smokers and thereby producing less tar and
potentially reducing the risk of cancer. “We’ve been working on this for
years,” said Dr. Richard Doll, senior scientist at the institute. "The burning
of tobacco produces a great deal of particulate matter, and so does down-
drafting it into the lungs.” The porous cigarettes, Dr. Doll said, also filter
out some of the harmful chemicals.
Dr. Elsie Golde, deputy director of the National Cancer Institute, said that
the institute is not recommending smokers switch to porous cigarettes “be-
cause we don’t know enough about their long-term effects.” She added that
the institute's work is aimed at finding ways to reduce cancer risk and
“we are looking at a whole range of products but some others."
The institute has been studying the effect of cigarette porosity on the
amount of harmful chemicals inhaled. “We have toyed with the idea
of health hazards – a number of approaches,” Dr. Doll said. "We’re
trying to find ways to reduce the risk, and we feel that this is one way.”
The porous cigarettes are designed to burn more evenly, and Dr. Doll said
that they produce less carbon monoxide. “Carbon monoxide is a gas
Tobacco companies are supposed to have been used in chewing gum and
in some candies,” he noted. "It’s also produced when you smoke."
Dr. Golde said that the institute has not conducted tests on porous cigarettes
to determine whether they reduce cancer risk, but she added that “it is a
promising avenue of research.” The institute is now conducting studies to
determine the effects of cigarette porosity on the body.

Dr. Doll said that the institute has been working on this for years, but he
added that “we’re still in the early stages.” He noted that the institute is
also exploring other ways to reduce cancer risk, such as developing
filters and reducing the amount of tar in cigarettes.

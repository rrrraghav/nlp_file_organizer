FL Tobacco-Racketeeing, Florida to Add Racketeeing Count To Tobacco lawsuit

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) Florida plans to add a racketeering count to its lawsuit against the tobacco industry, possibly tripling the $2 billion in damages the state is seeking.

The state believes there is “significant criminal activity” to justify adding the racketeering claim to the civil suit Florida filed against cigarette makers, Attorney General Bob Butterworth said.

A racketeering count would be based on claims that the industry lied to federal officials, committed fraud, illegally marketed its products to children and conspired to deceive the public about the dangers of cigarettes.

Butterworth said Florida has more information to support such a claim now than it did when it filed in 1995.

Stephen Krischer, an attorney for Philip Morris, said it’s no surprise that Florida is talking about racketeering.

“They’re copying efforts made by some of the other attorney generals in other states,” he said. “Such a claim has about as much merit as the claims that have already been dismissed.”

With the charge, Butterworth said the state could present evidence that tobacco companies conspired to mislead and confuse

Media Uproar Over Chinese Safe Cigaret

WEEKLY GENDAI

Researched and Developed by the Chinese Over Six-Year Period

A new type of cigarot—called Safe Cigarets by the Chinese--
has made its debut in Japan under the brand names Chuzaku
and Chunrenkai. Both brands are of the same standard size as
Seven Star and other major domestic brands. Trial
manufacture of the two brands began just this past March,
and neither have come to market yet even in China.

Says an anonymous trade official with close contacts to the
Chinese government, "It took six years to develop these two
brands. Trial cigarets were sent to Premier Hu, who after a
single puff said ‘Unih. These are good. These will go.
Well done! That’s how good the flavor is.”

It is reported that Hu himself came up with the name
Chunrenkai for one of the brands. The safe cigaret is truly
a ground breaking product enjoying the support of the entire
nation. And it also clearly shows how the Chinese
government exerts its influence.

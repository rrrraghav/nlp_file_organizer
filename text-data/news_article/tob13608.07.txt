The Tobacco Institute’s Smoke Screen

I sure am impressed with the Tobacco Institute's plan to require cigarette ads on billboards be at least 500 feet from schools and playing grounds. That’s farther away than the length of one, but not two, football fields.

Haven’t the concerned people seen how huge these billboards are? At that distance, the kids can still see them. The problem is the ads are the ones who haven't learned to read. It doesn’t matter, even the ones who can’t read will still be attracted by the cartoon characters and young people enjoying sports shown on the cigarette billboard ads. One part of the billboards

will be too small to read from 500 feet away, though—the required health warnings. What a plan.

I would be a little more inclined to take the Tobacco Institute seriously when it says it wants to keep young people from starting to smoke if it stopped all billboard advertising, stopped sponsoring rock concerts and sports events, placed ads only on the inside pages of newspapers and magazines and weren’t starting an “If It Is Bad, It Must Be Good” campaign that will probably make smoking even more attractive fruit to naturally rebellious teenagers.

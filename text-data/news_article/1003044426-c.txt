( Smokers Tax
Would Pay
Space Costs

NEW YORK, April 5 - (AP) - Taxes paid last year by United States smokers would more than cover the 1962 budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a tobacco industry organization estimated today.

Cigarette taxes in 1961 amounted to about $11 billion dollars at local, state and federal levels, according to the Tobacco Institute.

The institute is an organization representing most of the cigarette and tobacco manufacturers.

The total set of tax revenues collected last year was $10.983 billion. The cost of space would amount to approximately $5 billion.  The collection of cigarette taxes has been a financial boon for Federal, State and local governments.

The institute said that part of the money could be used to finance the nation’s space program. “It is possible,” it stated, “that collections could go toward space exploration as an alternative use.”

Smoking: A Bum Rap?

Smoking, which may be harmful
to your health, has always been
a favorite pastime. But now,
eighty-six of the nation’s largest
corporations are joining forces
in a campaign to prove that
smoking is not as dangerous as
it's made out to be.

The corporations, in conjunction
with the Tobacco Institute, are
spending $20 million to underwrite
scientific research and public
relations efforts designed to
convince the American people that
smoking isn’t so bad after all.

The campaign is being directed
by a Washington-based public
relations firm, Hill & Knowlton,
which also handled the publicity
for the South Vietnamese govern-
ment during the war. The firm
is known for its ability to create
a favorable image for clients who
are in trouble.

“We’re not trying to say that
smoking is good for you,” says
Robert J. White, president of
the Tobacco Institute. “But we
believe that the evidence against
smoking has been exaggerated.”

The corporations involved in
the campaign include: American
Tobacco Company, British-American
Tobacco Company, Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corporation,
Philip Morris Incorporated, and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

The campaign is expected to
be controversial. Anti-smoking
groups have already condemned it
as an attempt by the tobacco
industry to mislead the public.

“This is a cynical ploy,” says
Dr. Richard Schatzker, president
of the American Heart Association.
“These corporations are trying
to buy their way out of the
problem.”

The campaign is expected to
last for several years. It will
include television commercials,
magazine advertisements, and
public service announcements.

The corporations involved in
the campaign have a lot at stake.
Smoking-related illnesses cost
the nation billions of dollars
each year. If smoking were proven
to be as dangerous as anti-smoking
groups claim, the tobacco industry
could face lawsuits for billions
of dollars.

The corporations are also
concerned about the impact that
anti-smoking campaigns have had
on sales. Smoking rates have been
declining steadily in recent years.
If smoking continues to decline,
the tobacco industry could lose
billions of dollars in revenue.

The campaign is being directed
by a team of public relations
experts led by Thomas Johnson,
a senior vice president at Hill &
Knowlton. Johnson has been
involved in numerous high-profile
public relations campaigns, including
the one for the Dow Chemical
Company after the disaster at
Bhopal.

Johnson says that the campaign
is not intended to encourage
people to start smoking. “We’re
just trying to provide people with
a more balanced perspective on
the issue,” he says.

The campaign is expected to
be closely watched by anti-smoking
groups and government regulators.
It could have a significant impact
on the debate over smoking.

memorize any lines."

who prefers to let his
work speak for itself.
He is not interested in
fame or fortune. He just
wants to do a good job.

“I’m proud of what I
do,” Ernest says. “It’s
a unique skill, and I
think it’s important.”

Angeles with his wife
and two children. He is

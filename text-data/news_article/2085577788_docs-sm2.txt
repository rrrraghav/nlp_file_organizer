Smoking bill

Restaurant ban should pass

The Honolulu City Council is about to do the right thing by banning smoking from public places. Council members should not be deterred by arguments that the ban will hurt business or infringe on the rights of smokers.

The most common argument: that restaurant owners and employees will suffer, worried about a decline in business and lost income. This effect. Times are rough enough without imposing restrictions that prevent people from patronize restaurants.

The fact is, however, that there is growing evidence that smoking bans have little or no impact. Studies of casinos and other data have suggested that any initial dip in sales quickly rebounds when the ban is in place.

The most immediate result is a more pleasant atmosphere. In the case then a regulation, as with all regulations, customers should have a positive impact.

In California, for example, after smoking bans were implemented, the economic effects were less severe than opponents predicted. The potential for increased ventilation and other measures to protect non-smokers would also be realized.

A ban on smoking in restaurants is not an attack on smokers’ freedom. It is a recognition that the rights of all citizens must be balanced. Non-smokers have a right to breathe clean air, especially when they are paying customers.

The council should approve the bill.

smokers. But that’s true also for non-smokers in workplaces, public buildings, and other places. The inconvenience must be balanced against the health benefits of preventing exposure to secondhand smoke.

Most responsible smokers already recognize this. They have voluntarily curtailed their smoking habits. We don't need to expand that thinking.

A ban on smoking in restaurants is a reasonable step toward creating a healthier Hawaii. It would send a message that we value public health and the well-being of all our citizens.

Washington, D.C.—The following statement was issued today by Philip Morris Incorporated; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation; and the Lorillard Tobacco Company:

The settlement announced today in the Broin flight attendants lawsuit represents a common sense approach to resolving the class action aspects of the case in a way that is consistent with the much broader legislative resolution now pending before Congress.

The settlement funds will be directed to medical research relating to cigarette smoking. The settlement permits flight attendants to pursue their personal injury claims individually, if they choose to do so.

Individual class members filing personal injury claims must prove that they were directly harmed by environmental tobacco smoke. On that basis, the companies remain confident of their respective positions on this issue and intend to present compelling evidence to juries in any individual cases that may be filed.

The companies continue to believe that class actions are inappropriate vehicles for addressing claims of individual injury related to tobacco—a position that has been upheld by virtually every court beginning with the Fifth Circuit’s landmark decision in the Casing class action lawsuit.

The Broin settlement is a practical solution to the tobacco class action and reflects the common sense approach embodied in the June 20 agreement. The industry continues to support Congressional enactment of comprehensive legislation that has as its basis the goal of reducing youth smoking.

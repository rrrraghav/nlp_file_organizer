STATEMENT FROM PHILLIP MORRIS BOARD OF DIRECTORS
REGARDING TOBACCO SETTLEMENT


NEW YORK, June 25, 1997 -- The Board of Directors of Phillip Morris
Companies Inc. (NYSE: MO) today unanimously voted to support the
comprehensive tobacco proposals that were agreed to by Philip Morris
management last week.

While the agreement contains certain legislative and regulatory
provisions with which the company does not agree, the Board believes
achieving a resolution of the long-standing controversy surrounding tobacco
products is in the interest of the public and our shareholders.

We accept this compromise, which must now go before the Congress,
as the best available way to end decades of acrimony with a national solution
that achieves important public health goals, permits our company to operate
in a predictable legal and regulatory environment, recognizes the rights of
adult smokers to use tobacco products, and ensures that the tobacco industry
will remain an important contributor to the U.S. economy.

We hope that these proposals will usher in a new era of cooperation
and tolerance with regard to tobacco issues, and we are grateful for the hard
work of all the participants in the negotiations that has brought this proposal
before the nation.

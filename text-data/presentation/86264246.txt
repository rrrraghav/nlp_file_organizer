NEWS RELEASE BULLETIN: OHIO

June 25, 1999

The Ohio state legislature has passed a law that requires those cigarette manufacturers who are not signatories of the Master Settlement Agreement to place $1.88 into an escrow account for each carton of their cigarettes sold in the state. The law went into effect on June at, 1999. All of the 46 states involved in the Master Settlement Agreement of November 1998 are required to pass a similar law which seeks to ensure that non-signatories do not gain an unfair advantage in the marketplace.

As of July 30, 1999, a total of 37 of the 46 states involved in the Master Settlement Agreement have passed similar legislation. Ohio is considered an important state for cigarette manufacturers because it ranks in fourth place in terms of cigarette sales among all fifty states.

The Ohio Attorney General’s office as well as state tax authorities are investigating the sales volumes of all non-signatories in the state.

It is the opinion of Carolina Tobacco Company, trademark owner and exclusive importer of the “ROGER” cigarette brand, that authorities in the state of Ohio and in other states will turn their attention to the wholesalers/jobbers who stamp those cigarettes manufactured by non-signatories - when they are unable to obtain escrow funds from the manufacturers themselves. It is important to remember that the states are obligated to seek these funds from non-signatories, as this was negotiated in the Master Settlement Agreement.

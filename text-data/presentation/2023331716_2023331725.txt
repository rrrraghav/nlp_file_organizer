EPA’s Use of Science

The science on Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is complicated. The methodology used by EPA for analyzing that science is controversial. The conclusions the EPA reached are not supported by that science.

Here are some basic points that must be understood:

The EPA reviewed 30 studies on lung cancer and ETS exposure, which were published by independent researchers around the world beginning in the early 1980s.

The EPA conducted no original research.

Each of these studies is an epidemiological study. Put in the simplest possible terms, the results are mathematical or statistical calculations of disease risk based on responses to survey questionnaires, primarily by the non smoking spouses of smoking husbands. This is not clinical or laboratory research. In fact, the very few animal inhalation studies that have been done don’t support the EPA’s conclusion.

Such epidemiological work is, by its very nature, prone to a wide variety of errors, particularly if the study results are inconclusive or do not adequately address factors related to

OSHA testimony RCA, 4th draft, September 30, 1994

OSHA definition of
"material impairment of health":

"... when the worker is clinically
diagnosed with a condition that is either
caused or aggravated by poor indoor air
quality in the workplace"

29 CFR Parts 1910, 1915, 1928, p. 1567(1994)   T.S. Carothers-36,5ug#4

Court definition of "significant risk":

In the Benzene case, the Supreme Court stated
that Section 3(b) of the OSHA Act requires the Agency
before the promulgation of any standard must find
"on the basis of substantial evidence, that it is at least
more likely than not that long-term exposure
presents a significant risk of material health
impairment”

which the Court defined as:

"...the odds are only in a discussion that regular
inhalation... will be fatal..."

448 U.S. 855 (1980)   T.S. Carothers-36,5ug#4

November was another excellent month, with sales up 15.4%, gross
profit up 40.9% and operating income up 26.2%.

Advertising and selling costs increased sharply, due to new
LUCKY STRIKE Filters

For the year-to-date, operating income is now up $48,268,000 or 17.7%.

On December 16, we announced another price increase, effective the
end of the year. This increase was 70¢ per thousand.

The industry will start 1983 with selling prices (on 100’s and
PALL MALL Red) 35% higher than the start of 1982. The 35% is the equivalent
of 4720 per thousand or 4.72 per centos or 15.74 per pound
approximately with one-half
of the 35% increase, 19% is the $60.00 per thousand excise tax increase.

It is impossible to say just what the effect of these increases will be
on consumer sales. The impact has hopefully been minimized by the fact
that the increases have come in several steps.

Even short-term sales are difficult to project, due to abnormal trade
purchases at year-end.

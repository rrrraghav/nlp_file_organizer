"Lozillard, particularly through their Kent Golden Lights brand,
put in an extremely strong performance in the 4th quarter, being
up some 6%. This compares with Philip Morris, with the second
largest increase - up 5.1% in the 4th quarter. In our opinion,
Lozillard, particularly with the recent drop in tar content
of True (which appears to have recently improved its volume
gains), could well grow in the area of 7% in 1977."

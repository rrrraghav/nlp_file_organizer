HELD STATEWIDE …… YOURS, BRING THE FIRST, IS THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE OF
WASHINGTON – INC., A NON-PROFIT, NON-COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION WHOSE MEMBERS
ARE ELEVEN MANUFACTURERS OF
MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF
CIGARETTS AND OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS
IN THE UNITED STATES.

MANAGER
YOU’LL SOON HEAR FROM THE REGIONAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE
WHO WILL BE INTRODUCED A LITTLE LATER IN THE PROGRAM, ALSO JOINING US
THIS EVENING IS THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE TOBACCO ASSOCIATION WHO WILL
IN TURN INTRODUCE THE LEGISLATORS WHO ARE PRESENT TONIGHT.

SINCE WE MET WITH SOME OF YOU, UNDER A SIMILAR SITUATION, TWO YEARS AGO,
MANY THINGS HAVE TRANPIRED EFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY.

1) THE COUNCIL ON SMOKING AND HEALTH… AN ORGANIZATION SPONSORED BY
THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY…AID A SERIES OF MEETINGS IN
SIX MAJOR CITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, SEATTLE BEING ONE,
WHERE PRESUMPTIVELY, THEIR AIM WAS TO GET PUBLIC INPUT ON THE
SMOKING AND HEALTH ISSUE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE RESTRICTIVE
OF THE USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY.
THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT IT WAS A STACKED COMMITTEE, HEADED BY
A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PUBLIC PILATIONS FIRM AND WAS TRULY A
"Dog-and-Pony” Show!

IN SEATTLE, AT THE ALL-DAY HEARING, IT’S THOUGHT THAT 24 PEOPLE ATTENDED.

FEDERAL JUDGE FINDS NO BASIS
FOR SUIT AGAINST PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (July 10, 2001) – A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit set for
trial next month against Philip Morris U.S.A. filed by Donald LaBelle on behalf of his
wife, Christine, a smoker with lung cancer who died in 1997 at the age of 41.

In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Patrick Michael Duffy noted that the
law simply did not permit the case to go to trial even though he was required to view the
allegations in the light most favorable for the plaintiff.

“We are pleased Judge Duffy agreed with us that this lawsuit was without merit,”
said William S. Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris vice president and associate general counsel.

In rejecting the claim that cigarettes are defective in design, Judge Duffy wrote
that “a product is not defective merely because it is inherently dangerous” and that the
plaintiff must "demonstrate that cigarettes could have feasibly been made safer. If one
cannot demonstrate that a product is capable of safer design, then logically it should be
viewed as inherently dangerous.”

LaBelle argued that “a feasible alternative design” did exist that would have
enabled Philip Morris U.S.A. to reduce the risks of cigarettes, based on the testimony of
William Farone, a former company scientist who has testified in several smoking and
health cases against Philip Morris U.S.A.

However, after reviewing Farone’s testimony in those cases, Judge Duffy rejected
Farone's assertions as unproven speculation. And even if such products could have been
produced, there was no evidence to show that Mrs. LaBelle would have chosen to smoke
them.

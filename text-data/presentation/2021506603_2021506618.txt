KEIN:

JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN CONNECTION WITH A

PARTICULAR BRAND FLOWS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF THE BRAND

MANAGER. THEREFORE, HE OR SHE IS IN THE PERFECT POSITION

TO OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT, EXECUTION AND REFINEMENT OF

A BRAND’S IMAGE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. IN BROAD TERMS,

HE MUST COORDINATE ALL THE ACTIVITIES SURROUNDING THE

MARKETING OF HIS BRAND. AS A RESULT, IT'S NECESSARY

THAT HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT HIS BRAND THAN ANYONE ELSE IN

THE COMPANY.

SIX MAJOR AMERICAN CIGARETTE COMPANIES RELEASE
COMBINED INGREDIENTS LIST

New York -- Philip Morris U.S.A., along with the five other major American cigarette manufacturers, today approved the release of the industry’s combined list of ingredients added to tobacco in cigarettes manufactured and sold in the United States.

"The industry's decision to make this proprietary information publicly available to our consumers is in response to misleading allegations recently made about the nature of the ingredients used in our products," said Steven Parrish, senior vice president and general counsel for Philip Morris manufacturers. 

Parrish said that Philip Morris and the other five companies had been submitting a list of ingredients added to tobacco used in cigarettes manufactured and sold in the United States to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as required by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act each year since 1986. The act recognizes that cigarette ingredients are trade secrets and requires that HHS maintain strict confidentiality.

"Unfortunately," Parrish said, "the confidentiality that Congress mandated for cigarette ingredients information has been mischaracterized as an attempt by cigarette manufacturers to be ‘secretive’ and keep information from the American public."

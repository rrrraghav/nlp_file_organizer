EFFECTIVENESS, BUDGET, TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION, SMOKING RESTRICTIONS

MONTREAL, 4 October 1995 — The 31st Session of the ICAO Assembly concluded today with
the adoption of 24 resolutions by the 915 participants from 151 Contracting States and 27 Observer delegations.
The resolutions covered subjects such as the 1996-1997-1998 budget and work programmes of the Organization,
measures to increase its effectiveness, technical co-operation, implementation of the satellite-based
communication, navigation, surveillance and air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system, controlled flight into
terrain (CFIT) and smoking restrictions on international flights.

Budget

The Assembly approved the triennial budget of the Organization as follows:

1996 US $530 340 000
1997 US $591 101 000
1998 US $654 596 000

There is also a conditional appropriation of $6.02 million over the triennium.

Increasing the effectiveness of ICAO

The Assembly acknowledged that ICAO has for over 50 years effectively and efficiently fulfilled
its functions, but recognized that the Organization needs to be even more efficient when faced with new and
rapidly evolving technological, economic, social and legal challenges at a time of global financial constraints.
While expressing appreciation to the Council and the Secretary General for the progress made in developing the
Organization’s Strategic Action Plan, the Assembly directed them to intensify efforts to systematically develop
the plan to improve effectiveness, transparency and accountability. This resolution also directs the Council to
streamline the working methods and procedures of the ICAO itself; to undertake an intensive review of its
decision-making processes, working methods and procedures of the Council and its subsidiary bodies; and to
ensure the effectiveness of the oversight mechanisms which evaluates the Organization’s work. This resolution
invites the Secretary General to continue to take initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
Organization through procedural, managerial and administrative reforms.

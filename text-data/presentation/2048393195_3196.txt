STATEMENT BY PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.

NEW YORK, March 21, 1996 – Last night’s broadcast which featured Victor DeNoble was little more than a rehash of the testimony he gave before a Congressional subcommittee in 1984.

It is no secret that Philip Morris has said in the past and before the same Congressional subcommittee that nicotine has mild pharmacological effects.

Nor is it a secret that Philip Morris conducted research on its product just as other manufacturers conduct research on their products. Indeed, if we didn’t conduct such research, we would be properly criticized for not doing so.
(Italics)

It is important to note, as we pointed out to ABC yesterday, that Dr. DeNoble's implications that his research at Philip Morris proved nicotine is “addictive” is contradicted by his own sworn testimony given at a deposition on behalf of an adverse party in litigation against Philip Morris in 1988, four full years after he left Philip Morris’ employment. In that sworn statement, Dr. DeNoble confirmed that his research at Philip Morris led him to conclude the following:

“Nicotine is a reinforcer in the class of non-addictive chemical compounds such as saccharin, or water.” (Emphasis added.)

When asked further for his views in this regard, Dr. DeNoble replied in 1988:

“I don’t believe that it is a correct statement to say that nicotine is addicting. I don't believe that, no."

Moreover, Dr. DeNoble testified that he never did any experimentation with nicotine while at Philip Morris which led him to change his opinion that nicotine was non-addictive, and that he still held that belief at the time of his 1988 deposition.

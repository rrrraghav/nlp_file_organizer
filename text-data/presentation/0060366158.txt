EPIDEMIOLOGIC ASSOCIATIONS HAVE IMPLICATED TOBACCO
SMOKING AS A RISK FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS RESPIRATORY
AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. SOME OF THESE STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED
A DOSE-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CERTAIN DISEASES AND THE
DURATION AND NUMBER OF CIGARETTES CONSUMED, AS WELL AS WITH
INDICATORS OF THE AMOUNT AND DEPTH OF SMOKE INHALATION. FOR SOME
PEOPLE, THE PHARMACOLOGIC BASIS OF SMOKING SEEMS TO BE DEPENDENT
ON THE NICOTINE DELIVERY TO THE SMOKER. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
OR NOT NICOTINE METABOLITES ARE ADDICTING, HOWEVER, IS STILL
DEBATABLE. MOREOVER, SEVERAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT
THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE IN HEALTH HAZARDS TO HEAVY SMOKERS WHO
SWITCH FROM CIGARETTES CONTAINING HIGH TAR AND NICOTINE LEVELS
TO CIGARETTES OF LOW TAR AND NICOTINE CONTENT. THIS POTENTIAL
INCREASED HEALTH HAZARD COULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY CHANGES IN
SMOKING HABITS AND ALTERATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL’S SMOKING PROFILE.
TO QUANTIFY INDIVIDUAL SMOKING BEHAVIOR WHILE VARYING THE NICOTINE
CONTENT OF TOBACCO, WE APPLIED UNDER EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS A
PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED MAGNETOMETER METHOD OF KOHO AND MEAD.
MAY WE HAVE THE FIRST SLIDE? PLEASE?

PHILIP MORRIS STATEMENT
REGARDING UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
CIPOLLONE DECISION

Yesterday, the United States Supreme Court rendered the long awaited
decision on the Cipollone case.

In spite of the anti-tobacco interests’ efforts to make the decision seem like a
defeat for our industry, the fact is that the Court's verdict was a victory for us.

There were three basic issues in this case.

The first and most important -- referred to as the issue of “failure to warn” --
revolved around the question of whether cigarette advertising and label warnings,
in effect since the 1960s, provided consumers with an adequate warning of the risk
factors associated with smoking and health.

On this most important issue, the Court ruled in our favor, and exempted
tobacco companies from post-1969 legal claims that consumers were not adequately
warned.

A second important issue was whether plaintiffs can assert claims that
normal, mainstream cigarette advertising and promotion somehow undermined
the effectiveness of the health warnings. On this issue, the Court also ruled that
post-1969 claims are preempted.

The third issue -- referred to as intentional misrepresentation -- related to the
question of whether tobacco companies engaged in knowing deception by concealing
from consumers information not generally known about the risks of smoking.

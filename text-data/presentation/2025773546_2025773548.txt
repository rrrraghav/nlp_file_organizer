FTC SETTLES CHARGES AGAINST PINKERTON TOBACCO CO.
IN FIRST CASE INVOLVING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE STATUTORY BAN
ON TV ADVERTISING OF SMOKELESS TOBACCO

In its first enforcement action involving alleged violations
of the statutory ban on television advertising of smokeless
tobacco products, the Federal Trade Commission today announced it
has agreed to settle charges against Pinkerton Tobacco Company,
Inc. in connection with Pinkerton’s sponsorship of televised
truck and tractor pulling events known as the “Red Man Series.”

The company's Red Man chewing tobacco and snuff are promi-
nently advertised at these events, the FTC alleged, noting that
the events are videotaped and then shown on cable systems nation-
wide. The FTC charged that Pinkerton violated the Smokeless
Tobacco Act of 1986 -- which includes the television advertising
ban -- by, among other things, paying for extensive advertising
of its tobacco products at the live events and through films
for broadcast on television. This is the first time the use of a
tobacco product’s name in connection with the sponsorship of a
broadcast event has been challenged by the federal government.

Under a proposed agreement to settle these charges, issued
today with the complaint, Pinkerton would be prohibited -- in
connection with its sponsorship of any broadcast event -- from
the use of the color or brand name, logo, selling message,
event name, or the color and design feature of a tobacco product
or its packaging to appear on:

(1) signs in areas such as start and finish lines on which
cameras covering the event routinely focus;

(2) signs on vehicles and other equipment on which cameras
routinely focus; or

more .

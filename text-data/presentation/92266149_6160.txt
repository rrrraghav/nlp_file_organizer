BILL SWANSON

GOOD MORNING
THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ON BEHALF
OF MYSELF AND MY COMPANY LORILLARD, IT IS A PLEASURE TO
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOUR CONVENTION. THE
VIRGINIA WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATION HAS
ALWAYS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO
LEADERSHIP IN OUR FINE INDUSTRY./ DICK ORCUTT, SENIOR
V.P., SALES LORILLARD, DELIVERED THIS "STATE OF THE
INDUSTRY" TALK AT THE S.F.C.A. ON JUNE 6TH. FOR THOSE
OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE THAT HEARD IT ON THAT DAY, I
APOLOGIZE - NOT BIG SHOW-BOATING TO THOSE OF YOU
THAT HAVE NOT HEARD IT, I HOPE YOU FIND IT
ENLIGHTENING.

MY REMARKS THIS MORNING WILL DEAL PRIMARILY WITH THE
STATE OF THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY. I REALIZE THERE ARE
MANY SUPPLIERS IN THE ROOM WHO ARE NOT IN THE CIGARETTE
BUSINESS -- BUT WHETHER YOU'RE IN CANDY, HEALTH AND
BEAUTY AIDS, LIGHTERS, RAZOR BLADES, SNACK FOODS, OR
THE VIRGINIA
ANY OTHER IMPORTANT SUPPLY AREA TO THESE MEMBERS, I
BELIEVE YOUR POSITION MAY BE ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF THE
CIGARETTE MAKERS. IF YOU DON'T SHARE PROBLEMS
TO OURS TODAY, YOU MAY TOMORROW!

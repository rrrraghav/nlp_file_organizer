GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE PHILIP MORRIS K.K. 1991
ORIGINAL BUDGET PRESENTATIONS.

IT’S NOT OFTEN THAT WE GET A STAR-STUDDED CAST LIKE THIS TO
JAPAN SO WE'RE PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO PRESENT TO YOU, ON OUR OWN TERRITORY, OUR RECENT PROGRESS
AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.

AS FOR THE AGENDA…

WE’LL BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE TOTAL
MARKET, FOLLOWED BY THE KEY SEGMENTATION TRENDS AND COMPANY
PERFORMANCES.

THEN WE'LL REVIEW THE 1991 ORIGINAL BUDGET FORECAST AND OUR
MARKET AND SALES PROGRAMS.

BEFORE WE BEGIN THE MARKET OVERVIEW, HOWEVER, I’D LIKE TO
MAKE A FEW OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OUR PROGRESS SINCE THE MARKET
OPENING, OUR VIEW OF THE MARKET DYNAMICS OVER THE PLAN
PERIOD, OUR CORPORATE OBJECTIVES AND SOME OF THE MAJOR
CHALLENGES WE FACE.

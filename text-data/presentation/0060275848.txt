STATEMENT OF BRUCE FLYE, CHAIRMAN,
THE NATIONAL TOBACCO COUNCIL

SPONSORSHIP OF SPORTS AND CULTURAL EVENTS
BY CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS

Submitted to
The Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health
October 27, 1988

Our Federal government has failed to manage its budget
deficit, a trade imbalance and banking crisis. Our
government in Washington seems unable to manage forest
fires, ensure the safety of its own nuclear energy
plants, prevent hospital waste from washing up on
recreational beaches or keep illicit drugs from our
children.

Although it has spent billions of dollars in the
process, our government has failed to control
health care costs, ensure an adequate and safe supply of
water or deal with inner city crime.

But, on October 27, representatives of most of the major
departments and agencies of our government will

contemplate questions that have never occurred to the
vast majority of the people it serves.

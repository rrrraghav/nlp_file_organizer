Three Years After the Surgeon General’s Report*

Daniel Horn, Ph.D.**

As I look at the topic assigned to me today, “We have stopped
smoking, why haven't our patients,” I wonder, since I have no patients,
if this makes me an impatient man. Perhaps it does. There are times
when I become very impatient at the slow pace of our campaign against
the hazards of cigarette smoking.

On the eve of the third anniversary of the Report to the Surgeon
General on Smoking and Health we read in the market reports that
cigarette consumption is on the rise. Halfly half of the adult population
are now cigarette smokers and some 1,500,000 teenagers join the ranks
every year. An estimated 300,000 of these adult smokers will die
prematurely this year; millions more will suffer one or more chronic
conditions; untold numbers will be sick enough to stay home from work -
all because of cigarette smoking.

This is far from a pleasant picture for an anniversary celebration.
However, it could be much worse. We have made progress in a significant
way.

Let’s go back in history for a moment and look at what has actually
been happening to smoking in this country. After the close of World
War II, when servicemen returned home and cigarettes were no longer in
short supply, yearly consumption started to climb. Presumably this
upward trend would have continued except for four important events. The
first was the initial reports, three in this country and one in England,
linking the use of tobacco to the increasing incidence of lung cancer.

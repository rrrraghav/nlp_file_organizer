MARLBORO RACING TEAM PENSKE TRAVELS TO AUSTRALIA

March 8, 1991, Reading, PA -- For the first time ever
Marlboro Racing Team Penske will set down on Australian soil
Saturday March 9 in preparation for the March 17 Gold Coast Indy
Car Grand Prix.

Although transporting the cars is nothing new to Marlboro
Racing Team Penske (chassis’ are shipped annually from Penske
Cars in Poole, England), the difficulty arises in moving an
entire team and limiting the amount of equipment to comply with
weight restrictions imposed by CART. Each team is allowed one
pallet (a portable platform designed for shipping cargo) for
each car being sent and one pallet of equipment (up to 5,000
pounds) for each car competing in the race (back-up cars are not
allowed a separate pallet of equipment).

According to Team Penske Coordinator Tim Lombardi, "due to
weight restrictions we have to limit the amount of equipment we
send. This means that we have to sit back and decide what is
absolutely necessary to send to Australia to be competitive.
When we race in North America, we travel by truck and we send as
much equipment as we choose. Now we have to be much more
selective."

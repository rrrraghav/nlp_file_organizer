Cell Proliferation in the Nasal Epithelium of the Rat
after acute Exposure to Fresh Sidestream Smoke of
the Standard Reference Cigarette 1R4F

Objective
• determination of cell proliferation in the rat nasal epithelium
after acute exposure (1 day) to Fresh Sidestream Smoke (FSS)

Cigarette Rats
• 1R4F cigarette (University of Kentucky) • male outbred SPF Sprague-Dawley rats
• conditioning • Charles River Viga (Germany)
⇨ 22 ± 1 °C • health certificate from breeder
⇨ 60 ± 2% relative humidity • no health check by CRC/NIBIO

FSS Generation FSS characterization
• 30-port positive pressure smoking • TPM
machine with 6 cigarettes • carbon monoxide
• in basic conformity with ISO standards, • nicotine
except • aldehydes
• free (open-end) smoking • formaldehyde
⇨ rectangular puff profile • acrolein
• acetaldehyde

Animal housing Exposure
• fresh, filtered, conditioned air • head-only, in 48-position chamber
• positive pressure • 2 groups of 8 rats, randomly allocated
• no restricted access area • sham control group
• no extensive hygiene barrier • FSS test atmosphere group
• concentration: 10µg TPM/l
• duration: 1 day, 6h

Determination of cell proliferation Statistical analysis
• application of BrdU before killing of rats • mean and standard error for the relative
• removal of nasal epithelium, enzymatic number of cells with incorporated BrdU
and mechanical disintegration • Mann-Whitney U-test for comparison of
• fixation of cells groups
• denaturation of DNA to single strand • statistical significance at p ≤0.05
• labeling of BrdU with mouse-antibody

detection of labeled BrdU (fluorescence
after binding to fluorescein-conjugated
antibody)
• flowcytometric evaluation of 10⁶ cells per
measurement

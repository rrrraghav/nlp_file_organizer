the opportunity to win recognition by using their writing skills to share an important message
with their peers – it’s not cool to smoke.

The TeenH.I.P. (Teens Helping Influence People) Cool News Program, sponsored by
the Lorillard Tobacco Company's Youth Smoking Prevention Program, offers middle- and high
school students a chance to win $5,000 in computer equipment and services for their school,
plus notice for their writing skills, for publishing an article in their school paper that explains
why kids shouldn’t light up.

“Lorillard is 100 percent committed to significantly reducing teen smoking, and
through our Youth Smoking Prevention Program, we hope to drive home the message that
smoking is not a ‘cool’ thing to do,” says Steve Watson, vice president, external affairs,

message to their peers using their own stories and in their own language.”

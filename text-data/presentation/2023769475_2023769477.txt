FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


New York, April 2, 1993 -- Philip Morris USA, the U.S. tobacco division of
Philip Morris Companies Inc., announced a major shift in business strategy
designed to increase market share and grow long term profitability in a
highly price sensitive market environment.

William I. Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Philip
Morris USA said, "We have determined that in the current market
environment caused by prolonged economic softness and depressed
consumer confidence, we should take these steps necessary to grow our
market share rather than pursue rapid income growth rates which might
erode our leading marketplace position."

Philip Morris USA will launch an important pricing and marketing
program to deal with the current conditions in the marketplace, which
have been marked by the rapid growth of discount cigarettes.

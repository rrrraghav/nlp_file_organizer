'PRESENTATION TO RRM, HC AND HM ON JUNE 8, 1978

BY CORPORATE AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, PME, LAUSANNE

CONCERNING SMOKING AND HEALTH CONTROVERSY

Our presentation is divided in three parts. Paul Iserning will inform you about ICOSI’s latest plans, and latest details on the activities of the working groups and task forces, with the exception of those of the medical group, which will be given by Helmut Gaisch.

I will kick off with a brief analysis of the situation in some of our key markets, partly based on reports given to us by our consultants during our first Regional Corporate Affairs Conference, and tantly based on our own analysis of the recent press reports. etc.

We will also give you a very brief summary of the attitudes of the various tobacco associations at the moment.

After Paul and Helmut, I will as briefly as I can, tell you what PME is doing and planning to do in the future and how this interfaces with ICOSI.

A sitrep of the Smoking and Health in our Region.

1. One feature was predominant in all reports of our ten public affairs consultants in the Regions, that was :

 - there is no controversy in the public mind or in governments' attitudes.
Smoking causes diseases. Basta.

2. In all countries, pressures on Governments to increase the number of regulations aimed at curbing tobacco are growing.

3. In all countries, the public Smoking Issue, including social "unacceptability" is growing in leaps and bounds.

BILLBOARD INDUSTRY ANNOUNCES NEW CODE OF ADVERTISING PRACTICES

New York City: The Outdoor Advertising Association of America
(OAAA) announced today that it has adopted a new Code of Advertising
Practices. The code recommends that each billboard company formally
adopt advertising standards to effectively address community concerns
about the advertising of products that may not be sold to minors.

The policy encourages individual OAAA companies to "establish
exclusionary zones which prohibit advertisements of all products
illegal for sale to minors which are either intended to be read from,
or within 500 feet of, established places of worship, primary and
secondary schools, and hospitals."

The code also recommends the establishment of voluntary limits on
the number of billboards in a market that may carry messages about
products that cannot be sold to minors. The code reiterates a
billboard company's right to reject creative content which may be
deemed in poor taste. It encourages greater diversity of advertised
products and reemphasizes the industry’s tradition of donating free
space to worthy community and civic causes. Last year the billboard
industry donated $141 million to charitable organizations and community
initiatives.

"We believe voluntary restraint of the number and placement of
messages about products that may not be sold to minors is appropriate

OUTLOOK FOR TOBACCO FOR 1973 AND LONGER RANGE PROSPECTS

Talk by Robert H. Miller

at the 1973 National Agricultural Outlook Conference
Washington, D.C., November 28, 1973

Demand for tobacco is on the rise. At home, per capita cigarette use is posting its sixth jump to 30.5-cigs per day and there is a flurry of cigarillo and pipe tobacco sales. Abroad, demand is strong, particularly in Japan ("promotion" in Eng.) grower interest has been stimulated by high prices. State quotas are expected to be increased this year. Tobacco farmers are expected to acquire more tobacco so that they can meet the demands.

The looming questions affecting outlook "how low will demand hold up?" and “what about the public’s health?” The latter is a growing concern for the public's mind with other issues of consumer protection and pollution.  We must consider these factors as we look to our place in the expanding world tobacco market. Before tackling the longer range prospects, let’s first focus on the year just past and the immediate outlook.

Tobacco Products

U.S. cigarette consumption reached a record 99.8 billion cigarettes last year, up 1.3 percent from 1971.  Per capita use rose to 30.5 cigarettes per day, and over, in 1972 about 1,050,000 cigarettes cost the same as 1964. This is a significant increase in cigarette consumption. The price of cigarettes has risen sharply since 1964 due to excise taxes.

Retail cigarette prices rose 5 percent in 1972, due to increases to state and federal excise taxes.  Cigarillo sales increased 13 percent last year, while pipe tobacco sales climbed 10 percent.  The average retail price per pound of smoking tobacco was $2.48 in December 1972.

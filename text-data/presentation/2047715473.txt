PHILIP MORRIS APPLAUDS
RULING ALLOWING CASTANO APPEAL

Philip Morris is very pleased by a ruling today issued by U.S. District Judge
Okla Jones in the Castano class action case in New Orleans. Judge Jones granted a
motion filed by Philip Morris and the other defendants to allow them to pursue an
immediate appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of his decision to certify certain
common issues for class handling.

Charles Wall, senior vice president and associate general counsel at Philip
Morris, applauded the decision, saying it was the common-sense way to manage the
litigation.

"This case presents many important legal issues that will inevitably be decided
by the Fifth Circuit, and it makes sense to have these issues decided now, before both
sides embark on lengthy and costly pretrial proceedings and preparation," Wall said.

Judge Jones also granted the defendants’ motion to stay all proceedings in the
trial court until the Fifth Circuit has ruled on the issue of class certification.

The companies believe that certification was improper in part, because
individual issues predominate. Philip Morris and the other defendants now plan to ask
the Fifth Circuit to decertify the Castano class.

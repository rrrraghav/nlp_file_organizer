STATEMENT BY PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.

NEW YORK, March 15, 1996 -- Today, the Liggett Group, the smallest of
the five U.S. tobacco companies, announced its intention to settle lawsuits
which five states filed to recover Medicaid funds spent to treat patients with
alleged smoking related illnesses.

Today’s announcement, like the proposed settlement announced in
Castano earlier this week, does not change our view of the litigation we are
defending. We remain confident in the strength of our litigation position. We
intend to fight and to prevail. We do not intend to settle.

The attempt by Liggett to settle these cases is a ploy by corporate raiders
Bennett LeBow and Carl Ichan to gain control of RJR Nabisco.

Lawsuits are decided on the facts and the law. The facts have not
changed and the law has not changed. We intend to fight and we intend to win.

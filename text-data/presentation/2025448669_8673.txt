VQA CAPACITY ISSUE

INTRODUCTION

SINCE 1989, A VISUAL QUALITY METHOD BASED ON WELL DEFINED STANDARDS
IS IN USE AT PM E-R&D. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED TO AUDIT AFFILIATES’
PRODUCTION AS OF 1991 AND LICENSEES' PRODUCTION AS OF 1992.

PM E-R&D PROVIDES ITS CENTRAL AUDIT SERVICES TO ALL PRODUCTION
CENTRES OF THE REGION ENABLING THUS COMPARISONS BASED ON A
COMMON STANDARD METHOD.

IN THE MEANTIME, AFFILIATES HAVE ADOPTED THE METHOD (FTR IN 1992...PMG
IN 1994). THIS IMPLEMENTATION COULD NOW ENABLE TO DIRECTLY COMPARE
RESULTS GENERATED BY THESE FACTORIES WITH THE ADVANTAGE THAT
RESULT IS BASED ON A LARGER SAMPLE.

NOT ALL LICENSEES FACTORIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE VISUAL QUALITY
METHOD AND THEREFORE, THEIR QUALITY CANNOT BE ASSESSED WITHOUT
AUDITING CENTRALLY THEIR PRODUCTION.

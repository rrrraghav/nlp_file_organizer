FOR USE ON AND AFTER SUNDAY, JANUARY 3 1971

A cigarette industry spokesman looked ahead today to
1971 as a year of "sharply reduced noise level" in the smoking
and health controversy and said this could provide for a speedup
of its scientific resolution.

Horace R. Kornegay, president of The Tobacco Institute,
said that “the reduction of cigarette advertising, as formalized
in law after the industry’s voluntary proposal to quit its broad-
cast advertising, will mean nothing unless it paves the way for a
sharp increase in scientific attention to this controversy that
is long overdue.

"It has been seven years since the Surgeon General's
Advisory Committee issued its report on smoking and health,"
Kornegay said.

“In these years, instead of a massive assault on the
scientific mysteries of reported associations between smoking and
illness, many of the competent research support sources have
diverted publicly collected funds into wholesale anti-cigarette
propaganda.”

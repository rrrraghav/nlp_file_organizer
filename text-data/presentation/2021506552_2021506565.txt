THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. TODAY, I WILL BE REVIEWING THE
MOST IMPORTANT MARKETPLACE DEVELOPMENTS AND SALES TRENDS FOR
THE INDUSTRY AND FOR PHILLIP MORRIS.

1983 WAS A TURBULENT YEAR IN THE CIGARETTE MARKET. THE
PASSAGE OF THE BILL IN AUGUST 1982 WHICH DOUBLED THE FEDERAL
EXCISE TAX ON CIGARETTES WAS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE
TURBULENCE. THE FEDERAL TAX WENT FROM 8¢ TO 16¢ A PACK AND
TOOK EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 1983.

THE IMPOSITION OF THE FEDERAL EXCISE TAX INCREASE TRIGGERED
A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT HAD A HARSH IMPACT ON THE
INDUSTRY’S 1983 PERFORMANCE. SHIPMENTS FELL FROM 622
BILLION UNITS IN 1982 TO 596 BILLION THIS YEAR. THIS WAS A
LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 26 BILLION UNITS, OR 4.2%.

FROM 1974 THROUGH 1981, INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS GREW AT A SLOW
BUT STEADY PACE. DURING THIS TIME, THE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE
WAS 1.1%. HOWEVER, IN 1982, THE INDUSTRY SUFFERED A SHIPMENT
DECLINE WHICH THEN SHARPLY ACCELERATED IN 1983. THIS
DECREASE WIPED OUT THE ACCUMULATED SALES GAINS OF THE PAST

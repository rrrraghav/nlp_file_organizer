AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR RESPIRATORY CARE:
THE VOICE FOR THE RESPIRATORY CARE PROFESSION

Founded in 1947 in Chicago, Illinois, the AARC is the professional association
for respiratory therapists and technicians and others involved in pulmonary
and respiratory-related fields. The AARC has grown from a membership of 59 in
1947 to its current membership of more than 27,000. A network of 50 state
organizations involve members in state and local activities. Members include
respiratory therapists, respiratory technicians, pulmonary laboratory techni-
cians, nurses, physicians, home health providers, home medical equipment sup-
pliers, industrial sales representatives, manufacturers of respiratory care
equipment, and respiratory patients.

Now based in Dallas, Texas, the AARC provides its members with benefits and
services to enhance their personal and professional career goals. These
respiratory therapy practitioners work with patients in hospitals, the home
and nursing homes.

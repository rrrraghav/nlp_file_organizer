TOBACCO INDUSTRY FILES SUIT AGAINST FDA; KESSLER

Plaintiffs Describe FDA Action as Trojan Horse;
Real Intent is Regulation of Industry, Adult Choice.

NEW YORK -- The five U.S. cigarette manufacturers and a North Carolina advertising agency today filed suit against the Food and Drug Administration and Commissioner David Kessler, charging that the agency cannot reach beyond its statutory authority to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes.

The suit asks the court to prevent the FDA from taking any action to regulate cigarettes and to order that the proposed regulations be withdrawn because they are illegal.

The FDA action defies decades of Congressional and FDA declarations that the agency has no jurisdiction over tobacco products, said Steve Parrish, Philip Morris Companies Inc., senior vice president of Corporate Affairs, speaking on behalf of the industry.

Parrish said the action also violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.

The suit was filed after Kessler initiated a rule-making procedure to regulate nicotine in cigarettes as a drug and cigarettes themselves as devices that deliver nicotine, a position that Parrish characterized as "absurd" and one that defies common sense.

“David Kessler is trying to sneak through the back door because Congress has repeatedly slammed shut the front door on the issue of regulating cigarettes under the same law the FDA applies to products sold for therapeutic or medicinal purposes,” Parrish said.

“Kessler’s action can only be described as a Trojan Horse, set forward under the guise of preventing youth smoking, a goal everyone shares," Parrish said. "Make no mistake; the real hidden agenda here is prohibition.”

Parrish said despite Commissioner Kessler's stated intention to address only youth smoking issues, a letter dated Feb. 25, 1994, indicates more ominous intent.

NEW REPORT ON HEALTH EFFECTS OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION

A major new report into the health effects of some key indoor air pollutants in the home, published today (23/5/96), suggests that house dust mites and nitrogen dioxide (from gas cookers) are likely to be the greatest source of airborne health problems in the home.

The report, IEH Assessment on Indoor Air Quality in the Home, was produced for the Department of the Environment by the Medical Research Council’s Institute for Environment and Health in Leicester. It looks at five types of pollutants in the home - nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds (including benzene and common solvents), house dust mites and fungi and bacteria. Using data from the Building Research Establishment, also released in a report today, it evaluates the potential adverse health effects of these pollutants and puts the findings in a national and international perspective.

The report recognises that the risks to health from dust mites and nitrogen dioxide are not known, but nonetheless recommends a reduction in exposure. Whilst the other pollutants studied may be hazardous, the report concludes that there is no evidence that current levels in UK homes pose a risk to health. But, as a general principle, it recommends reducing the levels of indoor pollutants as a prudent measure.

As well as taking an overview of current knowledge, the report identifies a number of important areas for future research. These include studies to: evaluate the potential health benefits from reducing levels of dust mites; establish clearly whether or not high NO2 levels cause

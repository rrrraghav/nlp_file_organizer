CIGARETTE FIRE DEATHS : A MAJOR RESEARCH EFFORT

Experts from government, industry and public safety organizations
have begun a program that has a major potential to reduce U.S.
fire deaths. During 1988, cigarettes started more than 230,000
fires that caused about 1600 deaths, 3,700 serious injuries, and
$423 million of destroyed property. About one of every three
fire deaths occurs in a cigarette-ignited fire. These losses are
a major reason why the United States has one of the worst fire
death rates in the world. The program is being conducted under
the Fire-Safe Cigarette Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-352). Prior work
by the same group under P.L. 98-567 (the Cigarette Safety Act
of 1984) had found that, "It is technically feasible and may be
commercially feasible to develop cigarettes that will have a
significantly reduced propensity to ignite upholstered
furniture or mattresses".

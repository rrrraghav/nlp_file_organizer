Philip Morris U.S.A. Announces Initiative
Against Youth Smoking

NEW YORK, June 27, 1995 -- Philip Morris U.S.A. today launched a new initiative to attack the problem of youth smoking. The program -- Action Against Access -- has been created to make it as difficult as possible for minors to purchase cigarettes.

"The best way to keep kids away from cigarettes is to keep cigarettes away from kids," Philip Morris U.S.A. President and CEO James J. Morgan said, in announcing the program. It includes unilateral steps such as discontinuing free cigarette sampling to consumers and the distribution of Philip Morris cigarettes by mail. The Company also announced that it will include a notice on its cartons and packs indicating that the sale of cigarettes to minors is prohibited.

In addition, the Company indicated that it will withhold merchandising benefits from stores which are fined for or convicted of breaking minimum age laws. And Philip Morris U.S.A. will fund a major retail compliance training program called "Ask First/It's the Law" on how to ask for and verify proof of age for the purchase of cigarettes.

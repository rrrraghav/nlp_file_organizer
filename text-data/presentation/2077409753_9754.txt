PHILIP MORRIS PLEASED
WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON'S RESPONSE
TO YOUTH SMOKING PROPOSAL

NEW YORK, May 16, 1996 -- Philip Morris U.S.A. issued the
following statement in response to comments made today by
President Clinton on the company’s proposal to address
 underage tobacco use.

“We are pleased that the President has recognized our good
faith efforts to end underage tobacco use. We look forward to
continuing the dialogue we began yesterday with the
President, Congress and others,” said Steven C. Parrish,
senior vice president, corporate affairs, Philip Morris
Companies Inc.

"We believe with the leadership of the President and that of
the leaders of both parties in Congress, we can achieve a
breakthrough in the fight to end underage use of tobacco."

Parrish also said "we renew our challenge to others,
especially anti-tobacco groups, to join with us and others in
support of immediate action to attack the problem of tobacco
use by minors.”

On Wednesday Philip Morris announced a blueprint for
comprehensive federal legislation to address concerns
regarding the use of tobacco products by minors and called on
Congress to enact it swiftly.

President Clinton, speaking at Georgetown University, made
the following comments regarding the Philip Morris proposal:

“We got some indication yesterday that we may even wind up
with an agreement with the private sector in this effort that
we’ve been so intensely involved in to try to curb teenage
smoking, when Philip Morris and the U.S. Tobacco Company
indicated that they would agree to legislation to limit sales
of tobacco to children and to reduce advertising of tobacco
that affects nation's children, and I want to thank them
for that.”

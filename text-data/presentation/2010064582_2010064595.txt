THAT’S GREAT TOBACCO! - BUT WILL IT SMOKE?*

WHEN WE EVALUATE TOBACCO, MOST OF US IN THE LEAF END OF
THE BUSINESS GENERALLY DIRECT OUR OBSERVATIONS TOWARD HOW
TOBACCO LOOKS IN THE FIELD, AT THE POINT OF SALE AND IN
STRIP FORM. THAT VIEWPOINT IS ENTIRELY LOGICAL. IT IS
ALSO THE TRADITIONAL POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER, IT IS
EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED.

IN TODAY’S WORLD OF HIGHLY DEVELOPED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,
IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BASE OUR DECISIONS AND JUDGEMENTS
SOLELY ON THE ART OF OUR TRADE AS HAS BEEN DONE FOR CENTURIES.
MORE CONSIDERATION AND ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE
CHEMISTRY OF THE BASIC RAW MATERIAL AND WHAT EFFECT IT WILL
HAVE ON THE FINAL PRODUCT. IT HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY MANDITORY
THAT OUR COMPANY PLACE IN THE MARKETPLACE HIGH QUALITY
PRODUCTS WITH SMOKE COMPONENT DELIVERIES WITHIN CERTAIN
LIMITS OF VERY NARROW PARAMETERS. THIS NECESSITATES THAT
WE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED AND SCIENTIFIC IN THE PROCUREMENT
OF OUR LEAF TOBACCOS.

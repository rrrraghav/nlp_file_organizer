Thanks, ———

I’m very pleased to be here today. It's
always a pleasure to get together with
members of the distribution community,
and I think you’ll agree that we have a lot
to talk about.

The last time we met, I discussed
Philip Morris' blueprint for Federal
legislation to help prevent access to
cigarettes by minors. Since then, events
have moved more rapidly than any of us
could have imagined.

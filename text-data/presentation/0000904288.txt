STANDARD ASBESTOS FILES CROSS COMPLAINT AGAINST TOBACCO INDUSTRY

Standard Asbestos Manufacturing & Insulating Co. began filing cross
complaints against tobacco companies alleging that the industry’s efforts
to hook cigarette smokers solely responsible for any damage awards,
including those arising from asbestos-related diseases (See P. 3,281).

The action is the first ever against the tobacco industry stemming
from asbestos litigation. Standard alleges that because smokers are
at a greater risk of death from lung cancer than those who
do not smoke, and because cigarette companies know this, they should
be held responsible for any damages caused by their products.
Essentially, Standard is claiming that...

…the tobacco industry’s aggressive marketing, murder, not only in
America's lungs, but also in Standard’s courtroom, holds the tobacco
industry accountable for the damage inflicted on the call for all
of us.

The cross complaints, filed in more than 600 cases in the
Superior Court of California, seek to shift the financial burden
of asbestos claims from Standard Asbestos Manufacturing & Insulating Co.,
Phillips Morris, Inc.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Inc.; Liggett Group,
Inc.; Lorillard World Distribution Company; and American British
Tobacco Industries, Inc.

Opening Remarks by Geoff Bible
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Philip Morris Companies Inc.

I know I don’t have to tell you how big we are and what we make. You know all that.

The question for you, and for us, is where are we going with all this power.

That is the real subject of today's meeting. Over the course of this afternoon we will show you that we have outstanding share positions, enviable margins and powerful momentum going forward.

You will hear more from the executives who run our businesses, and who manage our legal and public policy positions.

After a review of our financial condition, I will return with a quick conclusion, and we will then take questions.

By the end of the afternoon, I hope you will see that we have a great set of businesses, and an absolutely terrific leadership team in place to make them really catch fire.

First, I want to make it crystal clear that we are completely focused on the two key goals Bill Murray and I described last June:

increasing our earnings by growing our tobacco, food and beer businesses,
and, second by
increasing returns to stockholders.

We are accomplishing our first goal by increasing our earnings, and growing our businesses, at a rapid clip.

Last year, our operating companies income grew 13%, net earnings were up 174% and net earnings per share reached $5.45, matching the records we set in 1992.

This is truly a remarkable recovery and gives us a solid base from which to set new records in 1995.

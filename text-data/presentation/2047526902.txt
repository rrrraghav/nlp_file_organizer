PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT
TO PREVENT YOUTH SMOKING

Philip Morris U.S.A. does not want children to smoke and markets its cigarettes only to adults who have made the informed decision to smoke. Anti-smoking groups should realize that when it comes to youth smoking, this is one issue where we are both on the same side.

[] We worked to enact and continue to support laws which require a minimum age of 18 years to purchase cigarettes.

[] We developed a national retail program called "It's the Law" in cooperation with the National Association of Convenience Stores to help retailers and their employees obey local age requirements for the sale of tobacco products. The program provides educational brochures and signage to retailers, free of charge, which announces "It’s the Law, We Do Not Sell Tobacco Products to Persons Under 18." The industry now has endorsed this program in cooperation with more than 100 state co-sponsoring associations.

As millions of Californians stream
to the polls on Election Day to
vote on an issue which could
send the entire tobacco industry up
in smoke. From the state that
brought us Proposition 13, comes
Proposition 5, a well-organized, yet
financially outmatched campaign to
ban smoking in nearly all indoor
public places in California. While
supporters of the ban, many of
whom belong to the Californians
for Clean Indoor Air, say they will
be lucky to raise $500,000 for their
cause, the $17-billion-a-year to-
bacco industry will end up spend-
ing some $5 million just to combat
the measure.

Comedian Johnny Carson
quipped on his show several weeks
ago that the polls in the state
showed 53% for Proposition 5.
“The other 47%, he said, ‘are
dead.’ Jokes like that produce no
smiles on the face of William F.
Dwyer, vice-president of the To-
bacco Institute, a Washington-
based organization that lobbies for
the tobacco companies which sup-
port it. It is after all his con-
tention that smoking has never
been linked causally to any disease,
despite claims to the contrary by
the American Medical Association.
Reader’s Digest (which Dwyer
wirily calls “the country’s foremost
medical journal”) and any number
of anti-smoking groups.

Dwyer says the Institute doesn't
encourage or discourage smoking.
Rather, it attempts to keep the de-
bate between tobacco and health
adversaries "robust and uninhib-
ited.” A pack-a-day smoker himself,
Dwyer says the Institute does not
make smoking a condition for em-
ployment. “We regard tobacco use
as an adult custom - not chil-
dren - to be decided on by mature
minahs."

Tobacco is changing the way it
deals with the controversy, largely
due to pressure from anti-tobacco forces in government.

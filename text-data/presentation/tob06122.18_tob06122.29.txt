REMARKS OF
HORACE R. KORNEGAY
Annual Meeting
December 8, 1977

Presidents of trade associations, like politicians
to whom they are closely related, are susceptible to
a common occupational hazard.

They run an excessive risk of seeing the world in
shades that are either too rosy or too gloomy. This
causes them to color their public utterances accordingly.

There is only one sure remedy -- objectivity. And
so today I intend to give you an unvarnished report of where
we have come from in the past year, where we stand now and
where we are going in the year ahead.

1977 has been a year of decision for the Institute and
the industry. Overall, our greatest achievements have
been in the facing up to -- and the making of -- some
difficult decisions.

The first of these was your decision to approve the
Institute business plan, which places upon us the respon-
sibility to "lead and direct the resources of the industry."

The second was your decision to commit those resources
to us.

I want you to know that we are gratified that you have
backed up the words of the mission statement with the deed
of mobilizing your key executives and sales forces.

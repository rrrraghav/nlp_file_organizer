STATEMENT OF CURTIS H. JUDGE

ON HR 1824

BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT

OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE

March 17, 1983

I am Curtis H. Judge, President of Lorillard, a division of
Loews Corporation.

I am also the Chairman of the Executive Committee of The
Tobacco Institute, an association of tobacco manufacturers
with headquarters in Washington, D.C. I testify here today
on behalf of our industry.

With me today on this panel are Dr. Larry Light, Professor
Roger D. Blackwell and Professor Harold Mendelsohn. I am
also accompanied by Arthur J. Stevens, General Counsel of
Lorillard.

Before I go any further, I want to thank the Chairman for
the brief delay you granted us -- although two-and-a-half
hours today and part of a panel last week severely restrict
the ability of our industry’s witnesses, independent
scientific witnesses and others who oppose the bill to
appear. Consequently, many of those who wish to testify
will have to do so by means of filed statements.

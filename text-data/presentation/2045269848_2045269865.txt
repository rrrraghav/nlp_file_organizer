① Catalog Cover Slide
Good Morning, It’s a pleasure to be
here today to discuss an important and
growing segment of Marlboro’s
promotional arsenal -- continuity
programs. In the next half hour, I’ll
review both the Marlboro Adventure
Team and its successor, the Marlboro
Country Store. I’ll highlight what went
right, -- and there's alot to be proud of
-- and also talk about areas where we
need to learn and improve.

⑤ Mat Red Roof Slide
Let’s begin with Marlboro
Adventure Team, the most successful
consumer products promotion in
history. The Adventure Team
Promotion was one of the boldest,
gutsiest decisions ever taken by PM-
USA. Like the trip itself, the promotion
was not for the faint of heart. More
importantly, it established many firsts
and provided a foundation for
Marlboro’s future promotional
strategy.

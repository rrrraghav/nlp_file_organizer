NEWS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NO IMMEDIATE CHANGE IN CIGARETTE MARKETING
DESPITE SUPREME COURT RULING

OTTAWA, September 21, 1995 – Pending consultation with the federal government. Canada's three largest tobacco manufacturers will maintain the status quo in the advertising, marketing and promotion of tobacco products despite today’s Supreme Court ruling declaring the Tobacco Products Control Act (TPCA) invalid.

The Supreme Court ruled that the TPCA is unconstitutional because it contravenes the right of free speech, including commercial free speech, as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court further confirmed that tobacco advertising and promotion control falls under federal jurisdiction.

“We appeal the fact that the Court has affirmed that a company producing a legal product has the fundamental right to communicate with its customers,” said Robert Parker, President of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers’ Council, which represents the country's three largest tobacco companies, in a statement released today in Ottawa.

"These are important legal decisions with long-term implications," he added. "The industry has therefore already advised governments of the companies’ intentions to maintain, for a reasonable period of time, the status quo with regard to all advertising, marketing and promotion of tobacco products to permit consultations to take place with appropriate government authorities.”

“We recognize that the Supreme Court's decision has altered the legal landscape in terms of future tobacco control and regulations, which will require detailed study and consultation by the industry, its member companies and governments."

The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers’ Council represents Imperial Tobacco Ltd., RJR-Macdonald Inc. and Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc.

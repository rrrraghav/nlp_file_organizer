Hans G. Storr —

Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be in Tokyo again.

Today, I will discuss our growing international tobacco and food operations.

Hoby Millington, whom many of you already know, will review our strong domestic businesses.

I will return with some remarks about our sound financial base.

[pause]

First, I should put our remarks in context.

We see 1993 as a year of achievement.

It is true that, because of the costs of our domestic tobacco initiatives, 1993 underlying net earnings per share were 16% lower than in 1992. And overall, our restructuring charge and accounting change cut reported earnings by another dollar-eight per share.

More importantly, we emerged from the year stronger and more competitive for the future.

As Hoby Millington will show you, we took the right actions, and we are getting the right results, in our domestic tobacco business.

We continued to grow and invest in our businesses for the long term.

Our 1993 revenues set a new record of nearly 61 billion dollars,
up almost 2 billion.

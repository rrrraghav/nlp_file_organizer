News Summary

As to bronchitis and emphysema, "there is insufficient
evidence for attributing an established causal role in
these conditions to cigarette smoking."

"There is no evidence of which I am aware that constituents
of cigarette smoke have the capacity to produce dissolution
of lung tissue (emphysema)."

collected in St. Louis and Winnipeg, when all other para-
meters including smoking were controlled, "we found that in
these two cities, with their known differences in climate
and industrialization, the St. Louis lungs revealed earlier
development and a more severe degree of emphysema than
comparable lungs from the prairie city of Winnipeg. One
of our conclusions was that industrial pollution had a
demonstrable influence..."

at autopsy. "We must conclude that the diagnosis of emphysema

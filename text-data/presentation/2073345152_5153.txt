MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE STUDY
FINDS NO RISK

LOUISVILLE, KY – New research from one of the world’s premier health
organizations is out on environmental tobacco smoke.

In the largest study of its kind ever performed in Europe, research by the World
Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has found no
meaningful increase in lung cancer risk to non-smokers exposed to environmental tobacco
smoke.

“This is good news for smokers and non-smokers,” said Dr. Sharon Boyce,
director of scientific communications at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation. “We
welcome this new study which confirms what we and many other scientists have long
believed, that while smoke in the air may annoy some non-smokers, the science overall
does not show that being around a smoker is a lung cancer risk,” she said.

“This IARC study represents many years of research across several European
countries. Whether this study is considered alone, or as the latest of more than 40 studies
of this type over the last 17 years, the data do not show any meaningful increase in risk
of lung cancer for a non-smoker exposed to environmental tobacco smoke,” she said.

The overwhelming majority of statistical studies investigating whether tobacco
smoke in the air might be associated with lung cancer in non-smokers have reported no
meaningful increase in risk. In the minority of studies that indicate the possibility of an
increase in risk, that increase has been shown to be so small under normal scientific
standards it is impossible to conclude that it is real.

INFORMATIONAL RELEASE

April 20, 2000

TO: ALL CIGARETTE WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF OTHER
TOBACCO PRODUCTS

RE: MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

The State of Ohio is a signatory to the agreement that was reached with various cigarette
manufacturers/importers and states. This agreement is commonly known as the Master
Settlement Agreement (MSA).

Ohio’s participation in the MSA mandated legislation requiring manufacturers who are
not signatories to the MSA to pay into an escrow account a sum roughly equivalent to
that which is paid by the participating manufacturers. This legislation also requires the
Department of Taxation to gather information concerning sales of cigarettes and roll-
your-own tobacco into Ohio that is manufactured by non-participants to the agreement.
This information will be provided to the Ohio Attorney General for use in administering
the agreement. An administrative rule requiring this information is in the process of
being filed with an anticipated effective date in early May (copy enclosed).



Schedule of Brands Covered by the MSA

A schedule of brands covered by the MSA is enclosed. This schedule has been sorted
two ways, alphabetically by brand name and alphabetically by manufacturer/importer.
Only brands that are not on this list must be reported. Updated lists of covered brands
will be provided as changes occur.

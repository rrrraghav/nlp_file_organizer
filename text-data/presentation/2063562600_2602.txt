PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. CALLS FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION
TO STOP underage SMOKING

COMPANY OUTLINES COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT
FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION

NEW YORK, May 15, 1996 – Philip Morris U.S.A., the domestic tobacco subsidiary of Philip
Morris Companies Inc., today announced a blueprint for comprehensive federal legislation to
address concerns regarding the use of tobacco products by minors and called on Congress to enact
it swiftly.

“Everyone agrees that kids shouldn’t use tobacco,” said Steven Parrish, senior vice president,
corporate affairs, Philip Morris Companies Inc. “And all reasonable people agree that adults
should be able to smoke or use smokeless tobacco if they want to.”

“Last week, President Clinton spoke to a group of high school students in Woodbridge, New
Jersey, about tobacco,” Parrish said. “The President directed some of his comments to the tobacco
industry, saying ‘do not stand outside of and apart from this debate.’ And he went on to say: ‘Join
with us. Do the right thing.’ We are proposing far-reaching and unprecedented federal legislation
on the issue of underage use of tobacco. And we will be actively seeking support for
this initiative.”

“This initiative builds on our fundamental commitment to the propositions that minors should not
use -- or even have access to -- tobacco products,” Parrish said. “Anyone who violates these
principles should feel the full weight of the law.”

“A federal law makes sense because it can be implemented quickly, avoiding protracted litigation
over the Food and Drug Administration’s illegal attempt to regulate tobacco products,” Parrish
said.

“The President has said that we have a right to market our products to adults. He has also said he
would welcome Congressional action instead of waiting for a long, complicated, contentious
regulatory proceeding or years of litigation. Let me quote the President directly: ‘If you would
rather have a law than federal regulation, the FDA Director, Dr. Kessler, and I would rather have
an immediate impact on teen smoking not two years of litigation and then start the work,’

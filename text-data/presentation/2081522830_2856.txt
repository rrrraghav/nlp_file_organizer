Dear Allen,

I guess you’re in for a surprise. The MPR has moved to July 26th instead of August 9th.
Attached is the “latest” report that will tell all about what Judy and I have done.
Attached your original response to likely content inside of the last bulletin.
I still need your input from July 12th - the best you can do is to log for as applied. The
new dates are suggested so Judy should schedule her needs for the spreadsheet.
If there are additional changes she knows mostly I will forward those appropriate to you.
Thanks for your insights and assistance in this process.

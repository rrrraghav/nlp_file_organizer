SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE EPA REPORT
"RESPIRATORY EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKING: LUNG CANCER
AND OTHER DISORDERS."

Presentation made on 2/2/94 to
FORSYTH COUNTY BOARD OF HEALTH,
by Dr. Chris Coggins, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

1. This talk is entitled "Scientific Assessment of
the EPA report: Respiratory Effects of Pas-
sive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other
Disorders." There are a number of legislative
actions that are being proposed that are all based on this EPA report.
This paper reviews some of the science in that report. The talk is a
reduced version of one given at the recent National ETS Conference in
Washington, DC. This talk was broadcast live on C-SPAN: video
tapes are available.

2. Each of the approaches used by the EPA
contain major errors. The EPA followed
faulty methodology and did not follow its
own guidelines. The scientific data obtained
from the different approaches are very fragile
and the data do not converge to a common conclusion.

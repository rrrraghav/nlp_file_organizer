This is Lorillard’s Domestic Cigarette Marketing Plan
for 5 years, 1976 through 1980.

- Each of you has his own copy of this plan, which will
be given to you at the completion of our presentation.

I will present the contents of the Plan as they exist
in written form, adding nothing and omitting nothing,
except selected detail.

- Much of the Plan I will read verbatim while highlighting
by these charts.

- As we proceed through the Plan, the detail will become
greater. In all areas I will try to provide you with
an overview before adding supportive detail.

- At the end of the written plan are a series of exhibits -
the first three, of which, I have on charts. I want
to describe them to you first before presentation.

Each of these three exhibits, I, II and III, detail
Lorillard sales volume from 1974 through 1980,
by year
by brand
by packing
to Lorillard Total Net Sales Volume
Exhibit I is our Basic Plan, the achievement of which in
total sales units we commit ourselves
to, today.

Exhibit II also projects sales through 1980 but based upon
successfully restaging established
brands towards growth or greater
growth.

Exhibit III also projects sales through 1980 not only based
upon restaging successes but also
on greater new products contribution.

Therefore, we are committing to the Basic 5 Year Plan sales
targets in Exhibit I, while detailing our greater goals in
Exhibits II and III.

That’s where we will end up this presentation - just as does
the Plan.

To begin, therefore, let me read the end - called Performance
Review.

READ PERFORMANCE REVIEW SECTION.

Having hinted at the end, let me now begin at the beginning.

OSHA PROPOSES INDOOR AIR QUALITY, WORKPLACE SMOKING RULES

In an effort to secure a safe and healthful work environment
for America's workforce, Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich today
announced the department’s Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) is moving to regulate indoor air quality
and environmental tobacco smoke.

"Every day in this country more than 20 million working men
and women face unnecessary health threats because of poor indoor
air quality and environmental tobacco smoke," Reich said. "The
proposed rule is designed to tackle these problems.

"We are confident that compliance with the rule will reduce
the suffering and disease associated with poor indoor air quality
and environmental tobacco smoke. OSHA has taken this action to
prevent thousands of heart disease deaths, hundreds of lung
cancer deaths, and the respiratory diseases and other ailments
linked to these hazards," said Reich.

According to Reich, "the proposed rule is an investment in
prevention. Lives will be saved, health care costs reduced and
productivity increased."

DRAFT 11/13/86

Remarks by
Hamish Maxwell
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Philip Morris Companies Inc.

Forum Club Dinner
The Commonwealth Club
Richmond, Virginia

Monday, November 17, 1986

Philip Morris unquestionably has changed since I
first came to Richmond 32 years ago. Even so,
there's been remarkable continuity: For all the new
products we now market, tobacco remains the core of
our strength.

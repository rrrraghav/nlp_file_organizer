SPEECH BY HAMISH MAXWELL

GIVEN AT CORPORATE AFFAIRS CONFERENCE

SEPTEMBER 8, 1986. WASHINGTON D.C.

WELCOME

IT’S TWO YEARS SINCE THE LAST CORPORATE AFFAIRS CONFERENCE. AT
THAT TIME, HUGH CULLMAN, JOHN MURPHY, STANLEY SCOTT, I AND OTHERS
WERE NEW IN OUR JOBS AND CONSIDERING OUR PRIORITIES.

TODAY, I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FOUR OF THOSE PRIORITIES;
HOW I BELIEVE WE ARE MANAGING THEM -- AND WHERE I BELIEVE PHILIP
MORRIS IS GOING WITH THEM.

THE PRIORITIES I WILL SPEAK ABOUT ARE:

ONE: TO REDEFINE WHAT KIND OF COMPANY P.M. SHOULD BE AND WHAT
KIND OF BUSINESS IT SHOULD CONDUCT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE ITS
VALUE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND ITS BENEFITS TO OUR EMPLOYEES.

TWO: TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN ALL THE BUSINESSES TO WHICH WE
COMMIT OURSELVES.

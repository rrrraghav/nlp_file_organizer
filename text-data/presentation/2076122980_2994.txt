THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR
WORK ON THE USE OF CIRCULAR DICHROISM AS A PROCESS
MONITOR FOR ALKALOID EXTRACTION.

THIS WORK WAS CONDUCTED A FEW YEARS AGO
WHEN PHILIP MORRIS USA WAS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF A PROCESS FOR ALKALOID REDUCTION IN TOBACCO USING
SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE EXTRACTION.

THE OUTCOME OF THIS WORK LED TO A PATENTED
APPLICATION OF CIRCULAR DICHROISM (CD) AS A MONITOR FOR
THE EXTRACTION PROCESS.

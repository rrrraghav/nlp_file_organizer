WAR-BORN FILTER USED
TO REMOVE TARS AND
NICOTINE IN CIGARETTE

Lorillard Introduces Kent Cigarettes With Built-In Filter Using Similar
Ingredient To Atomic Plants -- Eliminates 7 Times More
Tars and Nicotine Than Heretofore --

New York, March 19: A new cigarette with a built-in filter
which removes seven times more tars and nicotine than any
cigarette filter heretofore developed was introduced here today
by P. Lorillard Company under the brand name Kent.

The ingredient which accomplishes this unprecedented degree
of filtration is currently used to remove radio-active materials
from the air at plants of the Atomic Energy Commission and is
said to be the most effective filter material yet commercially
available. Its adaptation to a cigarette is the culmination of
months of intensive research and development work in Lorillard’s
Research Laboratories under the direction of Dr. Harris B. Parmelee,
research director of the company. Research consultants from
abroad and from American colleges assisted in this work.

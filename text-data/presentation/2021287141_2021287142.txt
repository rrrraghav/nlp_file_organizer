Marlboro Press Conference
Dallas, Contoy of Texas - Nov. 17/71

MANY OF US HERE TODAY WERE WITNESS 18
YEARS AGO TO THE BIRTH OF A NEW STATE--A
STATE OF MIND RECOGNIZED ALL OVER THE WORLD
AS BEING WHERE THE FLAVOR IS...MARLBORO
COUNTRY. IN BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO
HELPED CREATE MARLBORO COUNTRY, IT IS MY
PRIVILEGE TO WELCOME YOU.

THE MARLBORO STORY--WHICH WE ARE
CELEBRATING TODAY--IS A CLASSIC MARKETING
SUCCESS STORY. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE
BRAND'S REMARKABLE GROWTH DURING THESE 18
YEARS HAS BEEN THAT MARLBORO HAS SATISFIED
THE DESIRES OF THE SMOKER NO MATTER WHAT HIS
PREFERENCES IN LENGTH, STYLE OR PACKAGING,
AND NO MATTER WHERE IN THE WORLD HE LIVES.
IN 1954 WE INTRODUCED MARLBORO FLAVOR IN
THE FLIP-TOP BOX TO AMERICA. THEN WE ADDED
THE SOFT PACK. LATER CAME THE INTRODUCTION
OF MARLBORO MENTHOL. MORE RECENTLY WE
INTRODUCED MARLBORO LONGHORN 100'S FOR THOSE
WHO PREFERRED THE EXTRA LENGTH OF THE HUNDRED
MILLIMETER CIGARETTE. THE ACCENT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN ON A RICH, SATISFYING FLAVOR.

IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THE IMAGINATION OF
MALE SMOKERS, WE GAVE THE BRAND A DISTINCTLY
MASCULINE IMAGE. LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM AND
YOU BEGIN TO SEE HOW MARLBORO COUNTRY WAS
BORN. WE USED THE AMERICAN COWBOY IN OUR
ADVERTISING: ALL OF THEM MATURE MEN WHO
COULD SETTLE BACK AND RELAX WITH A MARLBORO.

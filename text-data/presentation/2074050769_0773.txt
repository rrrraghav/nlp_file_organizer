SATURDAY EVENING - 2/18/95
MR. BIBLE - '95 PMI SUGGESTED COMMENTS

(WILL BE INTRODUCED BY CRAIG FULLER)

THANK YOU CRAIG AND GOOD EVENING,

EVERYONE.

SARA AND I ARE DELIGHTED TO BE HERE AND
ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OF YOU, BETTER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR OUR
SCHEDULE ALLOWED US TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
PMI AND WE ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT.
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME WERE THE
OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD TO DISCUSS BOTH
YOUR’S AND OUR BUSINESSES AT THE SUNDAY

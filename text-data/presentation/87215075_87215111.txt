Since the late seventies, the number of scientific publications
discussing the alleged deleterious effects of environmental tobacco
smoke upon indoor air quality have mushroomed. The subject of
environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS, has become a major issue in
regard to indoor air quality largely due to recent reports by the
U. S. Surgeon General, the National Academy of Sciences, and the news
media. One critic in particular, in a series of publications in
scientific journals, concluded that passive smoking produces 5000
lung cancer deaths per year in U. S. nonsmokers.

And, these critical reports have been seemingly accepted by much of
the public, and the result has been much regulatory* and legislative
activity at the federal, state, and local level. Presently, there
are over six hundred approved bills that restrict smoking in
workplaces and restaurants in the United States, and the end is not
in sight.

Unfortunately, the conclusions of these reports were not based upon
significant numbers of reliable ETS measurements in indoor
environments. This view is supported by the fact that over the last
five years, three scientific conferences have been convened to review
the scientific literature regarding ETS. All three of the
conferences have concluded that the available scientific evidence

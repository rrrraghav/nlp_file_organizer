NICORETTE - THE FACTS

Q. What is NICORETTE?

A. NICORETTE is a sugarless, spiced chewing gum containing
nicotine and is specially formulated to help smokers break
the smoking habit. It is designed to provide partial
substitution for the nicotine in tobacco smoke, thereby
assisting the smoker to cope with both the psychological and
pharmacological effects of nicotine withdrawal.

Q. Will it help me to stop smoking?

A. NICORETTE has been clinically shown to double the success
rate of other methods. A recent study found 47 per cent of
the smokers using the nicotine chewing pieces were successful
in quitting at the end of one year.

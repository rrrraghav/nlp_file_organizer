 CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE
 SUPPORTS THE “FIRE SAFE CIGARETTE ACT”

Washington, DC — Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Houston) today joined her colleagues Congressman Joe Moakley (D-MA) and Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) along with members of the International Association of Fire Fighters in support of the Fire Safe Cigarette Act. “The country has a severe problem. Nationally there are thousands of deaths caused by fires; and careless smoking is the leading offender,” says Congresswoman Jackson Lee.

In 1997, there were 1,795,000 fires in the United States. The South and the Northeast share the highest death rate per capita with 17.5 civilian deaths per million population. Careless smoking is the leading cause of fire deaths. According to the National Fire Incident Reporting System, careless smoking accounts for 18% of residential fire deaths in Texas alone.

The Fire Safe Cigarette Act gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission the authority to develop a fire safety standard for cigarettes in 18 months and gives cigarette manufacturers a year to comply with that standard. The characteristics of a fire-safe cigarette are a filler tip, less porous paper, more expanded tobacco, smaller diameter and no citrate added to the paper.

“The U.S. fire problem is one of great national importance. We all can share in the solution by committing to this legislation,” concludes Congresswoman Jackson Lee.

Published Methods for the Determination of the Enantiomeric Purity of Nicotine

polarimetry - high sensitivity
requires extremely pure nicotine

1H-NMR/CLSR - low sensitivity
tolerates impurities

chromatographic separation of diastereomeric derivatives - high sensitivity
tolerates impurities
requires the absence of compounds interfering in the derivatization process

Method Developed at INBIFO (a)

direct chromatographic separation using chiral solid phases - high sensitivity
tolerates impurities
no derivatization necessary

STATEMENT BY ERNEST PEPPLES
VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL
BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION
JUNE 29, 1979

SUBJECT: Brown & Williamson’s Compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's
Subpoena to Produce 15 Years’ Worth of Marketing Material

For the past 3 years Brown & Williamson has been saddled with the
exceedingly burdensome demands of a Federal Government subpoena issued
by the Federal Trade Commission to all of the major tobacco companies,
their advertising agencies and trade associations. The FTC has asked for
copies of our file documents dating back to 1964 which relate to consumer
attitudes toward smoking and other advertising and marketing material.

We have made numerous inquiries to the FTC as to why it needs these
documents, and have received several answers, each about as clear as the
wording of the subpoena itself. (As an illustration, the subpoena contains a
single sentence made up of 131 words and 44 punctuation marks to define
the word “document.”*) An FTC attorney told the press in January, 1979 that
“the regulatory agency has no specific goals in mind” and “the FTC can issue
a subpoena just to satisfy its official curiosity."

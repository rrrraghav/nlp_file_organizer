from a total ban on smoking aboard airplanes to the complete
elimination of CAB regulation of in-flight smoking. Based on the
Board's experience with the existing regulations, as well as the
unequivocal congressional mandate for deregulation of the airlines,
the choice is clear: revocation of regulations governing smoking
aboard airplanes and leaving smoking, like other matters of pas-

acting in response to competitive market forces.

All other proposals should be rejected, particularly a
ban on smoking. The opponents of in-flight smoking have failed

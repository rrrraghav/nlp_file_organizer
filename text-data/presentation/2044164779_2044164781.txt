CIGARETTE COMPANIES ASK COURT
TO DECIDE CHALLENGE TO FDA AUTHORITY

NEW YORK, Oct. 5 -- The nation’s major tobacco companies have asked a
federal judge to rule on their challenge to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
asserted regulatory authority over cigarettes.

The companies’ request for a ruling, known as a motion for summary
judgment, is based on the industry’s view that the FDA lacks any legal authority
over cigarettes.

“There’s no reason that this case should take months or years to resolve,” said
Charles R. Wall, deputy general counsel and senior vice president at Philip Morris
Companies Inc. “The Court has the ability to decide the questions of the FDA's
authority now, and that’s what we’re asking the Court to do.”

“There is no need to spend months of time and millions of taxpayer dollars to
argue the merits or lack thereof of the various provisions of the agency’s August 10
filing with the Federal Register,” said Daniel W. Donahue, deputy general counsel

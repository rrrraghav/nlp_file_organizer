Perceptions and Facts about Youth Smoking

Youth smoking is increasing because of cigarette advertising.

Government data indicate the reverse: youth smoking has steadily declined since 1975, even though industry advertising has increased. Research shows that peer influence and parental example are the reasons why youth smoke, not advertising.

The vast majority of youth have never smoked cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control (the ’089 Teenage Attitudes and Practices Survey) shows that 69.5% of 10-to-17 years olds have never tried or smoked a whole cigarette; 16.6% experimented at some point, but don’t smoke.

The Department of Health and Human Services annual survey with 17,000 high-school seniors, conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, shows that over the past 15 years (’78 vs. ’93) a decline of smoking in every category they measure:

Percent Ever Tried   17.8% decline
Last in last 30 days  18.5% decline
Daily    20.4% decline
1 ½ pack daily     42.0% decline

The Gallup Organization reported in 1991 and 1993 in two surveys conducted on behalf of health interests that the principal influence in the decision to smoke was peer pressure and family influence (71% of respondents in 1993). Advertising was listed by 1% in 1991; it was not listed at all in 1993.

The Journal of School Health in May 1992 reported that the major reasons for 10th graders beginning to smoke were curiosity, social norms and peer pressure. Advertising was not mentioned. Regarding advertising, the author stated, “While there have been few tobacco advertising campaigns and some demographic changes, there is no basis for believing that vast for smoking have changed among adolescents.”

A recent review of the research on youth smoking, reported in the International Journal of Advertising (1993), concludes, "There is no evidence in any of the studies to suggest that, if cigarette were banned, it would make the least difference in the propensity of children to smoke."

An analysis of annual tobacco consumption in 22 countries assessing the likely effect of a cigarette advertising ban on interpretation makes that a ban may have the opposite desired effect – it may increase public curiosity. The studies suggest in the International Journal of Advertising (1993) a plausible counterargument indicates that without cigarette advertising, health warning labels have reduced exposure.

A 1992 study by Dr. Richard Mizikif (Florida State University) presented at the American Medical Association’s conference on smoking and health, concluded that there is no significant correlation between cigarette advertising and the initiation of smoking among adolescents.

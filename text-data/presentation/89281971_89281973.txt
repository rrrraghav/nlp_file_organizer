Statement of Terrie Dort, Executive Director

Introduction by Congressman Waxman

The National Council of Chain Restaurants applauds Congressman Henry Waxman for introducing
the Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993. We are proud to endorse this legislation as a fair and
comprehensive resolution to the issue of smoking in places of public accommodation.

The National Council of Chain Restaurants represents most of America’s multi-state, multi-unit
restaurant and foodservice chains. We employ almost 2 million people in more than 90,000
restaurants nationwide. McDonald's, Burger King Wendy's, Taco Bell and all our members appreciate
Congressman Waxman’s smoke-free initiative because it treats all businesses equally under the law -
the only legislation to do so.

The National Council of Chain Restaurants is traditionally not a big fan of federal mandates.

However, our industry recognizes the ever growing public demand for smokers to refrain from
smoking while they are in a public facility. The Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993 is the only way
to resolve this issue fairly. This bill makes no distinctions between different types of public facilities,
and no one group or industry is singled out and treated differently.

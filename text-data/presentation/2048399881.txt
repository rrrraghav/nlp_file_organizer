Cato environmental expert available to comment on secondhand smoke study

The Congressional Research Service has released a report, “Environmental Tobacco
Smoke and Lung Cancer Risk,” which misses serious questions about reports from EPA and
OSHA that have purported to find major risks from secondhand smoke.

The CRS study notes that the meta-analysis performed by EPA is "not statistically
significant at a conventional 95 percent level" and that if OSHA had performed a mem-
analysis it would probably have found “no increased lung cancer risk from occupational
[environmental tobacco smoke] exposure.”

Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute, has studied the
environmental tobacco smoke issue and is available to discuss the CRS report. His January
1995 Wall Street Journal op-ed on cancer risks accompanies this fax.

DUPLICATE

Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. I’m Steve Parrish, Senior Vice
President of Phillip Morris U.S.A. We've asked you here this morning to
discuss the risk assessment on Environmental Tobacco Smoke that we
understand will be finally, officially released by EPA on



(DATE) _______________




We have not seen the final report, but we expect it to be little changed
from the previous draft, and I think everyone in this room is aware of
what the conclusion will be.

Frankly, I expect no one here to believe one word we say. In fact, my
only hope is that you apply perhaps 10% of the skepticism you reserve
for my company, my industry and me to the EPA. If you go just that far
-- if your skepticism could take you just a few steps beyond reporting
this as an “EPA reported and the tobacco industry said” story -- then I
am confident you will conclude that what the EPA wants you to see is not
nearly what the science supports.

What the EPA wants you to see is a risk assessment that no one but
tobacco interests will challenge, because it’s about tobacco, and it seems
that virtually everyone is willing to believe virtually anything negative
about tobacco without scrutiny.

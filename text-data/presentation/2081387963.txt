PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. STATEMENT ON SPENDING SETTLEMENT FUNDS
TO SUPPORT YOUTH SMOKING PREVENTION PROGRAMS

The issue of youth smoking – a very serious and complex problem – has been the subject
of intensive public debate over the last several years. This discussion has heightened
since the major U.S. tobacco companies agreed to a comprehensive settlement with the
states last November. The settlement provides the states approximately $200 billion in
new funding over the next 25 years and the states must now decide how to spend this
money.

Philip Morris believes the settlement provides the states an unprecedented opportunity to
design and implement programs that can reduce youth smoking. We hope that the states
will devote a portion of their settlement funds to pay for a comprehensive state program
to reduce use of, and access to, tobacco products by minors.

This kind of comprehensive effort would include advertising campaigns, education in
schools, community-based programs that promote positive youth development, and
enhanced access prevention and enforcement efforts.

In 1998, Philip Morris U.S.A. created a Youth Smoking Prevention department whose
goal is to develop and support programs to help reduce the incidence of youth smoking.
We are devoting more than $100 million this year alone to a substantive and long-term
effort that will combine Communication, Education, Community Action and Access
Prevention initiatives. Philip Morris U.S.A. is committed to taking responsible action on
this issue, just as we are sincerely committed to full compliance to both the spirit and the
letter of the Master Settlement Agreement with the states. To that end, we are willing to
work with all those who are responsibly committed to achieving a measurable reduction
in youth smoking.

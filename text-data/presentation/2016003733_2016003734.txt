FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 30, 1970

A cigarette industry spokesman said today “Ralph Nader has
allowed himself to become a party to the familiar hit-and-run
tactics of the anti-cigarette lobby.”

Horace Kornegay, President of The Tobacco Institute, said
in behalf of the Institute’s members that Nader’s allegations
regarding certain non-tobacco additives in their cigarettes are
“specifically and categorically false.”

Nader made his charges and called for a government investigation
in a letter written last Sunday to Miles W. Kirkpatrick, Chairman
of the Federal Trade Commission, and distributed to newsmen the
same day. Kornegay’s response was in a letter to Kirkpatrick today.

Kornegay charged that neither Nader nor his associates, including
the American Cancer Society, had asked manufacturers whether
they add to their cigarettes such materials as asbestos, inorganic
silicous compounds, glass fibers, rock wool or diatomaceous earth,
as suggested by Nader.

Mr. Nader could have learned the facts in a “single day” from
the industry, "in lieu of his devious and circuitous pursuit.”
Kornegay said.

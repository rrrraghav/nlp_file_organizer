STATEMENT

John P. Wyatt, M.D.

I am John P. Wyatt, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pathology, University of Manitoba. My remarks concern the difficulties involved in determining the causal backgrounds of the chronic respiratory diseases -- particularly bronchitis and emphysema. In my opinion, there is no basis for attributing a major causal role in these conditions to cigarette smoking.

My own investigations beginning with observations of the effects of distinctive lung pollutants, such as in silicosis and the soft coal workers' lung of Southern Illinois coal fields and in the more ambivalent fields of naturally occurring emphysema, has progressively strengthened my belief that the condition called emphysema is the result of multiple and as yet undetermined causes.

In my original investigation into centrilobular emphysema published in 1960, I stressed that the nature of the pigmented material found in the lung was likely a reflection of industrial air pollution and possibly also of the dirty air of St. Louis in the 1930's. A few years later we demonstrated by chemical analysis that a damaged lung could continue to entrap agents currently in the air. Interestingly, we found evidence in such lungs of Strontium 90, which was demonstrated to be fallout from atomic bomb testing in 1960. We did not find in these lungs any evidence of components of cigarette smoke.

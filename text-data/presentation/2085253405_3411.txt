FDA REGULATION, PHILIP MORRIS USA AND YOU
SLIDE 1

Why Do We Want Regulation?

Philip Morris USA has decided to pursue real, reasonable and responsible FDA regulation of tobacco products. Philip Morris USA decided on this course of action because it will be good for our business in several respects. These can be summed up in three words: stability, certainty, and uniformity. Every businessman in the country seeks a business environment that provides those three things.

We seek greater Stability in our business and with the federal government.
• We believe that tough but reasonable FDA regulation will be good for our tobacco business. It will provide the stability and predictability that comes with knowing what the rules are and how to follow them. It can provide the opportunity to define, through statute and regulation, the rules of the game for making and marketing cigarettes in the United States.
• In the absence of regulation, our critics will continue defining us as a "rogue, unregulated, and out of control industry.”
• Greater stability with the federal government can and should establish equilibrium with policymakers that will allow us to conduct our business in a less “politically volatile” environment.

FDA regulation can also provide greater Certainty so that we can achieve our business goals.
• Philip Morris USA believes that reasonable FDA regulation of tobacco products could effectively address many of the complex issues that concern the public, the public health community and us.
• These issues include youth smoking prevention; ingredient and constituent testing and disclosure; and standards for defining, and for the responsible marketing of any, reduced risk products.
• It will help ensure that the same rules apply to all cigarettes sold in the U.S.

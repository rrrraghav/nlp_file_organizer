AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY TV ADS
SUPPORT FDA REGULATION OF TOBACCO



WASHINGTON (October 26, 1995) -- The American Cancer Society is urging public support of the proposal to protect children from tobacco through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through a new series of TV ads on CNN.




These ads will begin airing on Thursday, October 26 during "Larry King Live" to help educate the public about the issues surrounding adolescent tobacco use.



The first advertisement, “Younger and Younger” illustrates how the tobacco industry has used advertising and promotional materials that appeal to children to lure children to their products. Additional ads may be placed over the next months. The ad depicts the alarmingly young ages at which children begin to smoke.




The ads were created to reiterate the importance of the approval of the proposed FDA regulations to protect children from tobacco which were outlined by President Clinton in his August 10 press conference. A comment period ending on January 2, 1996 is established to allow the American people and concerned organizations the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations. The American Cancer Society fully supports the regulations outlined by the President and is asking that the public voice its approval as well.




"The facts are simple: nicotine is an addictive drug," said Dr. Blake Cady of the American Cancer Society Board of Directors. "Most smokers start smoking before they’re 18; a fact that the tobacco industry has known for years. That's why smoking has been called a pediatric disease. And it’s also why the tobacco industry targets kids – if they can get our children hooked on nicotine, they won’t have adult customers."




The American Cancer Society believes that children must be protected from tobacco and that the proposed FDA regulations address many of the key issues associated with adolescent tobacco use. Concerned citizens can express their support of the proposal by sending letters to the FDA before January 2, 1996 at:

GOVERNMENT TO BAN TOBACCO ADVERTISING

OTTAWA - Health and Welfare Minister Jake Epp today announced his intention to introduce legislation banning tobacco advertising and—
promotion in Canada and strengthened his commitment to the National Program to Reduce Tobacco Use.

The Tobacco Products Control Act would ban, under threat of significant penalties, all forms of advertising and promotion of tobacco products available in Canada. This includes the use of
tobacco-product trade marks or brand names in association with sponsorship activities, as well as related promotional practices involving contests and coupons, product sampling and non-tobacco goods.

Other provisions in the Act would ensure that strongly worded, prominent and rotating health warnings are included on packaging for tobacco products, that toxic substances in tobacco
are reported to federal authorities and listed prominently on packaging, and that manufacturers and importers report production, importation and sales figures for their products.

STATEMENT OF
Brennan Moran

Assistant to the President
The Tobacco Institute

I am pleased to be here today to release the first detailed study of actual
indoor air quality conditions in Dallas offices and restaurants. This report
provides us with the first understanding of the average level of environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) nonsmokers might be exposed to in Dallas offices and
restaurants.

These findings should be of vital interest to the public and government
officials who, until now, have not had the benefit of actual, scientific tests in
their consideration of the appropriateness of smoking restrictions. Yet,
ironically, many restrictions have been adopted on the basis of supposition
rather than solid data.

The study clearly shows that ETS should not be an environmental concern
to persons who work and eat in Dallas. These findings underscore the critical
importance of scientific measurements. If laws affecting the environment are
going to be based on science -- as we believe they should be -- then those
making the regulations have an obligation to get an accurate assessment of
existing “real world” conditions. And we have the obligation to provide it.

It should now be evident that there is no cause for concern on the part
nonsmokers.

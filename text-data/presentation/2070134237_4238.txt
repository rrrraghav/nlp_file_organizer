AMENDMENT GIVES FDA THE GREEN LIGHT
FOR TOBACCO REGULATION, HEALTH GROUPS SAY

Washington, June 13—Congress has moved one step closer to changing the course of tobacco
control history. An amendment to the House Agriculture Appropriations bill introduced today by
Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) and Rep. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), would clarify the federal Food and
Drug Administration’s authority to regulate tobacco products under the agency's existing drug laws.
The American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the American Cancer
Society, united as the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, applauded today’s action and urge Congress
to lend its full support to the amendment.

“FDA Commissioner Kessier has asked Congress for ‘guidance’ on tobacco regulation. Today
Mr. Synar and Mr. Durbin have decided to take him up on his request,” said Scott D. Ballin,
chairman of the steering committee for the coalition and vice president, public affairs for the AHA.
Added Ballin, “There has been a decades-long wrestling match, with Big Tobacco in one corner
and the public health community in the other. If Congress has the courage to push this amendment
through, Dr. Kessier will have the tobacco industry pinned.”

A Gallup survey conducted for the health groups in 1993 found that 68 percent of Americans
believe that the FDA should regulate tobacco products in a manner similar to the way drugs are
regulated. The survey also found that a majority of Americans favor restrictions on cigarette
advertising that appeals to children, that encourages people to smoke or that make smoking appear
glamorous.

The amendment is consistent with legislation, “The Fairness in Tobacco and Nicotine
Regulation Act of 1993” (H.R. 2147), introduced earlier by Synar and Durbin. It clearly outlines
the FDA’s authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, labeling, advertising and
promotion and content of tobacco products. It specifically says that the regulations may not ban all
tobacco products. The amendment also gives the FDA specific enforcement powers to act against
any tobacco manufacturer found to be in violation of FDA regulations.

“This is a sensible, straightforward approach to tobacco control, supported by both smokers and
non-smokers,” said Ballin.

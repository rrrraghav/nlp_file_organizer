INTRODUCTION

"We appreciate very much this opportunity to appear
before you today to discuss the tobacco/health controversy.

While the tobacco/health issue is obviously an all-
important one to us, we realize that it is only one of many
others with which you are concerned. We are not here today to
quote prove endquote that cigarettes do not cause lung cancer
or that cigarettes are quote good endquote for you.

Our purpose in seeking this audience is simply to
expose information to you of which you may not be aware and
that we believe has a significant bearing on the controversy.

The facts and statements which we will give you today
are presented by us in the belief that there are many controver-
sial questions concerning smoking and health and that these ques-
tions must ultimately be answered by further scientific research
and new knowledge--and that full, free, and informed public dis-
cussion is essential in the public interest.

This field as you know is a complex one and one in which
a vast amount of scientific research has been performed. Although
there are many other sources of information which we could have
used and which we can supply, in selecting the material for our
presentation today we have confined ourselves to those sources

TOBACCO INDUSTRY WINS
UNION HEALTH FUND CASE

AKRON (Mar. 18) - A jury ruled today that the major U.S. tobacco manufacturers are not responsible for any alleged smoking-related medical costs paid by Ohio’s labor union health care funds for their workers.

"This jury has sent a clear message reaffirming that health risks of smoking have been well known for decades and that cigarette companies have not withheld material information regarding those health effects from the public, including union health trust funds."

“The verdict also is an acknowledgment that the major tobacco companies have worked to develop less risky cigarettes and rejects the theory that there was any kind of conspiracy to avoid certain types of smoking and health research,” said Robert C. Weber, lead attorney for the tobacco companies.

The unanimous verdict by the 11-member jury in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, along with the decisions of 10 federal court judges who earlier rejected without trial – similar cases in other states brought by union health funds, lends further support to the industry’s view that the lawsuits are without merit.

“Most federal courts have thrown these cases out before trial on purely legal grounds. Now an Ohio jury, having seen and heard the best evidence plaintiffs' lawyers can offer, concluded these cases have no merit,” said Weber.

The class-action suit, brought on behalf of more than 100 union funds, alleged tobacco companies improperly shifted smoking-related health care costs to the funds by concealing facts about the negative health effects related to smoking, and also suppressed the development of a ‘safer’ cigarette.

FCC IS ATTEMPTING TO REGULATE ADVERTISING
THROUGH ITS FAIRNESS DOCTRINE, STONE SAYS

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 9. — Charles M. Stone, vice president for radio of
the National Association of Broadcasters, said today the Federal Communications
Commission’s application of its Fairness Doctrine to cigarette advertising
is an attempt “to regulate advertising in a manner contrary to the wishes of
Congress and existing laws.”

If the Commission is consistent in its interpretation of the Doctrine,
he said, there is no limit to the number of products advertised on radio and
television which would require the presentation of contrasting views.

He also warned that while broadcasters are fighting the FCC’s action
in court, other advertising media “face the potential imposition of like
restrictions by Congress or one of its regulatory arms.”

Addressing a dinner meeting of the 16th Annual North Carolina Farm
Press, Radio and Television Institute here, Mr. Stone said that if the FCC
persists in following its decision, "it is entering a bureaucratic
labyrinth from which no one, including it, will ever likely find an exit
again."

He said “this is an area in which the Commission has no expertise and
no legitimate standing.”

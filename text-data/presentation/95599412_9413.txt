R.J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO. RESPONDS TO NEWS COVERAGE OF MARCH 13, 1996

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- We remain confident we will prevail in all pending tobacco
litigation. We remain equally confident that the Food and Drug Administration does not have
jurisdiction over tobacco. We have no intention of settling any of these claims. Although we do
not have all the facts yet and have not reviewed LeBow’s proposed settlement with plaintiffs'
attorneys, we suspect it’s an irresponsible and reckless ploy to influence RJR Nabisco
shareholders in the proxy contest.

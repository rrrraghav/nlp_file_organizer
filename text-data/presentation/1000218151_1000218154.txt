Metabolism and Nitrosation of Nicotine

E. Boyland

Nicotine is metabolised to several products but the author proposes to deal only with cotinine, the hypothetial hydroxy nicotine and the oxides of nicotine.

Cotinine is an important metabolite of nicotine. Truhaut, de Clercq and Loisillier (1964) showed that cotinine was 50 times less toxic than nicotine on injection in mice. When administered to 60 rats in the drinking water 12 out of 15 that died between the 8th and 18th months had various malignant tumours but none of the 45 rats which were killed after 18 months had malignant tumours.

Schmühl and Osswald (1968) treated 60 rats with cotinine so that they received doses of about 20g. per Kg. body weight. One rat developed a hepatoma but the incidence of fibromas and thymomas was the same as in the control animals.

When treated in adult mice by subcutaneous injection or skin painting cotinine did not induce any tumours. On injection into newborn mice or implantation into the bladders of adult mice it induced some tumours (Boyland, 1968 unpublished observations). The evidence that cotinine is carcinogenic is not conclusive but as cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine it should investigated further in long term tests. Cotinine is formed from nicotine by the lung tissue of rats and also by adult and foetal human lung.

Hydroxynicotine

When rats are pretreated with nicotine they became resistant to the lethal action of nicotine. This could be due to a nicotine metabolite protecting the animals from the effects of nicotine itself. Cotinine does not have the protective effect but a product prepared by reduction of cotinine with lithium aluminium hydride does protect against nicotine. The product, which could be hydroxynicotine, could not be obtained in a pure state. The experiments indicate that this

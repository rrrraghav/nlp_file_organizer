Abstract: A method is described using specialized techniques for the collection, sample preparation, and analysis of mainstream tobacco smoke condensate (TSC) for the determination of trace level iron, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, nickel, arsenic, and lead. Mainstream cigarette smoke was collected with a modified linear smoking machine that included specially designed vapor electrodes was replacement of metal parts in the cigarette smoking machine with polypropylene parts. All collections were performed in a vertical laminar flow hood using FTC specifications: 35 ml puff volume, 60 second puff frequency, 2s puff duration. Sample preparation procedures were performed in a clean environment. A portion of the smoke condensate was quantitatively removed from the quartz tip tube, transferred to a 100 ml volumetric flask, and prepared using methanol, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid. The trace elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAA). The results of TR-4F TSC analyses for these trace level elements are compared with literature values of similar cigarette types.

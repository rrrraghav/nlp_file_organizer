SUBJECT: MAVERICK SPECIALS – PROGRESS REPORT

EFFECTIVENESS OF: Pre-Sell - Harley Transition Booklet/Coupon – Maverick/Harley B1G1F
(Report on May 27 only)

PRE-SELL: Sales force encountered little if any difficulty selling Maverick to retail and wholesale accounts.
Coverage during presell period was diminished due to affixing booklets, assembling B1G1F’s and leveling inventories.

HARLEY TRANSITION BOOKLET/COUPON: Retailers report receiving many trifold $.50 coupons.
Booklet size was too large for King Size Box packings and covers tear tape, resulting in difficulty in opening pack. Booklets design did a great job conveying transition message.

MAVERICK/HARLEY B1G1F: Excellent in selling retail inventories while giving the consumer a first hand
chance to try and compare Maverick to Harley. In most cases, deals sold through at accelerated rates.

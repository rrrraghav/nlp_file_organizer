Re: List of selected URSUS smoking machine parts from German suppliers

Dear Neal:

Please find attached the list of selected smoking machine parts from German suppliers which we suggest. We have already started to order most of these. Currently, delivery of all these parts was promised by the first week of November. This would fit with your schedule to have them at your site by the middle of November. Please contact me if you need additional parts or if there are any questions with regard to the list.

Kind regards
Falk

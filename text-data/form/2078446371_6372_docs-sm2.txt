Scientific Area: ETS EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT - Computational Fluid Dynamics

Project Name: Comparison of Three Air Distribution Systems by Computational Fluid Dynamic Modeling

Objective: To prepare and submit a publication manuscript that compares the removal effectiveness of three different air distribution systems in a model hospitality venue by CFD modeling by July 2000.

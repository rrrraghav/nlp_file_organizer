Study Plan Amendment: P - /3370 Change-No.: 1  Major Change 2
yes  no

Short Title: TK, Parameter 3

Study Director: HSR

Author of Change: HSR Date Submitted: 11.Aug.2000

Subject: Concentration ranges to be assayed for the second MSC batch of the research cigarettes in the absence of S9 (see Table 3 in the Study Plan).

Reason(s) for Change: The results of the cytotoxicity determination (Relative Survival) for the first MSC batch of the research cigarettes assayed in the absence of S9 (exposition date 31.Jul.2000) showed that the lowest tested MSC concentration for all cigarette types resulted in relative survival levels between 100 and 120 %, where no increases in the mutant frequency over the background mutant frequency are generally expected. In order to get a more precise determination of the mutant frequency, also the highest tested MSC concentrations of cigarettes 268 and 269 will be slightly changed to obtain a lower cytotoxicity.

Change: The concentration ranges to be assayed for the second MSC batch of all cigarette types in the absence of S9 will be changed (see attached Table).

Consequences of Change and Measures to be Taken: Inform team IT/MC, Table “Treat” has to be changed

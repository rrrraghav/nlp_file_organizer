SUBJECT: AMERICAN VIEWPOINT OSHA SURVEY

You have recently received a fax copy of the preliminary results of American
Viewpoint’s OSHA survey. We intend to schedule a full briefing with Linda and
discuss it with anyone not mentioned on the accompanying American Viewpoint
memorandum. If you already have made copies of the survey, please retrieve them.
After the presentation we can discuss whether and in what way to use this information.

I will be contacting you next week to schedule a time for American Viewpoint’s
presentation. Meanwhile, if you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 212-
880-3467.

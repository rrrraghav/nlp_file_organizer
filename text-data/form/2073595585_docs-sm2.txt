Jay:

I’ve faxed: A copy of the Philip Morris 2-pg spread that addresses trade class shifts. Note that this ad is targeted to supermarket operates even though it shows a store shares. Since this report is running simultaneously in four trade publications, you will want to modify the copy if you choose to run this ad.

Also, there are four sample letters to “valued customers” which have run in trade magazines - Kraft, McCormick, JTL and US Tobacco. Hope this is helpful.
Larry Schaeffer.

Special Instructions: Here is the Puerto Rico D&T. I have also included the draft response that I believe must be updated to include at least INBIFO if not others and maybe some of the new information we discussed. As we discussed, I am preparing a list of cases with D&Ts so we can supplement, if necessary, in each when we file the PR response.

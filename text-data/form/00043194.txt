COMMENT
The dog was on the PMO study in Enviro Control and was a high nicotine smoker. He
had smoked 399 cigarettes in a period of 34 days. The findings in the case were those
of thrombi in both auricular appendages of the heart with multiple emboli in six of
the seven lobes. As a result of these emboli, recent infarcts developed within the lung.
As is common in the presence of infarction, bronchopneumonia is a complication.
It has been our experience that dogs who smoke a high nicotine cigarette develop
pulmonary infarction. The origin of the emboli is in the thrombi within the auricular
appendages. Thrombosis in the heart occurs infrequently in low nicotine cigarette
smoking dogs. It is interesting that this dog as well as Dog 6025 and other PMO
smokers show similar changes. The presence of the pneumonia is a complication of
the pulmonary infarction.

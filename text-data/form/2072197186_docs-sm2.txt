RE: Junk Science Column, D. Post...
# of Pgs: 2

We’ve got the ball rolling out here on the junk science issue. Pls. refer to the attached column written by editorial writer & columnist Al Knight of the Denver Post, attacking the EPA's methodology and science with their new Clean Air Standards.

One of Al’s growing pet peeves is the assumption by some governmental agencies of new powers to establish guidelines over previously exempt industries, products and domains, without regard to need or cost-benefit analyses.

We believe it may be a cost-sharp step for AI to delve into junk science as an ongoing topic for his thrice-weekly column, since there are several local situations that can be bolstered with broader, national information. We are assembling materials to assist him in criticizing the wrongheadedness of the EPA, FDA, OSHA and other bureaucracies that are apparently expanding their empires via rules and regulations they may not actually have the authority to implement.

Give us a call if you have any questions.

Dear Ms. Crumpton:

Thank you for your interest in our youth non-smoking materials. The table cards and booklets you ordered are enclosed. The posters are being sent separately.

The posters can be placed in classrooms, on school bulletin boards, and in other locations where the students will see them.

The table cards can be placed on teachers’ and counselors’ desks, or cafeteria tables, etc.

The two booklets are designed to be used by parents and other adults when talking to kids about peer pressure and peer influence. They are for use by counselors and interested teachers. You might also want to give a few copies to your parent group leader. We can provide additional copies to the parent group if there is interest.

The quantity of booklets you requested, however, has been reduced, as they were developed for use by adults rather than for distribution to students.

Thank you again for your interest. We hope these materials will be helpful in your efforts to persuade young people not to smoke.

Sincerely,



Herbert E. Osmon

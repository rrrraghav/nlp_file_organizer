Dear Mister Rustemeier,
I have a few questions about 1R4F and 1RSF.
I would like to know if you still have these references cigarettes at Inbifo, if yes, how many ? Would you agree to send
us cigarettes in case we might need some?
Do you have the university’s address (E-Mail or fax) which manufactures these cigarettes ?
Thank you very much for your precious help.

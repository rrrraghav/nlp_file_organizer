PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Replace the existing headbox and inlet manifold on Line I and Line II.

PROJECT JUSTIFICATION:
Current operating plans are for Line II to operate at 450 feet per minute in 1996. This will require replacement of the existing headbox, which is 19 years old. The headbox is constructed of carbon steel with stainless steel liner. The carbon steel is resting resulting in warping of the headbox bottom. This warping is causing sheet streaks and basis weight variations and therefore variations of RL sheet. The Line II headbox will be moved to Line I.

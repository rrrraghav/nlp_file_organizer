Re.:  New revised method for 2-nitropropane



Dear Gerry:





Please find attached our new SOP for the determination of 2-nitropropane in mainstream smoke. The method was validated according to our method validation SOP. It was already applied to mainstream smoke from 1RF, 1R5F, and VIRGO in the "Profile" study (0500/3307) and to mainstream smoke from 1RF4 and test cigarettes in the study “Tomorrow” (0500/3321).





Sincerely



Willum

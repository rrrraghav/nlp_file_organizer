INVENTION RECORD

Preliminary Disclosure for Consideration of Patentability

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION (in sufficient detail for the invention to be understood; please identify or attach copies of any reports, notebook pages, or other documents containing particular examples or other pertinent data): “Paper-plug” type filters with carbon molecules have been based compositions in the "face" of the filter, for flavor content of the cigarette.

Recently (S. Maroldo, talking thru private communication), carbon molecular sieve with a relatively wide range of polarities and mean micropores sizes were made available. An optimum match between polarity mix pore size of the adsorbent, and polarity and molecule size of the flavourant, will permit this composition (flavourant adsorbed on adsorbent) to work in a flavor release system. The impregnation is applied in the “face” of the filter, and during smoking, the volatile vapors (small and very polar molecules) will release the flavourant form inside the pore of the adsorbent into the mainstream of the cigarette.
The principle can be extended to a "non-combustion" smokey article.

2. OBJECTS/ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION: Object: to implement the mainstream of the “cigarette” with a chosen volatile flavourant (like for example, phenyl ethyl alcohol or linalool), so to deliver a flavourant to a non air stream (“non combustion type cigarette”).
Advantage: to obtain external action (heat or mechanically electrical) is necessary, list any known brands only that seem/definition only.

3. STATE OF THE ART (list and title for publications of adsorption/desorption):
The “inhale” of the flavourant, will be direct and concentrated.
Information access Adsorbent, which shall be used as adsorbent material, is available in the market.

4. HAS THERE BEEN DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION TO ANYONE OUTSIDE THE COMPANY? NO. X YES ( )

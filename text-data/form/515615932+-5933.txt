Dear Roger,

I have enjoyed my first year as a new member of the State Assembly and I am excited to be part of our Republican leadership team.

In the past, legislators have been able to contact lobbyists directly to seek funds for their campaign committees. However, the passage of Proposition 208 in 1996 banned such contact with lobbyists and created much confusion among legislators, PAC directors and others involved in the financing of political campaigns.

I believe the enclosed card will help to answer many of the most commonly asked questions, in language that can be understood by everyone. The answers come directly from the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) and represent the most up-to-date information available.

The FPPC has informed me that I am able to raise funds from PACs and corporations during the current blackout period. The maximum you can give is $500 which represents 1996 Primary Election debt and $250 for my 1996 General Election debt. I would greatly appreciate a contribution from you at this time to help me clear up these debts.

I will continue to keep you informed on the latest rulings and decisions that impact California politics. Feel free to call me anytime should you have any questions or concerns about other issues facing our state.

Sincerely,

Genge Runner
George Runner
Assemblymember Thirty-Sixth District

P.S. Again, you can give up to $500 to my campaign fund. Thank you for your continued support, it is greatly appreciated.

BASIC JOB PROCEDURE

Job Steps

1. Notify all affected employees that the lockout/
   tagout will be performed.

2. Shut down equipment by normal stopping pro-
   cedure and ensure equipment has come to a
   complete stop.

3. Lock out/tag out the following potentially
   hazardous energy sources per Park 500 Lockout
   Policy. See attachment for energy isolation
   locations.

a. Electrical - Disconnects shall be in the
   "OFF" position, locked and tagged with a
   Philip Morris-supplied locking device.
   This provides a positive means to physical-
   ly isolate energy from the equipment.
   Always stand to the side and look away
   from a switch box when activating on/
   off switch. This will minimize potential
   exposure should an electrical arc occur.

a. Death or serious injury could
   result from disconnecting or
   exploding while equipment is
   under load/running. Electrical
   shock & burn could result
   from frayed, exposed or im-
   properly grounded wiring or
   unauthorized tampering with
   energized electrical circuits.

Project Description: Marlboro Fulfillment – Order Entry Processing Q4 1999, C ‘2000

Financial Elements:

Fees: $ 8.000.000

Total: $ 10.000.000

Accounting/Project Code: 3-15-3501-10-15a2

Compliance with Competitive Bidding Policy: (See Also Attached Bid Waiver)
(was the project competitively bid and if it does not document the exception)

Image Entry has performed mail opening and data entry procedures for PM since Q4 1998, and in 1999 PM and Image Entry developed a new order processing system that will meet MSA order processing rules set forth in Marlboro promotions. Management agreed to not bid on the fulfillment business. Reasons included the extensive efforts required for data migration, the ongoing changes required by the MSA, and the need to support the timing and level of promotional activities. Issuance of an RFI in 2000 and re-evaluating migration and /or consolidation was also agreed to for the calendar year 2001.

Image Entry’s pricing reflects the processing changes required to meet MSA obligations. Processing under MSA guidelines reduces overall productivity by approximately 50%. This has resulted in unfavorable pricing variances in most areas. The proposal reflects an aggregate increase of $1.7mm dollars (20.7%) for the year 2000.

Proposed costs from Image Entry are comparable or less than both current and proposed 2000 pricing of the OPB & D vendor performing similar services.

Celeste,

Good to see you on Thursday. When I send these
reports, I only fax to you. Would you mind making sure
Joan and Chris get copies of these. Chris was unaware
that we were over 1,000 when I talked to her on Thursday
(she thought we had 15 calls). So let them both know
things are going great. Over 3,000!

Also, continue to track those that are returned. If you can’t
find them in records to show they were incomplete
requests. Thanks Celeste.

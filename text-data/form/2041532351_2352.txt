Marketing Brief:
Authorization to proceed with project prior to obtaining written approvals? [CC]
Yes O No

As per our meeting on Wednesday, April 13th with Carl Cohen and Mark Waichuk, and our subsequent telephone conversations with Mark on April 14th, we have been requested to continue
with a design for the Brand X project as follows:

- As a result of preliminary research testing of selected designs for this project, we are to prepare
the following additional design revisions.
As testers/consumers did not like the white background shown on the test designs as they were
viewed as being generic, especially in combination with a red, white and blue color scheme.
- The designs showing the kraft background was viewed as being more like a cigar product too
strong, heavy looking.
- The use of a script for the logo was also viewed as being somewhat confusing, that “Phill” (Mel,
Jake, or Dave) would necessarily write it over their names this way, etc., that a simple typeface or
printed name would be more appropriate.
- Also due the use of gold on the design, especially if a lot of gold is used was not in keeping with Phill’s.
The all red background pack design wasn't appropriate for Phill’s. It was too much like Rev. P1250

Based upon the above information, Car! would like for us to take our original Phill’s design, alter
(P-1250) and prepare additional pack designs using a color palette which is more true to Phill's.
We want the Phill’s symbol and lighten the overall color scheme to make it look less like a cigar product.
Please also explore the use of a simpler typeface for the logo, and consider eliminating or reducing
the amount of gold used on the design. We will need to present these revised designs at a meeting
on April 21st.

Re: Hecht and Hoffmann letter draft

Dear Richard,

Following some suggestion from Hans-Jurgen Hausmann, HER and others, I have made a few minor corrections to the attached draft. However, I have also had to make a major change in the dose/exposure calculation for NNK. Having identified the study cited by H&H to be Belinsky et al (1980), the corrected PY estimate now reads 720 PY instead of the 1,860 PY previously stated. All corrections are underlined.

Best regards,

Tory

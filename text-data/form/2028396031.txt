YOUR CORRESPONDENT.

Dear Sorell,

Your secretary phoned and told me about some difficulties in
receiving our fax. This is why I am sending the list of names
and addresses again. However, upon reflection I am adding two
more names : Francis Roe and Thorbjörn Malmfors.

The complete list is therefore : Roe, Malmfors, Hackenberg,
Adikofer, Lister, Sherlock, Schneider, Altmann, Thornton, Cericoli
and Werkö. VOSS, PARRISH

The theme of the “workshop” could perhaps be described as "risk
assessment in low dose situations". The purpose should be to
take stock of the state of today’s knowledge”. We have suggested
such a wide span of disciplines in order to truly cover all
aspects of the problem.

Kind regards,

STUDY Biological Test for Plastics Class VI (4
Extracts) Temp/Time 121°C for 1 hour



REFERENCE: USP 23, NF16, 1995, pp. 1699-1702, 1895.

GENERAL PROCEDURE: The test article extracts and corresponding blanks (control extracts) were injected
systemically and intra-articularily in mice and rabbits, respectively. The injections were in the amounts
and routes set forth by USP 23, including the number of animals used for each route. The extracts and PEG
were observed for signs of toxicity and clinical reactivity for up to 72 hours post treatment. In
addition, the test article was implanted into the paravertebral muscle of rabbits for 7 days and observed
for signs of hemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis, discoloration, and encapsulation.

RESULTS: None of the mice injected with the test article extracts exhibited any signs of toxicity in the
systemic injection tests. In addition, none of the rabbits injected intra-articularily with the test article
extracts exhibited any signs of systemic or local clinical toxicity. In both the Systemic and
Intra-articular Tests the controls were normal through 72 hours. There were no gross findings or
significant signs of hemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis, dissolution, or encapsulation compared with
those of control sites.

CONCLUSION: The test article meets the requirements of USP 23, NF16, 1995, for
the Biological Test for Plastics Class VI-212°C.

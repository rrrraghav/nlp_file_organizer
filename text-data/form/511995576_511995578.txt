Dear Ms. Sexton:

Thank you for your recent request for pocket ashtrays. Our pocket ashtray program is an important part of Reynolds Tobacco’s environmental program and we appreciate your interest and support.

Within the next few weeks, you will receive the following materials:

8,000 - Vantage Pocket Ashtrays
1,000 - Golf Bumperstickers
25 - Beach Bumperstickers
25 - Golf Tentcards

As a reminder, these materials should be give to smokers 21 years of age and older only.

As I’m sure you are aware, cigarettes are a target of anti-litter campaigns. Smokers who don’t take the time to properly dispose of their cigarette litter only compound the problem. Cigarette litter – filters, packaging and carton materials – are not haphazardly discarded waste containers and

The pocket ashtray offers one solution to the litter problem. First introduced in Japan, the pocket ashtray has promoted courteous smoking in that country for almost 30 years.

The reusable ashtray is made of plastic and the inside contains a fire-resistant material to prevent burning. While the package is designed to keep the cigarette, we recommend putting the cigarette out first, and then placing the butt in the pouch.

“We work for smokers.”

Abstract (Should not exceed one page nor 2000 characters for details to be included)
To date, 4251 human cases have had biopsy material submitted for a panel of 3 pathologists
who have in turn, classified the material. The results of the panel of 3 with respect to
first 2006 cases are published as a portion of the World Health Organization’s publication
on lung classification. A significant number of the total and were the most centrally
located, being obtained at transbronchial biopsy. Unidentified small cell carcinoma was
compared with squamous cell carcinoma. 63% of them were obtained by bronchial biopsy.
Approximately 20% of the total (4251) were obtained by bronchial biopsy.
The remaining 80% or approximately 3401 cases were obtained by other methods.
The majority of the bronchial biopsy specimens are from patients with a history of heavy smoking.
The poorly differentiated tumors were quite unreliably judged by lack
of uniformity.

Unanimity of the three pathologists was obtained in approximately 68% of the cases.
There were 241 cases where there was disagreement among the three pathologists.
These disagreements are being analyzed to determine if a more specific cost can be
developed for the classification of human cancer.

A panel of 3 pathologists was used to classify all cases. The results were obtained
by a blind comparison of the biopsy material with the clinical history and gross
pathology. The results are being compiled for publication in a book on human cancer.

A significant number of cases were obtained from patients with a history of heavy
smoking. The majority of the bronchial biopsy specimens are from patients with a
history of heavy smoking.

The results of this project will be used to develop a more specific cost for the
classification of human cancer.

Summary of Results:
The results of this project will be used to develop a more specific cost for the
classification of human cancer.

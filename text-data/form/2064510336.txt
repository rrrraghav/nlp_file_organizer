Abstract: Wetting experiments were carried out with filler metals such as pure silver, copper, gold, palladium and nickel on the surface of hot pressed MoSi2 specimens under vacuum. Wetting was observed for each of these combinations.
Metallographic examination revealed that chemical reaction also occurred for each combination. Both silver and gold reacted similarly with the MoSi2. For these two cases, metal droplets alloyed with silicon during the experiments, and this was reflected in these two cases. The source of silicon is these two cases was decomposition of MoSi2 between the liquid droplets. Molten nickel reacted with MoSi2, diffusing into the compound and forming nickel silicides.
Palladium also dissolved the MoSi2, but not as extensively as nickel. In the case of Pd/MoSi2 system, a number of palladium silicide reaction layers were formed.

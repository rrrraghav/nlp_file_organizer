Scientific Area: Product Evaluation

Project Name: Indirect Materials – direct contact hoses

Objective: Determine whether a hazard exists to the smoker from potential exposure to chemicals potentially extracted from direct-contact hoses used to move materials in the production facilities.

Project Leader: Kathy Fox

Tactics and Milestones: Target Date:

Review of historical records and literature to determine if chemicals are potentially 10/30/00-12/30/00
extracted in to the material transported during use of hoses.

Determine what factors may contribute to a materials ability to extract chemicals 11/30/00-1/30/01
from the hoses

Determine appropriate testing protocol for hoses being considered for use in facilities 12/30/01-3/30/01

Document findings and make recommendations for currently used hoses and hoses to 6/30/01
be reviewed for use.

Implement recommendations (if appropriate)

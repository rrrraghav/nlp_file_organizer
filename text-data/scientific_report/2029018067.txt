1 INTRODUCTION

In vitro cytotoxic effects of cigarette smoke on mammalian cells
have been investigated in various cell types. TABLE A gives some
examples of the cell types and the end points used in the litera-
ture.

The following techniques have been utilized for the exposure of
mammalian cells to cigarette smoke:

(1) passing of the cigarette smoke over the cell cultures in
liquid medium (Leuchtenberger, C. and Leuchtenberger, R.,
1969, e. g. INBiFO study P 0268/2121, 1985)

(2) direct contact between the cigarette smoke and the cells
without liquid interposition (Holt and Keast, 1973b, Voisin
et al., 1985)

(3) addition of aqueous extracts of the cigarette smoke to the
culture medium (Holt and Keast, 1973b, York et al., 1973,
Chamson et al., 1980, INBiFO study P 0500/3065, 1983)

The 4-day cytotoxicity assay is routinely used at INBiFO to
determine the cytotoxicity of whole smoke (MWS) and
mainstream gas/vapor phase (MGVP) of research cigarettes. The
assay was performed on the human lung PAN-L3 cell line. The PAN-L3
cell line was a courtesy of professor Cecile Leuchtenberger,
I.S.R.B.C., Lausanne, and has been used at INBiFO for cytotoxicity
studies with MWS (e. g. INBiFO study P 0268/2028, 1983), MGVP (e.
g. INBiFO study P 0268/2060, 1982), diluted MWS and sidestream
whole smoke (SWS) (e. g. INBiFO study P 0268/2133, 1986). When
inoculated into nude mice, it was shown that untreated PAN-L3
cells formed fibrosarcoma (INBiFO study P 0268/2028), which
indicates that the cells are transformed.

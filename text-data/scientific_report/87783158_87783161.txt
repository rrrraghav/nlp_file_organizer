Subject FINAL REPORT
Acute Dermal - Rabbits
Project No. 642-103

Date Received November 12, 1969.

Description Large clumps of white, crystalline material with an unpleasant odor.

Purity Assumed to be 100% active ingredient.

SUMMARY

The test material, a synthetic chemical, was evaluated for acute dermal
toxicity by a single, 24-hour dermal application to abraded and intact rabbit
skin at dosage levels of 1000, 2510, 6310, and 10,000 mg/kg of body weight. One
death occurred at the 10,000 mg/kg level; therefore, the acute dermal LD50 of the
test material is estimated to be greater than 10,000 mg/kg of body weight. Signs
of dermal irritation included slight erythema, slight desquamation, and slight
edema. Irritation was generally comparable in intact and abraded animals.

PROCEDURE

A single, 23-hour dermal application was made to the premoistened (tap
water) clipped intact (half the animals) and abraded (half the animals) abdominal
skin of four groups of four rabbits (New Zealand White) weighing from 2.1 to

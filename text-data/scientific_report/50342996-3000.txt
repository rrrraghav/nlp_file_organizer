CTR GRANT NO. 1987

Name of Investigator: Stephen B. Baylin, M.D. PERIOD COVERED: from 06/01/89 to 05/31/92

Title of Original Grant: Regulation of the DNA Methylase Gene In Normal vs. Cancer Cells

Abstract of the specific aims as stated in the original application:

The overall purpose of the present grant has been to characterize the human DNA-methyltransferase (DNA-MT) gene and learn more about its potential role in the evolution of human cancers. To this end the Specific Aims were:

Aim #1: To isolate and characterize genomic and cDNA clones for the human methylase gene.

Aim #2: To characterize the structure (including chromosomal location) of the human DNA methylase gene in normal and neoplastic cells.

Aim #3: To compare patterns of expression of the human DNA methylase gene in normal and neoplastic cells.

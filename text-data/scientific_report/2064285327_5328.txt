and the number of tested animals was too low for
further conclusions.
These tests could probably be improved by the application
of RIA-methods.

2.3.3. Histochemistry with induced lung cells
Fresh slides of lungs of smoke exposed rats (experi-
ment - /1282) were processed for the
histochemical detection of acid phosphatase and β-glu-
coronidase. Only lung macrophages showed positive reactions.
Reaction of pneumocytes II, if present, seemed negligible.
This principle could be used to measure an "activity
index" of free lung cells.

2.3.4. Enzyme pattern of free lung cells
The above mentioned histochemical finding implicates,
to complement free lung cell counts by semi-quantitative
determinations of protein pattern of leucocytes and
macrophages. These pattern can be obtained by isoelectric
focussing electrophoresis. Currently we develop methods
to separate macrophages and leucocytes out of lavage fluids.

2.3.5. Enzyme induction in various organs
This topic will be subject of the actual discussion.

1. RCB - CH

1.1. Status

On May 18, a Marlboro, in which current RCB-CH and RCB-US were
replaced by a sheet composed of 100% "in-house" generated
material (trial 31), was evaluated by panel A versus a current
Marlboro. A slight preference was given to the trial (1). The
analytical results of the two cigarettes were presented in the
last quarterly report.

After this evaluation, a decision was taken to produce RCB-CH
for several days with the same feedstock as in trial 31.

1.2. Trials

1.2.1. Objectives

To reproduce trial 31 (Lot 102) on a larger scale in a three
shift operation during 6 working days.
This trial started on June 13 and had the following
conditions :

Trial No. 35
40% Winnowed stems
60% Production dust
Reduced additive formula with dry flavours

The dry flavours had to be added manually per batch of slurry
preparation.

Trial No. 36
40% Winnowed stems
60% Production dust
Reduced additive formula without dry flavours

Several batches were produced using exactly the same
conditions as in trial 35 but without the addition of dry
flavours.

1.2.2. Comments

No processing problems were encountered during the production
of these trials.
The analytical work is in progress.

NINETY-DAY SUBCHRONIC TOXICITY STUDY
IN THE RAT WITH D-15

PATHOLOGY SUMMARY

INTRODUCTION

Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of tissues from 190

Sprague-Dawley rats were examined to determine the potential effect of
proctracted administration of D-15. The study design was as follows:

Group Number of Rats Dosage Level Test Article
1 (Control)* Males Females 0 mg/kg Vehicle (DH2O)
5 (Low) 20 20 1260 mg/kg D-15
6 (Mid) 20 20 2510 mg/kg D-15
7 (High) 20 20 5010 mg/kg D-15

*Shared common controls with companion studies testing D-14 and
D-20.

Following ninety days of treatment, all surviving rats were
sacrificed and complete necropsies were performed. All rats which died
or were sacrificed moribund were also necropsied. Sections of the
following tissues were examined from all rats in the control and high
dose groups: pituitary, heart, spleen, adrenals, pancreas, colon,
cecum, urinary bladder, ovaries, uterus, thyroid with parathyroid.

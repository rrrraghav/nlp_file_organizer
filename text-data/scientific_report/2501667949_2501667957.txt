DEVELOPMENT OF A MICROASSAY FOR THE DETERMINATION OF PROTEIN BY

THE METHOD OF LOWRY

-------------------------------------

main objectives:

(1) miniaturization of the established protein determination in
order to perform the assay on a microtiterplate, absorbance
measurements with a microtiterplate reader

(2) adaption of the assay performance in order to use the Tecan
Sampler-XTT 505 for liquid handling

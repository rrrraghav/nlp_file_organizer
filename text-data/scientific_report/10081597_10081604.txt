Arsenic in tobacco was first reported by Runington (1927), and since
then this subject has been reviewed in a number of publications. Recently
Batterley (1956) reported that the arsenic content of cigarettes increased
steadily from 1932 to 1951 and hypothesized that cigarette tobacco would
continue to contain large amounts of arsenic due to absorption from the
soil.

The presence of naturally occurring arsenic in plants and foods has
been reported a number of times and is especially high in certain edible
marine life (Coulson et al. 1931).

Since 1952, arsenic compounds have been removed from the list of
recommended insecticides for control of tobacco hornworms, and strenuous
efforts have been made to reduce the use of these materials on tobacco. These
efforts have been successful as indicated by the work of Bailey et al. (1956)
and Aber (1956) who showed that the arsenic content of tobacco has declined
sharply since 1952.

Widespread publicity has been given to a recent paper by Holland et al.
(1956) in which cigarettes purchased in 1957 reportedly contained 42 to 52 ppm.
of arsenic and in which speculations were made on the health aspects of such
high level of arsenic in cigarettes. In view of the interest in this subject,

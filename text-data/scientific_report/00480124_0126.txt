DISCLOSURE

This invention relates to an improved smoking product and a method
for its manufacture.

The geometry of the burning cone of smoking products currently
produced leads to a reducing atmosphere in which pyrolysis reactions
produce undesirable ingredients. This effect is created by the
restriction of the flow of air through or around the fused burning
mass, thus reducing the amount of oxygen in the area behind the
burning cone which prohibits combustion of certain gases.

This invention offers a method of manufacturing a smoking product
whose burning cone would not restrict the flow of air as much as a
conventional smoking product.

Smoking products that contain tobacco that has been shredded
finer than that found in conventional smoking products produce smoke
containing lower amounts of the undesirable ingredients.

This effect is caused by the condensing and reburning of smoke
on the increased surface area of the tobacco, thus more completely
pyrolyzing the smoke to its more desirable ingredients.

The improved smoking product, to be described, produces less
undesirable ingredients by the increased air flow through its
burning cone, or by increasing the reburning of the condensed smoke
or both.

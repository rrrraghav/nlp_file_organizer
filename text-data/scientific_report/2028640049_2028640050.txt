During the 1st quarter 1987, some 66 cigarette and some 27 filter

on PMH’s Marlboro 100s cigarettes MLH01/02, to increase smoke
delivery.

The tipping papers 4M 0.15.4.5, of Ambassador cigarettes MAA03/08
and MAK03 produced by PMH and MAA04/05 and MAK05/05, produced by
FTR were replaced by 3M 0.15.4.5 papers, to increase smoke
delivery.

The tipping papers 24/70, on FTR’s Muratti 2000 cigarettes MAB01
and MAH01, were replaced by 23/60 papers, to increase smoke
delivery.

In January, the tipping paper of FTR's Brunette Double Filtre
BRD01 changed from 24/80 to 23/60, and the special BRD filter was
replaced by the current NAA filter.

The tipping paper 23/60 of FTR’s MLK15/41 was replaced by a 24/40
paper, to increase smoke delivery.

The filter RTD of PM-UK’s Raffles was reduced from 340 to 320

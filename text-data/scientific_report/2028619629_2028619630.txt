Ames test on condensates of experimental cigarettes (NINO project)

In the present study, the mutagenicity of cigarette smoke con-
densates of 8 test (NIPUR-1, NIPUR-2, NIPUR-3, NIPUR-4, RL-1,
RL-BM, 39-17-1, 39-17-1-BM) and 1 standard reference cigarettes
(2RI) was determined in an Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium
TA 98 as a tester strain and Aroclor-induced rat liver homogenates
(59-fraction) for metabolic activation.

Cigarette smoke condensates were prepared, using an impaction
trap. All condensates were tested simultaneously using a single
tester strain suspension, a single 59-fraction preparation and
the same dose range for all types of cigarette condensates, four
plates per dose.

In the dose range tested during this study (0.05 to 0.15 mg dry
condensate/plate), all research cigarette smoke condensates showed
a linear increase in the number of revertants in the presence of
Aroclor-induced rat liver 59-fraction. The specific mutagenicity
defined as the number of revertants minus the number of spontaneous
revertants per mg dry condensate was extrapolated from the number
range of the dose response curve.

As there have been indications from other studies (see September 1975
report, Project 2010) that the mutagenicity of condensates decreased
during storage and significant variability in the test performance
could be observed, condensates of 2RI standard reference cigarettes
were used as an internal standard.

Standard reference condensates were prepared at the same time and
stored under the same conditions as the test cigarette condensates.
The specific mutagenicity of any test cigarette condensate was
related to the specific mutagenicity of the standard reference
condensate prepared and tested at the same time, i.e. the relative
specific mutagenicity.

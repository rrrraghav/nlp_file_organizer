To Dr. H. in tribute with the belief that the surface habits of hydroxy-
steroids are a reflection of their molecular structure. The synthesis of 17α-
hydroxyprogesterone derivatives is described for the first time. Coupling of 17α-
ethylidenecyclopropanoyl-Δ⁴-androstene oxide (I) with ethyl glycinate, followed
by hydrolysis and reduction affords 17α-ethyl-17β-glycine ester (II) (36%), which
upon treatment with acetic anhydride yields the corresponding amide (III) (80%). A better route is
obtained by reaction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate (IV) with ethyl chloro-
formate, which affords 17α-ethoxycarbonyl-Δ⁴-androstene acetate (V) (65%), which on
hydrolysis gives the corresponding acid (VI) (90%). Reaction of (VI) with ethylamine
yields the ethyl amide (VII) (85%) and upon reduction, 17α-ethylglycine ester (II)
is obtained. The yields are typical for these types of reactions.

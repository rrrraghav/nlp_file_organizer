Finger Coverage Study

Most American filter cigarettes are designed to reduce tar delivery by allowing air to enter the mainstream of smoke through bands of holes pierced in the paper covering the filter. It has been asserted that smokers occasionally place their fingers over that portion of the cigarette filter where the bands are located. A laboratory study has been conducted with respect to this alleged behavior and its possible influence upon FTC tar deliveries of ventilated cigarettes.

The study had the following objectives:

1) To quantify the incidence of apparent hole coverage by the fingers under reasonably representative smoking conditions.
2) To establish analytically the relationship between actual incremental hole coverage (dilution reduction) and FTC tar delivery changes.

3) To calculate from the empirical data generated in 1) and 2) the maximum changes in FTC tar delivery values which could be attributable to finger coverage of the dilution holes.

Part 1. The behavioral observations were made by an independent laboratory. The placement of fingers on cigarettes while smoking was recorded for 113 regular smokers by three concealed video cameras. The subjects had no relationship with either the investigating laboratory or the sponsor of the study, nor were they aware of the purpose of the study or that their behavior was being recorded. There were three groups of smokers drawn by brand smoked from three FTC tar delivery ranges (< 7mg., 7-12 mg. and > 12 mg.). A subject smoked one cigarette of his usual brand (a ventilated cigarette) under in situ conditions. Three judges independently determined from analysis of slow-motion playback of the video tapes when

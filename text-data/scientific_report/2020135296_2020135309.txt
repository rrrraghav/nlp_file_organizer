Monthly Report, August ‘85 Sarojini D. Arcot

I Identification of phases present in samples extracted in
Stockpile plant under various conditions:

The sample name, and the phases identified have
been tabulated (Table I)

II(a) Identification of phases present in samples prepared in
the lab, under different conditions: the variables were
atmosphere, heating cycle, starting material, temperature
of nitriding, and time of nitriding. The sample numbers,
and the phases identified in them are summarized in Table II
and the phases identified in PM639, PM 640 and PINIT 28

(b) Effect of aging 9 samples for 12 days:
in 100% Relative humidity for 12 days.
It can be seen from the attached data
that PINIT 28 is affected more by aging under
humid conditions than PM639/PM640. On the wrapped
PINIT 28, the major phase is Fe and Fe3N. On aging,
Fe becomes the major phase, and γ-FeN becomes a
minor phase, and Fe3O4 appears. It is probable that

Protocol for Enzyme Immunoassay of Nicotine

Introduction

As an alternative to RIA of nicotine, enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
is sought in order to avoid some of the disadvantages of RIA currently
available, i.e. short half-life of radiolabeled compound and its
cost involved, potential radiation hazard, etc.

EIA could be as sensitive as RIA and the assay speed could be
equally fast and efficient. Here, described the development of an
enzyme immunoassay of nicotine using β-galactosidase as an enzyme
of choice.

Preparation of the enzyme labeled nicotinc.

The compound which will be used for the enzyme immunoassay will
be 6-p-aminobenzamido nicotine. The procedure for conjugation to
the maleimide coupling agent, meta-maleimidobenzoic acid (MBA), will
be as follows.

A. Synthesis of nicotine - MBA conjugate.

1) Activation of carboxyl group of MBA by thionyl chloride.

CHAPTER 4: PHILIP MORRIS TOBACCO COMPANY PLANS AND ORGANIZATION REGARDING IARC

Introduction

The publication of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report² in 1992 marked a turning point for the tobacco industry’s strategies in dealing with the secondhand smoke issue. The risk assessment of secondhand smoke's health effects classified secondhand smoke as a Group A carcinogen, a category listed as “dangerous to humans.”³ The U.S. EPA report stimulated a proliferation of clean indoor air laws in the U.S.,⁴ and became a centerpiece of debate for the tobacco industry at the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) hearings to establish indoor air regulations for various substances, including secondhand smoke.⁵ Although OSHA still has yet to produce its rule, the precedent had been set for a major scientific report to play a major role in regulating indoor air, which restrict opportunities to smoke, cigarette consumption, and industry profits.

In contrast to the U.S. situation, Europe has not produced a European equivalent of the U.S. EPA report. European countries have been relatively slower to implement tobacco control legislation and regulations, with mixed results. As of March 1998:²

* Italy has a 1975 law forbidding smoking in all public state buildings, public transport, and cinemas; workplaces, restaurants, and bars set their own rules.

* France’s 1992 legislation restricting smoking in many public places and creating no-smoking areas in dining establishments was initially largely ignored, and has been least effective in restaurants and bars; compliance on public transport has mostly been adhered to.

* Poland enacted a comprehensive law in 1996 ending smoking in healthcare establishments, educational facilities, enclosed workplaces, and other public buildings, but few places are smoke free.

* Germany failed to pass legislation in 1998 to end smoking in all public buildings, workplaces, and public transport; some restaurants have introduced no-smoking areas, but these areas are not physically separated.

* Hungary considered a bill in 1998 ending smoking in health care institutions and restricted smoking in workplaces, restaurants, and bars. Before, smoking had only been restricted in public transport, stores, theaters, and churches.

* Public smoking has been controlled more by public pressure Britain with smoking effectively ended in many areas, although the no-smoking zones in bars and restaurants are relatively ineffective at protecting nonsmokers from the toxins in secondhand smoke.

Although implementing such legislation has varied across Europe, tobacco control legislative

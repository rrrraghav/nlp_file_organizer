Notes: (a)

Date: 03 Jun.93

EAA: On 01 and 02 Jun.93 the sample collection for particle size distribution in the 1-GR, 2-GR (1.R4F groups) and 5-GR, 6-GR (URSUS high energy groups) were carried out. On 03 Jun.93 the sample collection for 3-GR, 4-GR (URSUS low energy groups) will be performed and all samples will be transported to INBIFO on this day by DRD. We also started the measurements of the flows in the inhalation system.

Date: 03 Jun.93

EAA: All flows of the inhalation system are determined now. The sample collection for the determination of the particle size distribution has been finished today and the samples were transported to INBIFO by DRD. Tomorrow, on 04 Jun.93, we will start the preparations for additional determinations of CO, TPM, nicotine, aldehydes, and water in up to a 24-position inhalation chamber with rats. These determinations and measurements in inhalation chambers without rats will start on 07 Jun.93.

• Date: 16 Jun.93

FTE: The examination of the rat sera collected at the termination of the study revealed in 1 out of 28 serum samples a significant positive antibody titer to the pathogenic (Kühn’s) virus. The same serum sample was also positive for the murine poliovirus (GD-7) which is not pathogenic for rats. As already seen at the start and after 21 days of the study, approx. 50% of the serum samples were found to be positive for the so-called ‘rodent orphan parvovirus (ROPV) type 1’. The presence of antibodies was not sex-specific.

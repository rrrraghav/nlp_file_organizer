PROJECT TITLE: Tobacco Studies

PROJECT LEADER: H. Lanzillotti

PERIOD COVERED: November, 1984

I. Low Nicotine and Control (J. Hearn)

Objectives:

Identify mechanisms of nicotine delivery.
Develop techniques for nicotine delivery control.
Investigate subjective effects of various sources of nicotine in cigarette smoke.

Status/Plans:

Brazilian Tobaccos

Tobaccos fertilized with 0 and 300 kg./hectare of K₂SO₄ were prepared as 100% air or flue cured fillers and are being made into cigarettes. Tobaccos fertilized at 100 and 200 kg./hectare of K₂SO₄ are being blended (Air Cured Flue Cured VA Stems) and made into cigarettes. Once all these cigarettes are received, they will be submitted for smoke and chemical analyses.

Control of Nicotine Delivery

Previously, casing Marlboro filler at a 10% target level with either glucose, fructose or sucrose effected no change in nicotine delivery efficiencies. Recent experiments indicate that an isosweet casing on a high alkaloid Burley tobacco reduces the nicotine delivery efficiency by about 15%. The next experiment will follow up on this latest information by casing high alkaloid Burley, DBC Burley and DBC Bright tobaccos at 10% target levels of sugar to determine what the effects are on nicotine delivery efficiency.

Chemical Forms of Nicotine

Literature references (dating 50-60 years ago) have been found relating to the isolation of "bound" forms of nicotine from tobacco. As soon as copies of these references are in hand, work will begin to duplicate the reported results so that the compounds can be isolated and structural determinations made.

II. Nonvolatile Components of Tobacco (R. Hale)

Objective:

To separate, identify and subjectively evaluate nonvolatile components of Bright and Burley tobacco.

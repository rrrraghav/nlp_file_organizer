JJILL PSN reported the results of the particle size determinations. The median mass aerodynamic
diameters are similar to those determined after the 21-day SIGMA MS inhalation study. However,
there remains a discrepancy of the 184F results with those of previous investigations on filter
cigarettes. PSN will check the Stober centrifuge and plans to calibrate it with latex particles.

The relative organ weights are normally calculated on the basis of the body weight determined
after exsanguination. By mistake, this body weight was not determined on the first of the 2 days of
dissection after the inhalation period. Therefore, for the evaluation of the relative organ weights, I
suggest to use the body weights of the rats determined before exsanguination. In order to evaluate
possible differences of the results obtained by normalizing to the 2 types of body weight, the
relative organ weights of those rats dissected on the second day should be calculated by both
methods. Since the number of rats were small in this study I additionally
suggest to calculate and compare the relative organ weights of the 21-day SIGMA MS inhalation
study by the 2 methods.

HJHH Few rats were conspicuous because of their body weight development. After inspecting their
teeth, the lower incisor teeth of 4 rats were cut. These 4 rats will be supplemented with moistened
diet for some days to allow their recovery.

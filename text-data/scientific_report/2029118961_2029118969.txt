1.1 Objective

In the present 90-day nose-/head-only inhalation study on male
rats the influence of a filler ingredient on the biological ac-
tivity of mainstream cigarette smoke was investigated.

For this purpose, the biological activity of the cigarette X6D7EDL
(EDL), used as the reference, and the test cigarettes X6D7EDM
(EDM) and X6D7BON (EDN), both of which contained a different con-
centration of the ingredient, was compared with regard to the
following parameters:

(1) general condition and behavior of the rats,
(2) body weight,
(3) organ weights,
(4) gross pathology,
(5) histopathology of the respiratory tract, and
(6) laryngeal epithelium thickness.

1.2 Experimental Conduct (a)

96 male Sprague Dawley rats (strain CrL:CD(SD)BR, Charles River,
France), 6 weeks of age at the start of the inhalation period,
were allocated to 8 groups (12 rats per group): 1 low- and 1 high-
smoke-dose group per cigarette type and 2 sham-exposed groups .

Mainstream smoke (MS) was generated using modified 30-port
Büttelle Mark 3 smoking machines. The nominal total particulate

CIVO Toxicology and Nutrition Institute, Zeist, Netherlands,
according to a protocol prepared by IMBIFO and with the
technical assistance of INBiFO.

MICROBIOLOGICAL ASSAY OF SALENTO TOBACCO FROM
THE STATE TOBACCO MONOPOLY, TRIPOLI, LIBYA

SUMMARY
A moderate concentration of bacteria was present on the tobacco
after the original assay, but the number had diminished considerably
upon a second microbiological assay one year later. Three bacteria, all
Gram-positive rods, were isolated.

FERMENTATION PROCESS
The fermentation was carried out in wooden sided silos. The weight
of the tobacco was approximately 2,000 kilograms. This particular fermenta-
tion lasted for 22 days having an entry temperature of 30°C., a maximum
temperature of 55°C., and an exit temperature of 40°C. The aroma of the
fermentation was judged to be “sweet for the type”.

EXPERIMENTAL
Tobacco Used
Variety Salento, 1964 Crop of Libyan Origin
Microbiological and Analytical Procedure
See Appendix I.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This tobacco sample was taken on September 28, 1964, and arrived in
Louisville on October 9, 1964. It was first assayed on October 13, 1964
for total microbial count only. This assay (see Table ) yielded
approximately 62,700 microorganisms per gram dry weight of tobacco on

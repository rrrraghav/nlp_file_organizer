1 Objective

The "mutagenic activity of CONDITIONED SIDESTREAM SMOKE (CSS) obtained by ageing and by contact with surface materials as found in homes, and FRESH SIDESTREAM SMOKE (FSS) of the standard reference cigarette 2RI will be compared using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay.

2 Design and Background

This assay will be applied to investigate the *in vitro* biological activity of the 2 smoke types. This is in addition to the investigation of the *in vivo* biological activity in a subchronic inhalation study on rats (CRC study B1021). The smoke samples will be collected during the inhalation period from the sham group and the groups with the highest FSS and CSS concentrations. The smoke will be collected as total particulate matter (TPM) (s). The samples will be analyzed for their mutagenic activity as soon as

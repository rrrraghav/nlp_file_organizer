ABSTRACT
--------------------
Start-up of AMF Legg annular dryers in BOZ; trials and related evaluations.

OBJECTIVE
--------------------
To qualify the AMF Legg annular dryers in BOZ on the Marlboro blend.

During week 6, 1987, the start-up of two newly installed AMF Legg dryers took place at PMH-BOZ. Full assistance was given by R&D Process Development Neuchâtel, and representatives of the Engineering Group Richmond.

On the basis of a program established by the local management and in order to find the best AMF dryer set-up, some fine-tuning trials were carried out prior to the test run. The results of these pre-trials were evaluated and the set-up parameters reviewed and finalized for a first test run (Batch No. 654) as shown below :

PROJECT TITLE : HEAT

PERIOD COVERED : March 16 - April 15, 1983

WRITTEN BY : Pladé-J.-J. (UJP), Lauper-G. (GLA)
Genoud-Y. (YVG).

OBJECTIVE

Improvement of low grade Burley organoleptic properties by
in-situ generation of flavours.

PRESENT STATUS

Treatments were continued as described earlier (1).
Additional tested additives included rhamnose and ascorbic acid.

ANALYTICAL DETERMINATIONS

Profiling of volatiles by GC² and identification of
meaningful peaks found in treated samples are being carried
out. Tobacco pyrolysis has been discontinued. As an
alternative, hand-made cigarettes from the treated tobaccos
are smoked and semi-volatiles in tar are profiled. Amadori
compound pyrolysis is being continued.

Sugar analysis has shown that the consumption rate of glucose
at a temperature of 95°C is faster than that of fructose.

PANEL TESTING

After a first series of smoking sessions by tobacco experts,
two trials were retained as promising with 10% fructose and
with 10% fructose + 10% glucose sprayings, both tobaccos
were heated to 95°C.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT SUMMARY FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1973

TITLE: Expanded Tobacco

OBJECTIVE:

Improved filling capacity.

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES:

Complete Tobacco Blend "Stiffening" - Jetstream and ADT Dryers

Comparison runs with the closed loop ADT dryer and the Jetstream unit showed a compacimeter filling power increase in the range of 12% respectively when compared to regular ADT dryer. Initial flavor group evaluation of finished cigarettes at both equal weight and a % weight reduction, show differences primarily attributable to differences in cigaret delivery versus the new drying operation. Cigarettes designed to give equal delivery versus control will be necessary to see if any real subjective differences occur due to the processing step.

ADT Dryer Optimization

The experimental pilot plant ADT dryer setup is designed to also examine air drying parameters as well as those of the closed loop operation. First runs have begun with a goal of determining relative drying contribution of this convective-conductive type dryer.

Water Impregnation - Expansion

First attempts at moving the impregnation step from bench scale equipment to small pilot scale units resulted in a decrease of a significant portion of the expansion previously seen (50 vs 75 cc/10 gms.). Subsequent studies show short vacuum release time and minimum "clumping" of fibers are required to obtain a high degree of expansion. Present material from this study is in the 60-65 cc/10 gms. range primarily due to accelerated vacuum release.

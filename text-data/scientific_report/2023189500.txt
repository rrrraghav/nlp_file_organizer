CONCEPT

CONCENTRATION AND PERSISTENCE
OF SELECTED N-NITROSAMINES AND NICOTINE
IN MATERIALS EXPOSED TO SIDESTREAM CIGARETTE SMOKE

1 Objective

Determine the concentration of tobacco-specific and volatile N-
nitrosamines as well as of nicotine in the carpet, curtain, the wall
paper, and on glass surfaces which were exposed to sidestream smoke
of the standard reference cigarette 2R1 in the conditioning room
(D1021) for approx. 100 consecutive days.

2 Experimental Design

The determination of nicotine and the N-Nitrosamines will start as
soon as the smoke exposure of the conditioning room will have been
stopped. It will be continued for several weeks or until no further
traces of the analytes can be determined. The conditioning room air (as
for R1021) will be continuously flushed with conditioned air (as
during the light/dark cycle
will continue to be operating during this period.

The test components will be eluted from defined and randomly
selected areas of carpet, curtain, and wall paper or removed from
glass surfaces by blotting with glass fiber filter material soaked
with dichloromethane.

Analytical Parameters:
(1) nicotine
(2) volatile nitrosamines
(3) TSNAs
(4) continuous monitoring of temperature and relative humidity in
the conditioning room

3 Methods

Careful removal of pieces of carpet and curtain (wearing gloves)
5 cm x 5 cm, and wall paper, 10 cm x 10 cm from defined areas within
with a Teflon roller. Wiping of glass window area (20 cm x 10 cm)
with glass fibre filter (capable of retaining water), rinsed with
dichloromethane. Collection of 2 samples per time point (not possible
areas (FIGURES 1 to 3). Determination of sample weight.

Licorice extract powder (spray dried) has virtually replaced "block" licorice extract for most product and flavor applications. In fact, the spray dried Licorice rawies tends to be more uniform in taste. For either type of Licorice, the glycyrrhizin content is the critical flavor factor relative to sweetness. Occasionally, either type of Licorice can have “scorched notes” and such batches should be rejected.
(See Licorice extract; FEMA# 2629).

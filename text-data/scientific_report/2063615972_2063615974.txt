YEAST MITOTIC GENE CONVERSION ASSAY (with 6908)²

To confirm and extend the results reported last month³,
twelve base fractions were tested in duplicate and their specific
activities were compared to the measured levels of 2-amino-α-carboline
(2AC), harman, and norharman. The results showed a correlation between
2AC concentration and base fraction activity (r = 0.738, p<0.01). Experi-
ments are planned to determine if 2AC is active in this assay.

In the above experiments, a 2RI base fraction prepared with
the use of ether gave a linear dose response at doses similar to a 2RI
IT CSC (0.2-0.6 mg/plate).³ Because earlier experiments had shown that
base fractions prepared by the ether method were active at much lower
doses (<0.1 mg/plate)⁴, an experiment was conducted to retest IT CSC
base fractions (including one from 2RI) which had been prepared by the
ether extraction and stored at -80°C for more than a year.⁵ The results
showed that the old base fractions were active in the previously observed
low dose range. Additional experiments are planned to investigate the
discrepancy between the activities of the old and new 2RI base fractions.

2. L5178Y THYMINE KINASE MUTATION ASSAY⁶,⁷

The results of several experiments conducted this month
indicated that the cloning efficiency (CE) problem is not a reflection
of the variation observed in the assay. Additional intensive efforts
are in progress to investigate the cause(s) of the CE problem.

3. BHK CELL TRANSFORMATION ASSAY⁸

Final work on the assay was completed with the issuance of
a completion report.⁹

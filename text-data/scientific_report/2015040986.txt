Title: Immunological Competence and Chemical Carcinogenesis.

Objective: The specific research aim of this study is to elucidate the possible role played by the host immune mechanism during chemical carcinogenesis. Initially, the basic immunological status of several strains of mice was examined. Plaque forming responses to six different antigens were measured in both sexes of each of seven strains of mice. This involved individual assays on over 1500 mice. Based on these data, in conjunction with Drs. Whitmire and Kouri of Microbiological Associates Inc., it was decided to utilize strains C3H/Db/2 and C57B1/6 for the second phase of the study with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). Goat erythrocytes were selected as the test antigen, and the kinetics of the immune response to goat erythrocytes were measured in each strain.

Grant number 3340 Progress Period from 11/01/92 to: 11/01/93

Name of Investigator: Tad H. Koch

Title of Original Grant: Nucleic Acid Photodeavage and Photocrosslinking
to Associated Proteins

Abstract of the Specific Aims as stated in the original application:
Our specific aims are: 1) to identify the amino acid residue of the Bacteriophage
R17 coat protein to which a covalent bond is formed upon 308 nm excitation of its
photocrosslinking chromophore of the JM-15 variant RNA hairpin loop, 2) to test
photocrosslinking to JMs with proteins bearing mutations at or near the reactive
amino acid residue which place other reactive amino acid residues in proximity to the
Bru, 3) to identify the amino acid residue of the GA coat protein which crosslinks to JM.
15. 4) to participate with the Untenbeck group in modeling R17 and GA
bacteriophages. 5) to establish in collaboration with the Czech group the amino acid
residues of the α and β-subunits of the Oxytricha nova telomere binding protein which
photocrosslinks to specific Bru-substituted, synthetic DNA of the form
d(T4G4). 6) to participate with the Czech group in modeling the telomeric region
of the Oxytricha nova telomere binding protein. 7) to use the photocrosslinking
technique with a Bru-substituted, synthetic DNA with the repeat TTAGGG to help
identify the human telomere binding protein, again in collaboration with the Czech
group. 8) to identify the structural requirements for Bru specific photo cutting of RNA,
and 9) to establish that photo reactivity from the indole chromophore can be achieved in
the absence of possible photo reactivity from the Bru chromophore of tryptophan by
excitation at 325 nm with emission from a HeCd laser.

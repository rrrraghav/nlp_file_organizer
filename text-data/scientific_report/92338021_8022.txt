REVIEW OF
"LUNG CANCER IN NONSMOKING WOMEN:
A MULTICENTER CASE-CONTROL STUDY"

Fontnam, Correa, Wu-Williams, Reynolds, R. Greenberg,
Buffler, Chan, Boyd, Alterman, Austin, Liff and D. Greenberg

Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, 1, 35-45, 1991.

SUMMARY

* The Fontnam study is the largest case-control study of lifetime nonsmokers and lung cancer reported to date in the scientific literature, involving 431 nonsmoking cases and 794 population controls.

* The authors state that the study was designed specifically to address some of the methodological faults of previous studies of ETS and lung cancer, including inadequate attention to confounding factors and misclassification of smoking status and inadequate confirmation of lung cancer diagnosis.

* The authors claim that the study provides the strongest available evidence that ETS increases the risk for lung cancer in nonsmokers.

MAJOR FINDINGS

* The study reports a statistically significant relative risk for adenocarcinoma of 1.47 based on spousal smoke exposure.

* The study reports a statistically significant dose-response trend for adenocarcinoma based on spousal smoking, noting increased risk with increased exposure.

* ETS exposure in the workplace and social settings also is addressed. The authors report a statistically significant 40 to 60 percent increase in adenocarcinoma risk with ETS exposure in both settings.

* No significant association is reported between exposure to ETS in childhood and risk of lung cancer.

* No significant association is reported for all cell types examined based on spousal smoking.

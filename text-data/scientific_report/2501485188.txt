Introduction

In July 1984, London Transport decided to enforce a ban on smoking
in all its Underground trains. This decision presented an ideal
opportunity to study the effect of banning smoking on the atmosphere
of a heavily populated public environment.

Interest in the contribution of tobacco smoke to ambient air has been
prompted by much argument, scientific and otherwise, over the effect
of what is often called “passive smoking”. This paper sets out to
describe what’s meant by ambient smoke, how it may be measured and
what the typical concentrations were in the case of Underground
train compartments.

Passive Smoking?

The US Surgeon General has described passive smoking as "the inhalation
by the non-smoker of tobacco combustion products from smoke filled
atmospheres". However, ambient smoke bears only little relationship
to mainstream smoke and any comparison between smoking and inhaling
ambient smoke should take this into consideration.

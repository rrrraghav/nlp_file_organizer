PROJECT TITLE: SMOKER SIMULATION STUDIES

PERIOD COVERED: June 1 - June 29, 1973

DATE OF REPORT: July 10, 1973

PROJECT LEADER: George C. Kiritsis

1. DATA COLLECTION

   A. Upgrading

      Additional recording units are being prepared to facilitate
      subject data collection. The collection of additional smoker profile
      data is an on-going part of this project. The Engineering Services
      Division completed the preparation of additional cigarret holders
      to accomodate various types of cigarets for the recording of human
      smoking patterns.

   B. Smoking Pattern Results

     1. Cigaret Holders (Cigar Tip vs. Severed Filter Tip)

        The statistical evaluation of the smoking data from the
        computer readout, to determine if smoking differences existed
        between the cigar tip and the severed filter tip, showed that either
        tip can be used in a product test, but the tips cannot be mixed
        within a study. Furthermore, subjects smoked the same cigaret dif-
        ferently with the two tips but the direction of the difference was
        not consistent from one smoker to another.

     2. Filter vs. Non-Filter Study

        A product test comparing a filter (Marlboro 85) cigaret
        vs. non-filter (PM Commander) cigaret was completed.

       a. PM Commander Smokers on Marlboro 85

          Smoked fewer puffs, had a slightly lower
          volume per puff and a lower flow rate, compared
          to their own brand.

       b. Marlboro 85 Smokers on PM Commander

          Smoked more puffs with essentially the
          same volume and flow rate compared to their
          own brand.

       c. All Smokers Combined

          Smoked the Marlboro 85: fewer puffs,
          lower puff volume and lower flow rate
          compared to the PM Commander.

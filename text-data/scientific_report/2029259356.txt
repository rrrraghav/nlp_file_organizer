CHARACTERIZATION OF MASTER CELL BANK

The 10H3 cell line was tested for viral contamination by 3 types of indicator cell lines. The testing was conducted as a result of a conversation with Dr. Kozak (June 17, 1993), which determined the specific needs that had to be addressed for characterization of adventitious agents. The consensus reached was as follows: 1) an *in vitro* incubation of the 10H3 culture supernatant or cell line lysate with three separate indicator cells was to be performed and 2) the *in vivo* animal study could be postponed until later.

The *in vitro* assay for the presence of viral contaminants was performed by Microbiological Associates, Inc. The study report that is included on the following pages shows no evidence of viral contamination.

Abstract

Transfer from nicotine (1), various nicotic carboxylic acid salts (2 and 3),
and from Burley Bright and Oriental tobacco samples to nicotine in the gas
phase has been examined by thermogravimetric/differential thermal
analysis/mass spectroscopy (TG/DTA/MS) and evolved gas analysis (EGA).
Under the conditions used in these studies, the peak transfer temperatures of
these substances to nicotine in the gas phase are: nicotine and nicotine acetate,
both ca. 110-125°C; nicotic malates, ca. 160-210°C; and nicotine
bis(hydrogen-(2R,3R)-tartrate), ca. 195-210°C. The peak appearance
temperatures of nicotine in the tobacco samples were observed in a range of
ca. 160-220°C. These results suggest that nicotic is mostly in its protonated
forms in tobacco leaf. In all cases, the temperature of the transfer of nicotine
to the gas phase was found to be many hundreds of degrees below the
temperatures observed around the coal of a burning cigarette (smolder, ca.
500-775°C; dynamic smoking, 600 to over 950°C). Within the narrow zone
of a puffing cigarette that encompasses an intermediate temperature range
(125-250°C), kinetic data suggest that these temperatures are not sufficient to
volatilize significant amounts of nonprotonated nicotine, assuming any exists
at all, during the short puff duration (2 seconds). It is concluded that
nonprotonated nicotic and protonated nicotic (salts of nicotic with natural

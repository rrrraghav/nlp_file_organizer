All animals were dosed by gavage. Each animal was dosed daily for eleven (11) days. Animals were weighed on Day 1, Day 8, and termination (Day 12). On Day 3, all animals were injected I.P. with 0.3 ml of 2% suspension of sheep red blood cells in 0.9% NaCl. On the day following the last day of treatment (Day 12), each animal was anesthetized with carbon dioxide gas and the blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The spleen, thymus, and adrenals were then removed and weighed.

After the blood clotted, it was centrifuged and the serum was removed. The serum was inactivated by heating for 30 minutes at 56°C in a water bath to destroy complement activity. The serum was then tested for hemagglutinating activity to SRBC.

Serial two-fold 0.9% NaCl dilutions of the serum were made in 0.05 ml volumes in depression trays, and 0.05 ml of 1% washed sheep red blood cells were added to each well. Samples were prepared in duplicate. The trays were agitated to mix the contents of the wells, then covered and incubated for three hours at 27°C. Wells were scored for agglutination using a 0 to 4 scale, by inspection, and an antibody index calculated for each serum sample. An A.I. value of 0.5 or lower was taken as the limiting value.

RESULTS

Agglutination scores and the calculated antibody index are presented in Table 1. Antibody production was suppressed in animals treated with 6-mercaptopurine. No suppression of antibody production was noted in animals treated with the test article, B-166.

Animal #402347 (Group 2) did not produce a sufficient blood sample for an agglutination assay and was replaced by #26 (#402347R). Animal #402350 (Group 2) died on study and was replaced by #48 (#402360R). Animal #402364 (Group 4) was not dosed with SRBC and was replaced with #4 (#402364R).

The individual and mean terminal body weights, organ weights and organ/body weight ratios are presented in Table 2. The mean thymus weights and mean thymus/body weight ratios of animals treated with 6-mercaptopurine were lower than animals treated with the vehicle; no effect was noted on the weight of the spleen or adrenals.

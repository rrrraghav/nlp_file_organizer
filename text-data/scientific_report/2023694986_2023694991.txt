Pulmonary Reactive Uptake of Inhaled Toxic Contaminants

PI: Edward M. Postlethwait, Ph.D.
University of Texas Medical Branch
Pulmonary Division

The proposed project is designed to characterize and compare across species (including man) the kinetics of interaction and the predominant substrates involved during the pulmonary airspace absorption of NO2 and O2 with the goal of establishing a model for evaluating relative dosimetry. The researchers will delineate the absorption determinants of NO2 and O2 within the intact, isolated lung, followed by the determination of the extent to which uptake is localized to within the epithelial lining fluid (ELF).

STATUS: August 1991

Several studies related to nitrogen dioxide reactive uptake by the pulmonary airspace surface were completed. A comparison between bulk phase exposures and “thin films” has been undertaken both for determining mechanisms of toxicity and to further validate the use of isolated epithelial lining fluid (ELF) as an investigational model. The data support the concept that NO2 reactive absorption is limited to near the

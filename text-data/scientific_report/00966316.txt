INTRODUCTION

This study was designed to evaluate the induction potential of the test article, B-146, by monitoring increases in microsomal mixed function oxidase activity. Decreased sleep-time response in mice to hexobarbital is used in this study as a non-specific indicator of hepatic microsomal activity. The p-nitroanisole 0-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase activities of isolated rat liver microsomes are used to measure more specific forms of liver induction.

TEST ARTICLE

The test article, B-146, is a clear liquid, and was received from the sponsor on March 30, 1983. The test article was refrigerated in the containers in which it was received. Methylcellulose (1%) was used as the vehicle in this study.

Appropriate amounts of B-146 were mixed with methylcellulose (1%) to achieve the correct dose level. The concentration of B-146 in the mixture was adjusted so that the volume administered was 10 ml/kg body weight. All mixtures were thoroughly agitated just prior to and continually during dosing.

HEXOBARBITAL SLEEP-TIME ASSAY

Test Animals

Fifteen male and fifteen female CD albino mice, purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, Massachusetts), weighing between 23.8-32.2 grams for males and 21.4-23.7 grams for females, were selected for this study. Prior to placement on study, the animals were quarantined for at least seven days and observed daily for appearance and behavior. The animals were group housed (5/cage) in suspended stainless steel wire-mesh bottom cages. Purina® Rodent Laboratory Chow® #5001 and water were available ad libitum.

Experimental Design

At the end of the quarantine period, healthy animals were assigned to the following treatment groups using a computer-generated random number listing:

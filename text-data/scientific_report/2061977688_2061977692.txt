1 SUMMARY
======

In the present 21-day inhalation study the influence of SIDESTREAM
and MAINSTREAM CIGARETTE SMOKE of the standard reference cigarette
type 2R1 on selected responses of free lung cells (PLC) will be
investigated.

The objectives of this study are:

(1) the application of flow cytometry in combination with or
in place of conventional ELIC methods and

(2) the selection of a reproducible lavage method for future
studies.

144 rats will be randomly allocated to 3 groups, 60 for sham
control, 60 for mainstream smoke and 24 for sidestream smoke
exposure. The head-only exposure will be performed for 420
minutes/day at 0.27 milligrams/liter total particulate matter
(TPM) corresponding to a daily dose of 120 minutes x milligram/
liter TPM for mainstream smoke and at 0.07 milligrams/liter TPM
corresponding to a daily dose of 35 minutes x milligram/liter TPM
for sidestream smoke. Rats will be exposed 7 days/week for a
period of 21 days. This study will be divided into 3 subsequent
experiments. Sidestream exposure will only take place in the 3rd
experiment.

To ascertain the hygienic status of the rats prior to and at
the end of the study, 9 rats will be investigated microbiologi-
cally. The microbiological quality controls will include the
search for virological, bacteriological and parasitological
infections in the rats. Bacteriological controls of the laboratory
units, staff, diet, drinking water and cage bedding material

of Environmental Tobacco Smoke ("ETS") on the cardiovascular

order.

Several criteria must be satisfied, of course,
before a study can be said to support a causal hypothesis
that would link environmental exposure -- whether to ETS or
any other substance or agent -- and adverse health effects.
The following criteria apply to both epidemiological and
clinical experimental studies:

1. Estimates or measurements of exposure and/or
dose must be accurate and verifiable. This means, among

2. The study must be rigorously and appropriately
designed. This requires adequate sample size, the use of

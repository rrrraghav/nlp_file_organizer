ADDENDUM TO PRESSURE MEASURING TESTS

MEASUREMENTS OF VENTILATION IN A BARCLAY 85 CIGARETTE

SUBJECTED TO VARYING LIP PRESSURES

Introduction

Tests were conducted using a set of simulated lips to
determine the effect of lip pressure on ventilation in a Barclay
85 cigarette. Pressures applied to the cigarette by the “lips”
were measured using the same sensing bulb method employed in the
determination of human lip pressure. We found that the decrement
in ventilation was less than 2% at a lip pressure of 100 torr
(about three times the average human lip pressure). We further
determined that the ventilation decrement was only mildly
dependent upon the position of the cigarette in the “lips”.

Apparatus and Methods

The simulated lips were designed and constructed by H. S.
Porenski of Brown and Williamson, to mimic the action of human
lips as closely as possible. The lips consist of inflatable thin
wall tubing and are constrained to fit around the cigarette by a

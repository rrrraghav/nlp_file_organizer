PERIOD COVERED: September, 1981

I. EXTRUDED TOBACCO

The Wenger cooking extruder was received and is currently being installed.

Work has been conducted to enhance the overall quality of the extruded tobacco sheet. Finer particle size (less than 100 mesh) RCB feedstock appears to improve sheet uniformity and strength.

Further attempts have been made to reduce the quantity of Klucel in the tobacco formulation. Sheets produced with 5% solids (5% Klucel, 10% starch, 85% RCB feedstock) were satisfactory. The presence of starch in the formulation appears to alter the way in which Klucel is distributed in the tobacco.

Initial work was begun with the Haake viscometer to study the rheology of Klucel solutions at various shear rates. Initial results suggest that solutions behave as a pseudoplastic material. Test results will be used to aid in die design and to establish initial extrusion conditions.

II. ADHESIVE APPLICATION

The Findley adhesive foamer was used to provide 50% foamed adhesive for evaluation on the P-S. Test results indicated large bubble size formation. Examination of the foamer led to several modifications and repairs to generate the correct foam consistency. Testing is being performed to establish taste and odor acceptance and actual adhesive usage.

III. CAM III

Various filter samples have been produced for Manufacturing Engineering. Samples have been used to test equipment and evaluate various filter designs.

Several encapsulated flavors have been obtained from suppliers to study flavor release potential. Efforts have been directed at determining which encapsulating material (sucrose, maltodextrin, etc.) is most susceptible to the moisture in the filter during smoking. Testing has shown that sufficient water is present to dissolve the encapsulating material.

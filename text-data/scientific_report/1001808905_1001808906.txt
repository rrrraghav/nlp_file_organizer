Synopsis by R. P. Gerber, Ph.D.

Scopoletin and scopolin have been identified in the tobacco
plant, but only scopoletin appears in the smoke. A new quantitative
method for scopoletin in smoke condensate (CORESTA standards) has
been worked out. It comprises these steps:

Liquid-liquid partition: Three partitions remove non-phenolic
and some phenolic compounds from the condensate. (Figure 1)
Recoveries are 96+ %.

Column chromatography with CHCl3 on a polyamide powder
further purifies the scopoletin fraction. Recovery is 100%
(Table 2).

UV-spectrophotometry (Figure 2). The differential extinction
of scopoletin in two solvents is a direct measure of its
concentration. (5.5 in the manuscript). Spectrophotometric
calibration with known solutions supplies the conversion factor
(5.6).

The specificity of the method is discussed under 6.1.
Reproducibility results are listed in Table 3. Ten determinations
made with the same smoke condensate gave a mean of 14.17 µg/Cigt.
Standard deviation 0.267 µg/Cigt.

The accuracy is checked by determining total scopoletin in a
previously analyzed condensate to which known amounts of

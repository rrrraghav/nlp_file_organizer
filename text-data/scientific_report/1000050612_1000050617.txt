A DISTILLATION METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF
INORGANIC BROMIDE IN CURED TOBACCO
by L. Teet

1. INTRODUCTION

Banks, Demarcheller and Elek (1) outline four main
methods for the analysis of bromide in foodstuffs.
A simple and faster distillation method is described
in this paper. Its accuracy and reproducibility are
compared with neutron activation, X-ray fluorescence
and iodometric methods.

2. METHOD

lg finely ground cured tobacco leaves is heated
slowly (3 - 4 h) to 450 - 475°C and maintained at that
temperature until it becomes a white ash, or preferably
ashed overnight for 15 hours. The ash is transferred
to a Markham still with a brush through a small glass
funnel and is washed down with 5 ml distilled water.
A volume of 5 ml oxidizing mixture, containing
400 ml 1.25 M aqueous chromium trioxide and 300 ml
concentrated sulphuric acid, is added. Steam is
admitted to the still where selective oxidation of
bromide to bromine takes place and this is distilled
into 25 ml of 10% potassium iodide until 100 ml have
been collected. The liberated iodine is titrated
with 0.005N sodium thiosulphate using a 1% starch
solution as indicator and a 10 ml burette graduated
in 0.02 ml.

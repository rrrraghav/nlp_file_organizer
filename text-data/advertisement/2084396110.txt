THEATER

A Daring New Work About a Man Who Is Not Quite There

By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

The playwright Young Jean Lee is known for her confrontational, often unsettling works that challenge theatrical conventions and explore the anxieties of our time. Her latest, “Straight White Men,” now at the Public Theater, is no exception. It’s a play that begins with a seemingly simple premise — four white men gather for Christmas dinner with their estranged mother — but quickly spirals into a complex meditation on race, gender, privilege and identity.

The play’s structure is deceptively straightforward. The characters are not particularly well-defined, and the dialogue often feels like an extended philosophical debate rather than a natural conversation. But it is in this very lack of conventional narrative that Ms. Lee finds her power. She forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about ourselves and our society, and she does so with a relentless honesty that can be both exhilarating and exhausting.

The play’s most striking feature is its use of repetition. Certain phrases and images recur throughout the performance, creating a sense of disorientation and unease. This technique serves to highlight the cyclical nature of prejudice and the difficulty of breaking free from ingrained patterns of thought.

“Straight White Men” is not an easy play to watch. It’s challenging, provocative and at times deeply disturbing. But it is also a work of great intelligence and originality, and one that deserves to be seen by anyone interested in the future of American theater.

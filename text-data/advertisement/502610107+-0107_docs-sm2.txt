"The Camel Expedition Edition is a tribute to the spirit of adventure and exploration that has always been part of the American tradition."

We’ve created a special edition of CAMEL cigarettes to honor those who have dared to push beyond the known. These are men who have faced challenges, overcome obstacles, and achieved greatness through courage and determination. They are explorers, pioneers, adventurers—men like Thomas Cook.

Thomas Cook was one of the first modern travel agents. He organized excursions for temperance societies in 1841, and soon expanded his business to include international tours. His vision and entrepreneurial spirit helped make travel accessible to millions.

CAMEL cigarettes share a similar heritage of innovation and exploration. We were the first cigarette to combine Turkish tobacco with American bright leaf—a unique blend that created a smoother, more satisfying smoke. 

Just as Thomas Cook opened up new worlds for travelers, CAMEL has always been a symbol of adventure and discovery. So light a Camel Expedition Edition and celebrate the spirit of exploration!

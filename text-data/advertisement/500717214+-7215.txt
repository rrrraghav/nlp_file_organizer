Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined
That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.

“FISHERMAN I”

Brace yourself for
the new low ‘tar’ menthol
that challenges high ‘tars.’

You're the type that gets satisfaction out of a
challenge. And we've got one for you. We challenge you
to test Brookwood against your favorite high tar menthol.
That’s what menthol smokers did in nationwide tests.
And their high tars couldn’t out-satisfy
Brookwood. Yet Brookwood has only half the tar.
Take the challenge. Compare the rich tobacco taste. The cool
rush of menthol. The smooth, easy draw. Then you'll know
why we have the nerve to challenge high tars.

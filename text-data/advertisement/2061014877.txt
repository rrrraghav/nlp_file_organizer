ONE THAT’S Worth KNOWING

In practically every cigarette you'll find some light Virginia tobacco.

But in Virginia hounds you are only this time-mellowed bright leaf—and
taste only its mild, evolving flavor. That is Benson & Hedges’ way of making
a distinctly different and delightful cigarette for your perfect smoking
enjoyment. Won’t you smoke them awhile—and see?

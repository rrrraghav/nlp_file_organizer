WOMEN IN THE WAR

They’re doing their bit—
Count it all the more wonderful
that they can still smile!
A Camel a day helps keep
the spirits bright and high.

FIND
FRESHNESS
AND SO
EASY A THROAT!

The “T-Zone”—where cigarettes
are judged

The taste comes from the blend of
Turkish and Domestic tobaccos.
That’s why Camels are different—
mild, yet satisfying.  A Camel is
a smoke that leaves you feeling
good all over.

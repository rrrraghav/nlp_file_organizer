Camels
MADE FROM FINE, NOBLE
EXPENSIVE TOBACCOS



WHEN YOU WANT A CIGARETTE
THAT’S MILDER AND MORE FLAVORFUL—
A CIGARETTE THAT SATISFIES—
YOU WANT A CAMEL!

CAMELS ARE DIFFERENT. They're made of a special blend of fine, ripe Turkish and bright Virginia tobaccos. This unique combination gives Camels a distinctive flavor that’s mild, yet full-bodied. It’s a flavor you can’t get from any other cigarette.

Camels are not too hot—not too strong—just right! They burn evenly and leave behind no unpleasant aftertaste.

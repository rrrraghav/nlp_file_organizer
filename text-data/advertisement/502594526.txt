NEVER CURING • NEVER TOASTED

CAMELS
are always
FRESH!

Since the first Camel was
made, a great many people
have said that “Turkey
Red” tobacco is the best
tobacco in the world.
They have said it because
it is the only kind of to-
bacco used in Camels.

A LITTLE BETTER ON
EVERY STRIKE!

fresher, FRESHER, freshest!

CAMELS
are made from a special blend of “Turkey Red” tobacco—a blend that is aged and mellowed until it has attained the very peak of perfection. This unique process gives Camels a freshness and flavor that no other cigarette can possibly duplicate.

The Camel’s distinctive color and aroma are proof of its exceptional quality.



Always ask for Camels!
They're sold everywhere.

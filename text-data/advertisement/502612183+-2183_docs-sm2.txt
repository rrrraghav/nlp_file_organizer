To the 3,000,000
people who started
smoking this year.

Despite all the arguments against smoking, one simple fact remains.
Last year, three million people started to smoke.
This year, the criticism will continue. And next year, too. But after all is said
and done, another three million people will probably start smoking.
Maybe the people who criticize smoking should stare the facts in the face.
Then they might recommend that if you’ve decided to smoke, but are concerned
about ‘tar’ and nicotine, you might smoke Vantage.
Vantage offers smokers the rich, tobacco flavor they've come to appreciate.
With a substantial cut in ‘tar’ and nicotine.

So if you’re one of those smokers who is now
deciding between high ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarettes
that taste good, and low ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarettes
that taste like nothing, you might appreciate Vantage.
Because Vantage is both high in flavor and low
in ‘tar’ and nicotine.

That's why so many people who have
smoked for many years have switched
to Vantage.

And that’s why, if you’ve just started
to smoke this year, we suggest you try
Vantage yourself.

The Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.

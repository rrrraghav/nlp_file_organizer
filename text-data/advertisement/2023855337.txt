The difference in price is just

a few pennies...

the difference in protection
is priceless!



Only Kent goes to the extra
expense to protect you with
MICROSCOPIC FILTERING

 KENT’s exclusive MICRONITE FILTER removes millions
of microscopic particles and tar particles that slip right through con-
ventional filters. That's why KENT’s MICRONITE FILTER makes out more
nicotine and less tar—more smoking flavor—yet it leaves to
the rich, full flavor of KENT’s fine tobacco.

Take your choice - REGULAR or
new KING SIZE – same price

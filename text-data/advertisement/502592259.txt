Camels ring true!
They’ll give you news notions about
how delightful a cigarette can be!



YOU get to smoking Camels because
you like them better—that's all the time they
take to prove their worth.

Camel quality makes Camels so satisfying,
so continuously delightful. A rare expert
blend of choice Turkish and choice Domestic
tobaccos gives Camels a wonderful mildness
and mellow body.

You have only to compare Camels with any
cigarettes in the world as any one is going to know
that Camels are different—they’re better!

And, Camels never leave any unpleasant
cigarette aftertaste of impression: dignity
odor!

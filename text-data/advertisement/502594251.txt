Have you tried Camels?

The smoky richness in the taste
of Camel cigarettes is due to a
special blend of fine Turkish and
Domestic tobaccos. It’s a flavor
that lingers—a satisfaction that
lasts!

There are thousands who declare it to
be the most delightful smoke they have
ever known.  And there are millions
who prefer Camels to any other cigarette.

Camels are made with extra care,
with every detail attended to. They’re
mild yet full-flavored—satisfying to
the last puff.

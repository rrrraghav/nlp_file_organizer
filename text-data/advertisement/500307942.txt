"I know
something
you don’t
know."

“I know
the government is making
a certain cigarette gas as
controversial as tar.”

“I know
some independent
researchers are saying
many ‘low tar’ cigarettes are
actually high in this gas.”

“I know
my new Lark II is more than
low tar—it reduces
this gas dramatically.”

“And I know,
along with low ‘tar’ and low gas;
it gives me a taste I really like.”

"I smoke
New Lark II.
Only 0 mg. tar,*
8 mg. gas.

Because I know."



8 mg. “tar”, 0.7 mg. nicotine as separate by FTC Method.

Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined
That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.

XS2G-1—It’s the Navy's new dive-bombing sensation—Test Pilot Bill Ward at the stick

HOW DOES IT FEEL to dive straight down from several miles up?
Bill Ward knows. He’s the test pilot who puts these Navy planes through
their paces. “It’s a thrill,” he says, “like feedin’ the pure stuff!”
(In the picture at the left, above, making his feed-the-pure-stuff run!)

“YOU CAN CHUCKLE and say ‘pop,’ but I tell you,” says
Bill Ward, "this action really is something. You feel like you're
pulling out of your dive—after a ride like that, a cool,
smooth Camel tastes mighty fine.”

NOTHING COMES EVEN CLOSE TO
CAMELS WITH THEIR MILDER WAY
AND, MAN, WHAT A SMOOTH FLAVOR!

The smoke of slower-burning Camels contains

NICOTINE

Than the average of the other four leading cigarettes. Based on an independent scientific test of the smoke itself.

PER PACK!



Test Pilot Bill Ward shares the Navy man’s preference
for the cigarette of gentler tobaccos...Camel!

SPEAKING OF GENTLER TOBACCOS…
“It's a fact,” says Bill Ward, “Camels are milder. I like a cigarette that doesn’t bite. And Camels give you a smoother, more satisfying smoke than any other cigarette I’ve ever tried.” That’s what makes them so good—that’s what comes with mildness.

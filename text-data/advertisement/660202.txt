Appendix III
(See also Appendixes I & II)

To the 56,000,000
people who smoke
cigarettes.

A lot of people have been telling you not to smoke, especially cigarettes with
high ‘tar’ and nicotine. But smoking provides you with a pleasure you don't want
to give up.

Naturally, we’re prejudiced. We’re in the business of selling cigarettes.
But there is one overriding fact that transcends whether you should or
shouldn’t smoke and that fact is that you do smoke.
And what are they going to do about that?

They can continue to exhort you not to smoke. Or they might look really
in the face and recommend that if you smoke and want low ‘tar’ and nicotine
in a cigarette, you smoke a cigarette like Vantage.

And we'll go along with that, because there is no other cigarette like Vantage.
Except Vantage.

Vantage has a unique filter that allows rich flavor
to come through it and yet substantially cuts down
on ‘tar’ and nicotine.

Not that Vantage is the lowest ‘tar’ and nicotine
cigarette. (But you probably wouldn't like the lowest
‘tar’ and nicotine cigarette anyway.)

The plain truth is that smoke has to
come through a filter if taste is to come
through a filter. And where there is taste
there has to be some ‘tar’.

But Vantage is the only cigarette that
gives you so much flavor with so little ‘tar’
and nicotine.

So much flavor that you'll never miss
your high ‘tar’ cigarette.

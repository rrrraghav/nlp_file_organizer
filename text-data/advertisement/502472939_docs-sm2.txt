Prove CAMEL
MILDNESS
for Yourself!

Prove for yourself what
throat specialists reported
when 80-day smoking test revealed
NO THROAT IRRITATION
due to smoking CAMELS

TAKE YOUR OWN “DAY-CAMEL” TEST!
Most smokers say, "Camels are too strong!"
They smoke one Camel, then another just to see
if it’s milder. They smoke two, three, even four
Camels and still insist they're too strong! Then we said,
"We’ll prove it!” We picked 80 throat specialists
and asked them to smoke Camels for 80 days.
Smoking Camels—and only Camels—for periods of 16
hours a day. They reported their findings.

The result? It was so startling we couldn't believe it!
smoking Camels caused NO THROAT IRRITATION!
(See panel on right.) So, if you don’t smoke – or
if you do smoke—it’s YOUR CHANCE to give
Camels a fair test. You’ll find they give the
good amount of taste and satisfaction.

Morley-Goodman Guarantee:
The Camels we sent to those specialists were all
manufactured at our own factories. And we guarantee
that every Camel you smoke will be just as mild.
If it isn't, we want you to send us the package.

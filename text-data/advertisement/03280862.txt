If it wasn’t for Winston
I wouldn't smoke.

Taste isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.
I smoke for pleasure. That’s spelled T-A-S-T-E.
That means Winston won’t give you a new image.
All Winston will ever give me is taste.
A taste that's very real. If a cigarette isn’t real,
it isn’t anything. Winston is for real.

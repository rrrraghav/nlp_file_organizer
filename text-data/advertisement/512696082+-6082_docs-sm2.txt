SECONDHAND SMOKE:

HOW MUCH ARE NON-SMOKERS EXPOSED TO?

With all the discussion today about secondhand smoke, you may be interested in how much non-smokers are exposed to.

The answer, in our opinion, is very little. Expressing exposure to secondhand smoke in terms of cigarette equivalents is one way to gain a perspective. For example:

1) A non-smoker living with a smoker would, on the average, be exposed to secondhand smoke equivalent to approximately 1/2 cigarette*.

2) A non-smoker, a non-smoking waiter who works eight hours a day, five days a week in a restaurant would, on the average, be exposed to secondhand smoke equivalent to smoking about 2 cigarettes*.

3) A non-smoker in a room where smokers are present would, on the average, be exposed to with a smoker would, on the average, be exposed to approximately 1/4 cigarette*.

There are many ways to calculate cigarette equivalents and no method exactly predicts the actual amount of secondhand smoke a non-smoker is exposed to.

Also, equivalent calculations are not necessarily relevant in an assessment of the potential risk from secondhand smoke.

In our opinion, secondhand smoke is not the same as the smoke a smoker inhales.

What we mean by this is that there are always two sides to every argument. Both sides need to be heard and evaluated in order to make an informed decision.

We believe that most smoking issues can be found in communication. There are ways for smokers and non-smokers to co-exist peacefully, but it requires a willingness to listen and understand the other side’s point of view. 

As it relates to smokers, in our opinion, the choice to smoke should be made only by adults.

We believe that an informed debate is essential of an informed debate by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for further information please call (800) 366-9444.

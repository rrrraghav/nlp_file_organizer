For me it’s low tar,
not low taste.

Most low tar cigarettes are a tasteless version
of something else. Not Winston Lights.
Winston Lights have low tar. But they also have
taste. If you're sacrificing taste for low
numbers, you're smoking the wrong cigarette.



Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined
That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.

Winston Lights. Winston Light 100’s

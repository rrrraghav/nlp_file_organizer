“With a cigarette as good
as CAMEL, it's swell to
get those extra puffs!”

-HARRY LLOYD,
FAMOUS PAPER DIME TEST PILOT

Be cause 37% more tobacco
is packed into every Camel
than other cigarettes, you get
more smoke per puff. More
satisfaction. More pleasure.

SMOKES

CAMEL
(A picture of a camel)

1.  Camels give you an extra
    puff of smoke—a full, rich,
    satisfying puff.
2.  Camels are made with the
    finest Turkish and Domestic
    tobaccos, expertly blended.
3.  Camels are milder—cooler—
    and freer from irritants than
    any cigarette you’ve ever
    smoked.

EXTRA SMOKES mean extra enjoyment. Extra satisfaction. Camels give you more of both. Try them! You'll agree they're the greatest cigarettes in the world.

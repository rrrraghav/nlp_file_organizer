BUY-LINES • by Nancy Sasser

A Weekly Advertising Column of Things We’ve Heard

Pick. 1/28/49

NEW YORK, N. Y., Jan. 27—The weekly “Buy-Lines” column is a little late this week, partly because of a TV party, weekly
and partly because the Chevrolet people are giving us a headache.

But Chevrolet isn’t alone. All advertisers are around
us, trying to get their message across. The Chevrolet
people are so anxious that they want to make sure you
know all about their new Chevrolets. They want you to
know that they're the best in the business. They want
you to know that they’re giving you a better value for
your money.

Imagine a furiously homeward-bound Chicago man, his
car stalled on a lonely road, miles from anywhere. He
is desperate. He is cold. He is hungry. He is scared.
He begins to imagine all the terrible things that might
happen to him. He imagines himself being eaten by wild
animals. He imagines himself freezing to death. He im-
agines himself starving to death.

“I wish I had a Chevrolet,” he says to himself. “If I
had a Chevrolet, I wouldn’t be in this mess.”

He wishes he had a Chevrolet so badly that he is will-
ing to do anything to get one. He is willing to give up
everything he has. He is willing to sell his soul to the
devil to get one.

“I wish I had a Chevrolet,” he says again. “If I had a
Chevrolet, I wouldn’t be in this mess.”

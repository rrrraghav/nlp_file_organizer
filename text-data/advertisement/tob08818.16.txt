Kids Make Tough
Choices Every Day

A Parent’s Guide
To Helping Them Make
The Right Ones

Kids face a lot of tough decisions while growing up. Studies show
that a major factor in the choices they make is peer pressure. Pressure
from friends and classmates can lead to bad decisions.

You can help them make good decisions through open and frank
talk about the tough issues they face, by showing interest in their
activities and by listening with respect to their views.

Talk to your teens about smoking and other tough issues. Because
the tobacco industry doesn’t want young people to smoke, it brought
together a group of educators to form the Family COURSE Consortium
for advice on programs to help parents talk to their kids. The industry,¹
working with the Consortium, is offering a free booklet to help parents
give their children the tools they need to cope with peer pressure. Write
today for your free copy of “Helping Youth Say No,” or call
toll free, 1-800-342-9099. And look for displays wherever
cigarettes are sold.

Smoking should not be a part of growing up.

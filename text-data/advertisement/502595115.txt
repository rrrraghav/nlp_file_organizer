WILLIAMS OF PORTLAND.
"I’ve been smoking CAMELS for
twenty years, and they are the only
cigarette I ever smoked that didn’t
bother my throat.” — Williams of
Portland, Me.

A WOMAN’S VIEW.
“CAMELS are mild enough to be
enjoyed by women who smoke. They
are not too strong, nor do they leave
a harsh aftertaste.” — Mrs. Mary
E. Smith, New York City.

LISTEN TO THIS!
"I am a smoker and I know that
CAMELS are the best cigarettes made.
They are mild, yet full of flavor."
— J. B. McTavish, Seattle, Wash.



A RECKONING WITH CAMELS.
“I’ve tried other brands, but I always
come back to CAMELS. They satisfy
me more than any other cigarette.”
— W. H. Stauffer, Philadelphia, Pa.

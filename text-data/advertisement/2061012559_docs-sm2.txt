THE THEATRE

New Plays in Manhattan

The new play “The Dark Room” by James Thurber & Elliott Mason, produced by Howard Nelson, at the Music Box Theatre, is simply a delightful comedy. It’s about a man who is trying to write a novel and his wife, who is trying to get him to stop. The dialogue is witty, the situations are funny, and the acting is superb. Miss Margo imparts a great deal of charm in her role as the exasperated wife. Mr. Thurber is excellent as the writer. The play is skillfully directed by Howard Nelson.

James Thurber’s “The Dark Room” is a comedy about a man who has lost his sense of humor. He feels that he must feed on good conversation, but he finds it impossible to get any. 

He is married and has a young wife. She tries to make him laugh, but he is impervious to her efforts. He is so serious that he even takes football games & minor league baseball seriously. His wife decides to take drastic action. She hires a man to pretend to be a burglar in their home. The idea is to frighten him and restore his sense of humor.

The play is very funny, but it also has a touch of sadness. It’s about the importance of laughter and the dangers of taking life too seriously.

That tired feeling may be a sign
that you need iron. Many people,
men and women, are low in iron.
Iron is essential for energy—for
carrying oxygen to all parts of your
body. If you’re tired, weak, or
feel listless, ask your doctor about
iron. He will tell you if a diet con-
taining more iron foods will help.
He may also recommend the taking
of an iron tonic to supplement your
diet. Get back that pep and vim!

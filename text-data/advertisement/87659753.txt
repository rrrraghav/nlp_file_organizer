You don’t start with True.
You change to True.

You’ve changed. Your life style has changed. And so has
your attitude towards smoking. You’ve decided you should
change to a low tar and nicotine cigarette. That brings
many people to True.

U.S. Gov't tests show True is lower in both tar and
nicotine than 98% of all other cigarettes sold. That means
True is not only gentle on your taste, it’s gentle on your
mind.



Regular or Menthol.




Shouldn’t your next cigarette be True?

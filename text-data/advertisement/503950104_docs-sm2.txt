ALL RIGHT MEN!
THIS IS A BOMBING TEST!
GET READY!

RIGHT ON!
THE COMMANDER
IS WATCHING!

PLEASE DON’T
MAKE ME PULL
OUT THIS GUN!

I KNOW YOU'RE
TRYING YOUR BEST!
BUT I CAN’T LET
YOU GET AWAY WITH
THAT, SON!

SOMEBODY’S GOT
TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THESE BOYS!

“THANKFUL TO BE
ALIVE AFTER THAT
BOMBING RUN!”
SAID A PILOT.
“I SHOULD HAVE
SMOKED A CAMEL!”

IF YOU THINK
YOU'VE SEEN A WRECK,
THINK AGAIN!
THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN
YOU DON’T SMOKE
A CAMEL!

LOOKING OUT AT THE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION, HE SAID: “THAT WAS CLOSE! I SHOULD HAVE
HAD A CAMEL!”

IN THE NAVY and MARINE CORPS

WE KNOW HOW TO HANDLE
OUR EQUIPMENT.

ACTUAL SALES RECORDS IN SHIPS
AND MARINE BARRACKS PROVE THAT
CAMELS ARE THE LARGEST-SELLING CIGARETTE

“THANKFUL TO BE
ALIVE AFTER THAT
BOMBING RUN!”
SAID A PILOT.
“I SHOULD HAVE
SMOKED A CAMEL!”

THE SMOKE OF SLOWER-BURNING CAMELS GIVES YOU
EXTRA MILDNESS, EXTRA COOLNESS, EXTRA FLAVOR AND

28% Less Nicotine

THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE OTHER LARGE-SELLING CIGARETTES TESTED—LESS THAN
ANY OF THEM—ACCORDING TO INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC TESTS OF THE SMOKE ITSELF!

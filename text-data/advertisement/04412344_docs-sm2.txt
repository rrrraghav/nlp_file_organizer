Another development from
Lorillard Research:

Kent’s “Micronite” filter
reduces phenol, as well as
tars and nicotine
in cigarette smoke

Lorillard Research scientists, constantly probing ways to
improve the filtering action of the “Micronite” filter, have
incorporated into the filter an additive that selectively
reduces by 54% the phenol in the smoke of a Kent cigaret-
te. This is in addition to Kent’s tar and nicotine reduction.

Developments like this are why we say: “F. Lorillard Company is
first with the finest filter cigarettes through Lorillard Research.”

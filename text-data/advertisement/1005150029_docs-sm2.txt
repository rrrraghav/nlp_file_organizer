If you think flavor went out when filters came in—

try Marlboro

—the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste

If you think flavor went out when filters came in, you’ve got another smoke coming. A Marlboro is made like this: We start with the same fine tobacco receiving special attention. Then we add a filter. But we might as well draw a blank.

It's the tobacco that counts. And it’s the kind of tobacco that makes smoking easy drawing, satisfying.

A Marlboro is a good smoke because the comfort comes from the taste. Because Marlboro’s rich tobacco flavor is absolutely unmingled.

Make yourself
comfortable —have a Marlboro

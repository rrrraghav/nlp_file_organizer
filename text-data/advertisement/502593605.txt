An odds-on favorite

Good things have a way of making
themselves known in this world,
whether at Longchamps or Saratoga,
or Epsom Downs... And in these
places, where people gather who are
accustomed to rely upon their
own taste and judgment, you will
find Camel the odds-on favorite...

he’ll have a winning way.

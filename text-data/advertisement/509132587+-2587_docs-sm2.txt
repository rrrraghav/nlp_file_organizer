“Vantage is solving
a lot of my problems
about smoking.”

"You see, I really enjoy
smoking. To me it’s a pleasure.
But it was no pleasure hearing
all the things being said against
high-tar cigarettes.

"Of course, I used to kid
myself a lot about giving up the
taste of my old high-tar cigarette
for one of those new low-tar
brands. But every one I tried
left my taste unsatisfied.

“Then someone offered
me a Vantage. Sure I’d read
about them. But I thought they
were like all the others. I was
wrong.

"Vantage was right. It satisfied
like my old brand. Yet it had nearly
half the tar.”

“It's been
about a year
since I started
smoking
Vantage. And it
looks like I’m
going to be smoking
them for a long time
to come!”

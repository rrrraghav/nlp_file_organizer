SEASON'S GREETINGS

Camels

Cigars have been an important part of the Christmas celebration for many years. They are associated with good cheer and merriment, and in these days of modern progress, they are as much a necessity as a pipe or a cigar.  EVERYONE appreciates the smoky fragrance of a fine cigar, especially at this time of year when the cold winds blow and the snow is deep.  The enjoyment of a good cigar is one of the simple pleasures in life, and we offer you our best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

A pleasant way to spend the holidays is to enjoy a Camel cigar with friends. 
“It’s a real smoke.”

Prince Albert

Few things are as closely associated with Christmas as the traditional pipe or cigar.  The aroma of good tobacco has always been welcome and hearty, especially at this time of year.  Prince Albert “The Original Blend” is so popular that it is known throughout the world as the standard of excellence in smoking tobaccos.  It’s a gift that will be appreciated by all who enjoy a pipe or cigar. "Merry Christmas!"

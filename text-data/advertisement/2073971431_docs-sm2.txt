ACTION Preventing youth access to cigarettes.

ACCESS

In June of last year, Philip Morris U.S.A. introduced Action Against Access: a comprehensive voluntary program to help prevent underage smoking. Since then, we’ve made significant progress toward our goal of implementing all of these initiatives. And we stand ready to work with retailers and law enforcement officials.

What Philip Morris promised to do:

ACCESS is also helping us continue to work to reach our goal of preventing youth access to cigarettes.

What Philip Morris has done:

IMPLENENTED
In January 2004, we began a nationwide program to help the more than 150,000 retailers across the country who sell cigarettes have the resources they need to comply with all state and federal laws regarding sales to minors. This includes providing them with educational materials, signage, and training.

IMPLENENTED
We’ve developed a “Retailer Compliance Guide” that clearly outlines what retailers must do to prevent underage access. It is available in English and Spanish.

IMPLENENTED
We’ve created a toll-free hotline (1-800-922-4653) for retailers to call with questions or concerns about complying with laws regarding sales to minors.

IMPLENENTED
We’ve launched an aggressive campaign to educate retailers about the importance of preventing underage access and the consequences of illegal sales.

IMPLENENTED
We've provided more than 270,000 retailers with compliance guides, signage, and other materials.

We are proactively supporting during the 2004 state legislative sessions in states where we do business, through a combination of direct lobbying efforts and support for organizations working to prevent underage smoking. We’re also providing financial assistance to help fund youth prevention programs and research into the causes of underage smoking.

The best way to keep kids away from cigarettes is to keep cigarette away from kids.

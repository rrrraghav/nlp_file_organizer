SMOKING SHOULD NOT BE
A PART OF GROWING UP

Educators strive to provide children with
the tools to make the right choices. In today's
complex society, growing up involves facing
more pressures and choices than ever before.
Studies show that young people do some things
because their friends do. Smoking is one of
those things.

We don’t want young people to smoke.
That’s why The Tobacco Institute brought
together a group of educators to form the
Family COURSE Consortium. Together,
the industry and the
Consortium are
offering materials

aimed at helping adults provide children with
the tools to resist peer pressure. The booklet,
"Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No," is designed to
stimulate communication about important issues
like smoking.

As an educator, you have the opportunity to
provide your students with information to assist
them in making wise decisions. Join us in our
commitment that smoking should not be a part
of growing up. Return the coupon

Helping Youth Say No," or call toll

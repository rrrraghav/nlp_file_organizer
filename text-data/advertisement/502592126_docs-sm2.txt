Camel

YOU put a customer set on buying Camels—
and you’ve done something that will bring
you quick returns!  Tell him about the
flavor that keeps a man in Camels for a life-
time. Tell him about the satisfaction, the
Sticker for his convenience and satisfaction.
The Camel sticker is an advertising tool
that brings customers—and money—making sales
every day!

1.  He’s got the speed! He's got the daring!
    He’s got the brains to use ‘em! This is George Cole,
    the fleet-footed wonder of the St. Louis Browns.
    He steals bases with a confidence that makes
    opposing pitchers sweat and opposing fielders
    worry. And he hits!

2.  “I always try to take an extra base,” says George.
    “Sometimes I make it, sometimes I don’t. But
    I figure the worst thing that can happen is I get
    out. Then I go back and try again.”

3.  That's the spirit! That’s the kind of spirit that
    makes baseball thrilling! And George Cole has it!

4.  “I smoke Camels,” says George, “because they’re
    mild. They don’t bite my tongue. I can smoke ‘em
    all day long without getting nervous.”

“When I switched to Vantage,
I didn’t get nearly as much
grief from my husband.”

"What happens when
you like to smoke but the
person who's squawking is
your husband? Well, if you
care, you listen. And you
start asking questions."

“The things I kept
hearing about tar… high tar
didn’t sound pleasant.
But most of those low-tar
cigarettes gave
me nothing but
lip exercise.”

"Some
friends I knew
smoked Vantage. So I
tried one. They had the flavor!
Like almost as good as my old brand.
But with a lot less tar."

“How do I feel about Vantage? I think
they’re terrific.”

"My husband
and I still talk
about smoking.
But now we talk
about lots of
other things as
well."

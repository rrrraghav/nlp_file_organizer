Office Hours - 24 hours a day

BATTLE CREEK—At home, Dr. J. B.
Hale says he is working on a new
theory of the universe. These days
he spends all his time in his study,
and with the electricity bill so high
it’s hard to keep him from going mad.
“I am trying to find out what makes
the world go round,” he said. “And I
am getting closer every day.”

Office Hours—24 hours a day
is the way Dr. Hale puts it, and
he did not mention that his profession
is that of a physician. He is one
of those men who are so absorbed in
their work that they forget to eat or
sleep, and he is so interested in what
he is doing that he doesn’t care if the
world ends.

We think every man has the right
to work as many hours as he pleases,
but we also think that a man ought
to take time out to enjoy himself.
Dr. Hale seems to have forgotten all
about enjoying himself.

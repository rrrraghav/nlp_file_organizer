NON SMOKERS

SPEAK UP NOW FOR YOUR RIGHT TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR

Are you sick and tired of being forced to breathe other people's tobacco smoke? Other non smokers are also, and they are beginning to speak out and get results.

Use these signs, buttons, and stickers to tell friends, neighbors, co-workers and others that you would rather not breathe their smoke, and watch them cooperate.

Help spread the word that the silent majority will be silent no longer!

PLEASE
NO SMOKING

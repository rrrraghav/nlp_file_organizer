FASTEST BASE RUNNER IN BASEBALL

28

YOU SEE THE FLASH OF SPEED, the blur of a man
who can steal a base before you can blink! That’s one
of the reasons why George Case is considered one of
baseball's greatest. But he isn’t just speed—he’s also
a powerful hitter who drives those long balls out of the
park. He’s a real major leaguer, every inch!

Heat-footed George Case... leading
base-stealer of the major leagues...
SMOKES THE SLOWER-BURNING
CIGARETTE—CAMEL

SAVE ADMIRATION! SAVE TIME! SAVE
COST OF CONTINUED
CITY STOMACH ACHE!
TRY CAMELS!

George Case tells us: “I like Camels because they’re mild, yet give me a satisfying smoke. I can smoke ‘em all day and not feel that nervous tension.”

That's the secret of Camel’s slower-burning quality—a quality that makes smoking Camels a pleasure rather than a chore! They’re made of choice Turkish and Domestic tobaccos... expertly blended, naturally aged.

Camels are milder—cooler—more satisfying!
They don’t bite or irritate your throat. Try them! You'll agree they’re the finest cigarettes you ever smoked!

SPEED COUNTS IN BASEBALL AS WELL AS IN A CIGARETTE. SLOW-
BURNING CAMELS GIVE
YOU MORE SMOKES—MORE
EXTRA PLEASURE TOO!

OF THE STARS: George Case (above, right) prefers a slower pace... he likes
to savor his smoke. He says Camels are the only cigarettes that give him
that extra enjoyment. Try Camel’s new, extra-mildness. You'll like them too!

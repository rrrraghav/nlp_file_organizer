“SOME WHAT? I
CAN’T HEAR YOU!”

“I SAID, WE’RE
MAKING A PLAN
FOR THE NERVE SYSTEM”

“RIGHT! OKAY!
WE’LL CALL IT ‘OPERATION
HEADQUARTERS!’”

“OKAY! NOW
HEADQUARTERS!”

“YES SIR! I MEAN
TAKE ME TO CAPTAIN

HE'S THE GRAND

USE IT!

AND WE’LL CALL THIS
OPERATION ‘HEADQUARTERS!’
SO THE LIEUTENANT KNOWS
WHAT'S WHAT!

WALKIE TALKIE, two-way
radio communication for
field operations.  It helps
keep things moving with
speed and precision.

“I GOT IT!”

“AND I’M GOING TO

(A GREAT WAY
TO KEEP IN TOUCH)

GAS!”

CAMELS 
GIVE YOU THE
ALL-ROUND
LINE. THE FLAVOR
IS GRAND, AND
THEY'RE MILDER!

IN THE ARMY

COAST GUARD
CALLS THEM
THE FINEST
CIGARETTE

AND I’M GOING TO
MAKE IT SO BIG THAT
ALL SHIPS
CAN USE IT!

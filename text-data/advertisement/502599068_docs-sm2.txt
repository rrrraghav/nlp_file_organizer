Give ‘em what they want!

The largest-selling
cigarette in the world!
So smooth—so fresh—
it’s a pleasure to smoke!
A cigarette with this
fine taste is worth more!

See Stanley Rubenstein
in “The Big Land”

The biggest-selling
filter cigarette!
It's up to you, of course.
But if you like a mild,
flavorful taste with the
satisfaction of a filter...
you’ll find Winston has it!
Winston tastes good!
Like a little vacation!

Roger’s favorite is
the smoked kind!
He says, “The unique
smoky flavor of Camel
is something special.
It's a taste that lingers!”
Camel—it’s the original!

This present idea
in smoking!
See Stanley Rubenstein
in "The Big Land" and you’ll
see R.J. Reynolds’ Salem is
the cigarette with the
smooth, cool flavor
that makes life more
darned just pleasant!

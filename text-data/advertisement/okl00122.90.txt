IT’S THE LAW

WE DO NOT SELL
TOBACCO PRODUCTS
TO PERSONS UNDER 18

The tobacco industry is committed to seeing this sign prominently displayed throughout the nation wherever cigarettes are sold.
We want our products in the hands of young people. We never have. It's the law.
Using storefront, window and point-of-purchase displays, this sign will help you demonstrate that you comply with laws prohibiting sales to minors. Tips to help employees verify age and deal with customers are also available for your use.

Working with national, state and local groups, the tobacco industry is committed to seeing these signs displayed wherever cigarettes are sold. To learn more about “It’s The Law,” please fill out this coupon today. We'll send you the materials you need to get this program in your establishment.

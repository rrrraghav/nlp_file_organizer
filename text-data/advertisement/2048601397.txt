Common courtesy
is common sense.

Many people enjoy smoking. To others, tobacco smoke is annoying. We all know that smoking is a risk factor for certain diseases,
and smoke in a room may have a harmful
effect on some young children.

When it comes to smoking, we believe it’s
important to respect the wishes of others. To
accommodate everyone's right to choose,

a solution is:
1. Establish specific smoking and
non-smoking areas in the workplace and
public places.
2. Maintain proper ventilation, especially
in areas where smoking is permitted.
3. Provide common courtesy to the wishes
of others.

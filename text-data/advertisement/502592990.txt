Camel is the understanding smoke

HAVE
A CAMEL

Camel is the understanding smoke
CAMEL is a cigarette that’s
different. It's made of a special
blend of Turkish and Domestic
tobacco. Right from the start, you
know it’s different—the way it looks,
the way Camel smells, the way
it burns so evenly. And when you
smokes one, you know that it is
different. It gives you a cool,
satisfying smoke that no other
cigarette can give you.

It's the distinguishing mark of
a man who knows what he wants.
A man who appreciates quality.
A man who doesn’t have to be told
that Camel is the cigarette that
suits him best. A man who says,
"I smoke Camels because they suit
me." That is why every
Camel smoker is a loyal Camel
smoker. And they're very happy
to tell you how much better Camels
are than any other cigarette.

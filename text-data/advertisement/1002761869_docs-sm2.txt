Why don’t you settle back
and have a full-flavored smoke?

Marlboro



with the unfiltered taste
the filter cigarette

This is the difference—Marlboro smoking
with the filter gives you a satisfying
mildness, without sacrificing flavor. It gives
you something to savor. And makes natural
smokers feel like…

You get a lot for life-
time pack or box.

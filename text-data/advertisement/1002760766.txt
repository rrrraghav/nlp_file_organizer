Messages From Mars

It started at 9:30 p.m., Chateau time,
or 7:30 p.m. EST. It lasted for minutes
but it was enough. The first message came
from Villard, in the area of Valparaíso of
Chile. Then followed others from various
European stations. All over Chile
the messages were received.

The Martian transmission, as the
radio listeners have named them, began
with a series of clicks and whistles. It
was then that the first message came up.
It was clear in English. The message
came from Mars. It said: “We are here.”
Then it went on to say that they were
coming to Earth. They did not mention
the date. Many in the United States
and Canada heard the messages.

Indeed, fully a million people listened
to the Martian transmission. The first
message was received by a young man
named William R. Stander of New York.
He is a radio engineer for the Columbia
Broadcasting System. Stander was working
late at his desk in the CBS studios when
he heard the message. He immediately
notified his superiors. They were as
astonished as he was.

The messages have been received by
radio stations all over the world. The
British Broadcasting Corporation has
received them. So has the Radio Moscow.
So has the NHK in Japan. It is said that
the messages are being translated into
many languages.

WORRY ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?
I DON’T!

I KNOW I CAN DEPEND ON CAMELS FOR A SMOKINGLY GOOD TASTE!

I AM PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE MILLIONS WHO ENJOY CAMELS' UNIQUE BLEND OF FINE TURKISH AND DOMESTIC TOBACCOS, GROWN AND CURRED IN SUN-DRENCHED FIELDS.

IT’S A SINGLE MILDER, MORE FLAVORFUL CIGARETTE!

I LIKE IT!

YES... THE 30-DAY TEST PROVED CAMELS' SUPERIOR WILDNESS
FLAVOR!
YOU ME!

THEY’RE SO COOL AND EASY TO SMOKE! THEY SATISFY MY TASTE FOR A MILDER, MORE FLAVORFUL CIGARETTE.

I LIKE THE WAY CAMELS MAKE ME FEEL!

Peer pressure,
shmeer pressure.

Don’t smoke.

If some of your friends smoke, and they make you feel like
you should smoke, too, that's "peer pressure."
But even though we’re a cigarette company, we think young
people shouldn’t smoke. Even the decision to smoke or not to smoke should
wait until you’re an adult.
So we put together these ideas to help you recognize peer
pressure—and resist it.

Tactic #1: Go ahead and take a puff—what's the matter, are you chicken?
Answer: You must think I’m pretty dumb to fall for that one. It takes a
lot more guts to do your own thing than to just go along with
the crowd.

Tactic #2: Come on, all the cool kids smoke.
Answer: Maybe the kids who smoke are trying to look cool. But if they
really were cool, maybe they wouldn’t have to try so hard.

Tactic #3: Hey, I'm your friend—would I steer you wrong?
Answer: Friends are people who like you for who you are, not for what
they want you to be. If you’re really my friend, back off.

Tactic #4: Do you want everybody to think you’re a nerd?
Answer: Sure I care what other kids think of me. But if they base their
opinions on stuff like smoking, their opinions aren't worth
much.

Tactic #5: I bet you’re just scared your parents will find out.
Answer: I wouldn’t blame my parents for getting teed off. How can I
expect them to treat me like an adult if I sneak around and act
like a kid?

It's natural for you to want to be just like your friends.
But if you don’t smoke, maybe your friends will want
to be just like you.

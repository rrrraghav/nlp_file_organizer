Doesn’t Want Kids
To Smoke

One of the most trying aspects of being a parent is encouraging your child to make responsible decisions in today's complex society, growing up involves making choices that can have lasting effects. Studies show that young people do things because they feel pressured or want to be like their older things. Smoking is one of those things.

At Philip Morris U.S.A., we believe that children and teenagers should not want to smoke. We’re supporting efforts to provide a booklet aimed at helping parents meet the challenge of talking with their children about the tools to resist peer influence. The booklet, “Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No,” is designed to keep parents and children communicating about important issues like smoking.

It's continue its longstanding commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, the tobacco industry has strengthened its support for legislation to make it tougher for young people to get cigarettes. We are working with increased but strict compliance with state laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors.

Voluntary Initiatives of
a Responsible Industry

In Advertising

• In 1954, to meet public demand, the industry
began to advertise low tar and nicotine cigarettes.
• In 1960, when the Federal Trade Commission
said such advertising could be construed as a health
claim, the industry agreed to eliminate references
to tar and nicotine from advertising (The FTC re-
versed this position in 1966.)
• In 1966, the industry began a continuing pro-
gram of scientific and technical cooperation with the
FTC in the Commission’s tar and nicotine testing.
• In 1970, under an agreement reached with the
FTC, the industry began to include in all brand adver-
tising FTC tar and nicotine measurements.
• In 1971, the companies began voluntarily to de-
pict the cigarette package in brand advertising so
as to show legibly the warning label.
• In 1972, they agreed with the FTC on uniform
terms of displaying the warning label in advertising.
• In 1981, the industry reached agreement with
the FTC to increase the size of the warnings.

On Youth Smoking

Additional voluntary initiatives of the industry rein-
force its position that smoking is an adult custom
to be considered only by those mature enough to
make an informed decision.
• In 1963, cigarette companies stopped all adver-
tising and promotional activities in school and col-
lege publications and on campuses.
• In 1964, the industry adopted a cigarette adver-
tising code prohibiting advertising, marketing and
sampling directed at young people and the use of
celebrities and sports figures in ads. All companies
continue to observe the principles of this code.
• In 1969, the industry offered to radio and
television advertising because of its substantial au-
dience of young people. As a result, in 1971, pur-
suant to federal legislation, cigarette advertising left
the airways.

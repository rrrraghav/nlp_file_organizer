"I AM ONE OF THE MILLIONS WHO
PREFER CAMELS" SAYS RALPH GREENLEAF
WORLD'S CHAMPION IN POCKET BILLIARDS

“HEALTHY NERVES ARE A MUST WITH ME!”

“You know,” says Ralph Greenleaf, “a man has got to be steady. I can’t afford to be nervous. In pool, a shaky hand means losing money—and I’ve got to win! That's why I smoke Camels. They keep my nerves calm and steady. I tried other cigarettes, but they just didn’t do the trick. Now, with a Camel, I can put all my concentration into the game.”

And America has a million others who prefer Camels!

The reason? Because Camel experts know that
Ralph Greenleaf is right—Camels are different.
Camel's choice Turkish and Domestic leaf tobaccos
are cured, fermented and aged. This process
gives Camels a distinctive smoothness and body
that no other cigarette can match.



That was the secret of the Highborn strain horses—careful breeding and aging. It’s the same with Camel tobacco.

JAMES E. CLARE, another world-famous pool champion, says: “I smoke Camels because they're mild and satisfying. They don’t upset my nerves.”

Winston
the extraordinary
fine cigarette




They didn’t take college smokers long to find out that Winston tastes
good. They found it in the rich, full-bodied flavor – a taste that's
real tobacco flavor, rich and full. That’s why the Winston crowd doesn’t
want any other cigarette. Try Winstons - you’ll see!

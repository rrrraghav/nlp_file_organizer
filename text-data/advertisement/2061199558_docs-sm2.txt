Race your Cigarettes!

You’ll still keep a fresh, cool mouth.
If you keep to SPUDs

Do you smoke one after another... just feeling snug and looking? There's a good time here—Spud-type zest!

How does Spud do it?

There’s nothing mysterious about the coolness in a Spud. It’s the result of a special menthol treatment…a treatment not applied to the ordinary cigarette. This menthol is blended with the tobacco... then, and only then, are the cigarettes rolled. The Spuds give an immediate freshness—a cool, clean taste that lingers.

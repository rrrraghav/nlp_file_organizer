Introducing Fact.

The low gas, low ‘tar’.

 Chances are you’ve never heard gas and cigarettes mentioned
 together before. Just ‘tar’ and nicotine.
 According to some critics of smoking, gases are part of the
 controversy too.
 You see, smoke is mostly gas. Different kinds of gas. And despite
 what we tobacco people think, these critics say it’s just as important to
 cut down on some of the gases as it is to lower ‘tar’ and nicotine.
 No ordinary cigarette can do it. But Fact can.
 Fact is unique, the first cigarette with a revolutionary Purifie filter.
 And Fact reduces gas concentrations at the same time it reduces ‘tar’
 and nicotine. 
 Meaning you get low gas and low ‘tar’. Together.
 But that's not all.
 Take a minute to read our pack. It tells you
 how Purifie makes this the first low ‘tar’ smoke
 with good, rich taste.

 Taste as good as the leading
 king-size brand.

 And that’s a Fact.

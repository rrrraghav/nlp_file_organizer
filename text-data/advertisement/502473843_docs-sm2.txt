Test CAMELS
for 30 days
for MILDNESS
and FLAVOR

More People Smoke CAMELS than any other cigarette.

THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY
CAMEL’S distinctive taste appeals
to more smokers—yes, more smokers
than all other brands combined!
It's not just that Camels are milder.
Camels have a special smoothness, full
bodied flavor that satisfies. Try Camels
for 30 days. You’ll agree they are
the most thoroughly enjoyable cigarette
you ever smoked!

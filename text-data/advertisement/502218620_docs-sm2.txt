WINSTON!

PURE white filter-
CLEAN fresh flavor

The Winston mystery, more than any cigarette,
is the mystery of its taste. It’s a startlingly good
taste—a full, rich, satisfying taste that comes
from a special blend of fine tobaccos. A taste
that's mellowed and sweetened by our unique
triple-scouring process. Winston is so clean,
so fresh, it seems to almost disappear. It’s
about time you tried a WINSTON! See how much
better a cigarette can taste!

Winston TASTES GOOD like a cigarette should!

IT’S THE
LAW

WE DO NOT SELL
TOBACCO PRODUCTS
TO PERSONS UNDER 18



The tobacco industry is committed to seeing this sign
prominently displayed throughout the nation wherever
tobacco products are sold.

Why? Very simply, we do not want our products in the
hands of minors. We believe it’s the right thing to do.
Using storefront window and point-of-purchase
displays, retailers can help comply with state laws that
state have prohibiting tobacco sales to minors. Label builders



and tips to help store employees verify age and deal with
customers are fact sheets available for your use.
The tobacco institute’s goal is to have this signage displayed
nationwide. We will provide the material
when the coupon today. We'll send you the return
mail coupon for your convenience.

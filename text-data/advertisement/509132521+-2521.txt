Is there an answer
to the
smoking question?

Should people smoke? They've been banned but quit over the smoking
question, and now they want to know if there is another
answer. And the critics of smoking think they have all the answers.
But what do smokers think? Should people be allowed to smoke or going
to continue to be harassed for doing so? What should a smoker
smoke? 

Smokers always want you to give up smokless but non-smokers con-
cerned about “tar” and nicotine, don’t they recommend that
you switch to something less harmful like Vantage?

Some smokers say that the taste of tar and nicotine methanol
could suggest that they switch too low ‘tar’ and nicotine methanol. Like
Vantage.

Vantage Methanol offers smokers all the cool, refreshing
taste of a cigarette plus it reduces “tar” and nicotine.
Then the subliminal gets in: “tar” and nicotine.

The taste of tar and nicotine is so good
and nicotine methanol around. But startling
low ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarettes are still there.

Sell you smokeless methanol-cigarettes, why
don't you just switch to something better? You
shouldn’t. It fast is you do.

And if you want to know something about “tar”
and nicotine, Vantage Methanol could
be the answer for you to consider.

Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined
That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.

METHOL

WARNING: We war-
rant that it gives
you no more ‘tar’
or nicotine. 723

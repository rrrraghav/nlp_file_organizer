HERE’S A LESSON IN

How to Die!

(And how to avoid it.)

EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER

I learned
that smoking
is dangerous
by experience.

That's why
I smoke Camels
now.

Let your taste tell you why More people are smoking

CAMELS than ever before!

YOURS FOR THE ASKING

If you’re going to smoke,
smoke a cigarette that’s made of fine,
costly tobacco—a cigarette that’s
mild and refreshing from the very first draw.
A cigarette that doesn't hit back at you.
That’s why I switched to Camels. They are
so much better than any other cigarette
I ever smoked.

-Paul Gallico, Author

According to a Nationwide Survey...

MOST DOCTORS SAY THAT ANY OTHER CIGARETTE

IS MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE THROAT IRRITATION

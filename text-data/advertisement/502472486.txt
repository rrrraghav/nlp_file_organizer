BUDDY BOMAR

BOWLING IN THE CLUTCH!
BLAST ‘EM!

“I’M GONNA HIT THIS ONE SO HARD IT’LL GO RIGHT THROUGH THAT PIN AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE!”

BUDDY'S GOT A LOT OF NERVE, 
BUT HE’S ALSO GOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. 
AND WHEN YOU HAVE BOTH, YOU CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING!

“I’M A STUBBORN
OLD COOT!”

“YES, BUDDY,
YOU ARE!”

"THIS IS THE MATCH
OF YOUR LIFE!"

THEY SAY BOMAR'S GOT MORE NERVE THAN A BUNCH OF CATS IN A DOG FOOD FACTORY. 
AND HE PROBABLY DOES!

“BUDDY BOMAR?
HE’S CRAZY!”

“I KNOW, I KNOW!
BUT HE’S MY PARTNER!”

"THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT
THE GUYS!"

"IT FEELS FINE
TO ME. I THINK
I’LL HAVE TWO
MORE CAMELS WAY!”

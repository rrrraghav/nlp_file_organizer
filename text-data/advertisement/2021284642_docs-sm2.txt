SMOKING SHOULD NOT BE
A PART OF GROWING UP

One of the most trying aspects of being a
parent is encouraging your child to make the right
choices—not just to follow along. Today’s
complex
society,
growing up
involves more
pressures and
choices than
ever before.
Studies show
that young
people do things
because their
friends do.
Smoking is one of
those things.

We don't want
young people to
smoke.

That’s why we are offering a booklet aimed at
helping parents meet the challenge of guiding
their children with the tools to resist peer pressure.
This booklet, Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No®, is

the third in a series designed to keep parents and
children communicating about important issues like
smoking.

To continue its
understanding
commitment that
smoking is not for
young people, the
tobacco industry also
has strengthened
its marketing
code and is
supporting state
legislators to make
it illegal for
young people to
buy cigarettes.
We are also
working with retailers on
strict compliance with state laws prohibiting sales of
cigarettes to minors. Look for this display at
convenience stores and gas stations.

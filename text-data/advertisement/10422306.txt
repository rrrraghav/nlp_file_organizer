Mark and Lois Haroldsen Have … They Want to Help You

Achieve Total Financial Freedom

They’re Not Smarter.
Millions are not so! It
is a fact that millions
are making $10,000 to
$20,000 a year—and
working like crazy
people, working their
fingers to the bone!
No way!

We were two rookies
only 22 and 25 years
old, and certainly no
experts. We had only
$100 between us,
and we didn’t know
much of anything.
My father and another
fellow put up the $100
to buy an insurance
policy—that was all.

We were different, though. I had always
liked to sell, but my wife, Lois, was a real
fireball. She could talk anyone into any-
thing! We sold hard, we worked hard, and
we made it.

When Mark and Lois Haroldsen were 28 and 22 years old re-
spectively they dared to risk their dream. Here is their
remarkable story and how they did it.

All told, we have made $11,000,000 using the
formula.

When you get started, you’ll
find that most people are afraid
to take a chance. They’re afraid
of losing what little they have.
They’re afraid of being different.
They’re afraid of failing.

Anyone Can. You or
anyone else can certainly
do this! It's not because
it is easy, you may still do
this in a year or two. But
definitely this is the open-
ing you’ve been wait-
ing for—the chance to
try our formula will
be:

• Buy insurance proper-
ties at bargain prices
• Build without any
delay
• Then, when your
your pockets reach
a certain depth,
start buying prop-
erties!
• Your assets grow
every year! My-
riads of people
have big incomes at 25.

• Allow yourself to travel
• Have a new car every
year month.
• Then you will find out
that your income is so
great that you can buy
anything you want—and
still have plenty left over!

We started with one policy. Then another.
Then three. Then five. Then ten. Then twen-
ty. Then fifty. Then a hundred. We were
working like crazy people—but we were get-
ting somewhere!

We didn’t know much about insurance, but
we knew how to sell. And that’s what mat-
tered. We sold hard, we worked hard, and
we made it.

Three stories of people confronting their pasts

“Over the long haul she couldn’t have endured [her husband's] collection of books, but now the idea of the books without her is almost unbearable.” – Joan Didion.

Even if Donald seemed nice, the stories don’t all come from a place of pain. Harrison’s still with us. A contender. (Houghton Mifflin; Seymour Lawrence, $19.95) -Leah Race

THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME
by Thomas Maxwell

A tale of the sort that resonates through our culture is what we're dealing with here. In the 60s, rock star J.C. Tripper died at the peak of his popularity under mysterious circumstances. Rumors persist that Tripper faked his own death.

The music business being what it is, the rumors were fueled by Tripper’s manager, a drug-dependent hard hat named Lex, a drug-dependent hard hat. He's protecting his sibling’s legacy. He’s approached by a young man who wants to establish once and for all the truth of J.C.’s final disposition.

This nature of J.C.’s pseudonym writer Thomas Maxwell (who also writes thrillers under his real name, Tom as Griffiths—starts with a John Lee makes for a clever twist) is that he’s amused by a slightly cynical story. He's running the once-Maxwell scene by the bodies dropping.

The only thing Maxwell doesn’t know is that when he’s finished, the subject of his novel, J.C. Tripper, will be alive again.

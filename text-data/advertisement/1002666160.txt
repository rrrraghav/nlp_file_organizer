Answers to the most asked questions about cigarettes.

With these words, The Tobacco Institute will introduce a major national advertising program. It deals specifically with answering community and individual questions about cigarettes: important public information needed during this time.

The series of answers—the messages you see me holding—it will appear in February and March in US News & World Report. Illustrated TV Guides and other publications. The original advertisements will be followed by a series of short films, the first of which is “Weigh Both Sides.” We hope you take the time to view it and think about the issues involving cigarettes.

So we ask that you consider this: before you take sides—before you make up your mind—we want you to send for a new booklet, "Answers to the Most Asked Questions About Cigarettes." This advertisement is our way of calling you—the members of the tobacco family—what you will soon be hearing from us.

We are designed to make this announcement for the whole family and its customers. 
Speak up for the tobacco family and its customers.



Sincerely,

Samuel D. Gillille, Jr.
President, The Tobacco Institute




WEIGH BOTH SIDES
BEFORE YOU TAKE SIDES.

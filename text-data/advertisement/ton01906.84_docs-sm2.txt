THE INCREDIBLE TOBACCO LEAF: IT PAYS ½ BILLION A YEAR IN TAXES FOR US.

It is grown in 23 states, on 1½ million acres, producing an annual harvest of over 600 million pounds.
American tobacco is the world’s most important.
The cost of growing tobacco—seedling, leaf, curing—is about $50 per thousand.
The farmer receives little for his work; the most heavily taxed consumer pays it.
It takes 200 hours of labor to raise a single acre of tobacco. It requires machinery and fertilizer.
To grow, cure, and handle the red-leaf crop covers 11 months of the year.
The average farmer has only 30 acres of tobacco. He must supplement his income with other crops.
It takes an investment of $400 to $600 per acre for seed, fertilizer, and supplies.
Machines harvest an acre in less than two hours; it used to take 20 men 18 hours.
The farmer’s profit is small—about $35 per acre.

Old Bill: “I remember when a man could raise a whole family on tobacco.”
“Now, the taxes are so high that they’re practically stealing from us.”
“It used to be that a man could make a good living for his family and still have something left over.”
“But now, with these taxes, it’s just not possible anymore. It's a sad thing to see.”
“I remember when the price of tobacco was so low that anyone could afford it.”
“Now, it costs so much that only the rich can afford it. It’s a disgrace.”
“The government is taking advantage of us and we can’t do anything about it.”
“It’s just not fair.”

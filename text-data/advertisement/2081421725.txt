FAMOUS COWBOY PICKUP LINES

“Chuck it, I can’t beat that.”
“Howdy, Will Mayo.”
“Appaloosa for D-s.”
The ride is comfortable.
Power up the stereo and
settle in. Friendly. Tough.
Built to do more than 100,000
miles. So drive on. And enjoy
a beauty that’s built to last.
A pickup with character. A
truck that can carry its weight
bumper simply with style.

And find how they've taken
every care to make sure all
that fun—and more—is on
the side of the road. Of
adventure. And life. Find it
in a pickup that’s built

with pride.

With you, your heritage.

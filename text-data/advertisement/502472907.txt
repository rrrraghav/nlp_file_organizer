CAMEL MILDNESS

30-Day test of hundreds of Camel smokers revealed
NO THROAT IRRITATION DUE TO SMOKING CAMELS!

(Not a single case!)

Even so, we sent the reports were
so startling—so convincingly clear—due to smoking Camels!
We asked 100 doctors to make their own
examinations. They tested men and women
who smoked Camels only—for 30
consecutive days.

And then men and women smoked on the
same basis, but who didn’t smoke Camels.
Every one of the 100 polled Camel smokers
proved, in his own “Know-It-To-Be-True”
way, that Camels do not irritate throats!
The doctors said: "Camels are a cigarette
of unusually mildness." And they added:
"We have found nothing to indicate that
Camel smoking will cause any throat
irritation.”

Instant Air Conditioner

Maybe you never thought of a room deodorizer this way. But Lysol Spray does more than cover up odors. It takes them right out of the air. Actually changes the condition of the air. Leaves it fresh, odor-free. 

And because it’s Lysol, it kills germs on surfaces all over the house—germs that cause odors—germs that can make everybody miserable. What ordinary room deodorizer can do all this? Come to think of it, what ordinary air conditioner can?

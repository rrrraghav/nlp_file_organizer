“I like a FRESH cigarette
—don’t you?”



They are made of choice, dark-cured tobacco, which
is naturally sweet and mild.  It's a difference you can
taste.  A difference that makes you want to smoke…and
smoke…and smoke!

Camel experts say this particular blend is so good,
so exceptionally smooth, it’s almost unfair to other
cigarettes.



You’ll find, like thousands of others, that Camels are
different.  That they give you a satisfaction no other
cigarette can equal. 

There's an extra pleasure here—a distinctive flavor
that lingers pleasantly.  A flavor that makes you want
to smoke another Camel…and another!

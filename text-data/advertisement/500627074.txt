Second-hand smoke:
Let’s clear the air.

Can cigarette smoke in the air cause disease in non-smokers?
That’s an emotional question for smokers and non-smokers alike.
So we'll try to set the record straight in the most direct way we know.
There is little evidence—and certainly nothing which proves scientifically—that cigarette smoke causes disease among non-smokers.

You don’t have to take our word for it.
U.S. Surgeon General Julius B. Richmond—who was no friend of smoking—said in his 1979 Report: “Healthy non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no physiologic response to the smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological factors.”

And in the 1982 Report, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop could not conclude that passive smoking is a cause of cancer in non-smokers.

The director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Dr. Claude Lenfant, has been one of the tobacco industry’s sharpest critics. Yet Dr. Lenfant stated in 1980 (and we believe it remains true today) that “the evidence that passive smoking in a general environment has health effects remains sparse, incomplete and sometimes unconvincing.”

We've decided to speak out on passive smoking because there is so much rumor and rhetoric on this subject today. And we intend to continue, from time to time, to speak out on other topics of concern to you and to us.

Our critics may try to discredit these messages as self-serving. In a sense, they will be right. We will challenge allegations that are unproven and attacks we think are unfounded. If that is self-serving, so be it.

The questions that surround smoking raise many important issues. We believe that you’re entitled to hear all sides of these controversies.

Hero—
a hundred times a day!



Ist in the service—

“It’s funny,” says Mr. John R. Mc-
Graw, “how I used to feel when I was
working on the railroad. It seemed like
I was always tired and worn out. My
wife urged me to see a doctor, but I
wouldn't. Then one day I started smok-
ing Camels. They tasted so good—so
smooth—that I felt better right away.
Now, I feel stronger than ever. I can
work harder and longer without getting
tired.”



Mr. McGraw is just one of thousands
of men who tell similar stories. Men who
have found that Camel’s special blend
helps them to keep their spirits up—to
meet the day with a smile—to do more
work—and feel better while doing it.



Thinking of you, we want to show you
how Camels help these men.

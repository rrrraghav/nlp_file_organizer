There is a difference between
other low tar cigarettes and MERIT.
A proven difference.
MERIT Solid Winner.

MERIT delivers the flavor of high tar
cigarettes and continues to satisfy

as—or better than—leading high tar
brands. Even cigarettes having
twice the tar!

96% who stated a preference,
the MERIT low/tar/good taste
combination was favored 3 to 1 over
high tar leaders when tar levels were
revealed!

smokers who have switched to MERIT,
9 out of 10 reported they continue
to enjoy smoking and that MERIT is the
best-tasting low tar they’ve ever tried!
MERIT is the proven alternative to
high tar smoking. And you can taste it.

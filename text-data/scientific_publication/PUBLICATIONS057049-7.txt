The ability of p53 to function as a tumor suppressor is
linked to its function as a transcriptional activator. Cells
respond to stress signals by inducing the expression of
tumor suppressor genes. Previous studies identified an
activation domain in the N-terminal region of p53, 1-60
the proteins to trigger this rapid and several protein
transcription factors, including p300/CBP (Creutz et al.,
example, mdm-2, a cellular oncoprotein. binds to this
domain and represses p53 activity. We describe here two
region of p53 that map between amino acids 1-60. These
describe one activation domain which lies in the amino
terminal region (1-40) and another at codons 40-60.
We show in yeast how these two activation subdomains,
when expressed individually, can activate transcription.
These split activation subdomains 1-40 and 40-60
require the adaptor complex ADA/ADA3/BCS for activity
for transcriptional complexes. We also show that both
subdomains are necessary to induce apoptosis in human
fibroblast cells may regulate gene expression by
inducing chromatin modification.

Introduction
p53 is a transcription factor that is activated in response
to various stress signals, including DNA damage, hypoxia,
and oncogenic transformation (Finlay et al., 1994). The
activation of p53 leads to the induction of genes involved
in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. Mutations
in p53 are found in approximately 50% of human tumors
(Levine et al., 1994), making it the most frequently mutated
gene in cancer.

p53 functions as a transcriptional repressor as well as
an activator (el-Deiry et al., 1994; Nakano et al., 1994).
As a transcriptional activator, p53 recruits coactivators
such as p300/CBP to gene promoters (Ogryzek et al., 1994;
Washbrook et al., 1994). p300/CBP is a histone acetyl-
transferase that stimulates transcription by relaxing
chromatin structure.

The N-terminal domain of p53 (amino acids 1-60) has been
shown to contain an activation domain (Didier et al., 1994;
el-Deiry et al., 1994). This activation domain interacts with
coactivators and is required for p53-mediated transcrip-
tional activation. The N-terminal domain of p53 also
interacts with other proteins, such as HDM2, which represses
p53 activity (Cook et al., 1994).

To further investigate the mechanism of p53 transcriptional
activation, we have examined the functional properties of
the N-terminal region of p53 in yeast. We have found that
the N-terminal region of p53 can be divided into two distinct
activation subdomains: one located between amino acids 1-40
and another located between amino acids 40-60. These two
subdomains are functionally independent and require the
adaptor complex ADA/ADA3/BCS for activity.

Materials and Methods
Yeast Strains and Plasmid Construction
The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.
p53 activation domain 1-40 was cloned into the pYES2 vector
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) under the control of the GAL1
promoter. p53 activation domain 40-60 was cloned into the
pYES2 vector under the control of the GAL1 promoter. The
ADA/ADA3/BCS genes were cloned into the pYES2 vector
under the control of the GAL1 promoter.

Yeast Transformations and Assays
Yeast cells were transformed with plasmids using the lithium
acetate method (Guthrie & Schiegel, 1990). Transformed
cells were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil
and galactose. Cells were induced to express p53 activation
domains and ADA/ADA3/BCS by adding 2% galactose to
the medium.

Results
Identification of Two Activation Subdomains in the N-Terminal
Region of p53
To identify the functional domains within the N-terminal region
of p53, we expressed truncated p53 proteins in yeast and
assessed their ability to activate transcription. We found that
amino acids 1-40 and 40-60 each contain an activation
domain (Fig. 1A).

1984 Waterman et al., 1982) has been found in the center
of p53 sequences (el-Deiry et al., 1994).
In addition, p53 can act as a transcriptional
repressor by downregulating the expression of certain
genes. For example, p53 represses the expression of
Sdn (Santhanam et al., 1991; Nobler et al., 1992). This
repression requires the transactivation domain of p53. Also
required for its inhibitory functions on transcription (Sang
et al., 1994; el-Deiry et al., 1994).

Tumor suppression and transcriptional activation
are often linked, but it is unclear how these two activities
coordinate. Fields and Jang, 1990; Funk et al., 1993)
suggest that p53 may function as a central coordinator
coordinates abolish transactivation and tumor sup-
pression. The ability of p53 to act as both a transcriptional
activator or repressor depends on wild type p53 responses
to stress signals (el-Deiry et al., 1994). In addition,
the cellular context is important for determining whether
which is overexpressed in 30-40% of human sarcomas
(Yokoyama et al., 1994) and lung carcinomas (el-Deiry
et al., 1994). MDM2 binds to the N-terminal region of p53
and represses its transcriptional activity (Cook et al., 1994;
Jones et al., 1994).

To further understand the mechanism by which p53 regulates
transcription, we have examined the functional properties
of the N-terminal domain of p53 in yeast. We have found
that the N-terminal region of p53 can be divided into two
distinct activation subdomains: one located between amino
acids 1-40 and another located between amino acids 40-60.
These two subdomains are functionally independent and
require the adaptor complex ADA/ADA3/BCS for activity.

THE FOOD CHEMICALS GUIDE

URea-FORMALDEHYDE RESINS (cont.) UREA FORMALDEHYDE RESINS -µ-VALINE

Petitioned June 18, 1968, would amend §177.1900 (UREA-FORMALDEHYDE RESINS) to clear use in the resins used for food-contact surfaces of molded articles of the pigments and colorants identified in §§178.50 through 178.2340. These include aluminum hydroxide, barium sulfate, bentonite, kaolin, magnesium silicate, alumina mоc., dir., and tristearate, aluminum silicate, barium sulfate, bentonite, calcium carbonate, carbon black (channel process), cobalt oxide, crysotile, copper phthalocyan-
ine, diatomaceous earth, ferric oxide, iron oxides, magnesia, manganese violet, mixed metal oxides, phthalo-
eine lake (FD&C Yellow 5 only), titanium dioxide, titanium dioxide-barium sulfate, titanium dioxide-
silica, zinc oxide, and zinc sulfide.

URethane CROSS LINKING AGENT

Petitioned June 15, 1968, would amend §177.1900 (HIGH-TEMPERATURE LAMINATES) to
clear use of polyurethane-polyester resin-epoxy adhesive formulated from the following: (1) Polyester-
polyurethane resin cleared under §177.1900 for use in polyols and 1,5-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-
1,3,5-trihydroxymethylbenzene and polymeric coatings; (2) for an epoxy resin and 1,5-isocyanatomethyl-
epoxy, other, and/or mercapto groups; (3) polyester resins formed by the reaction of polyols acids
and anhydrides cleared under §177.1900 for use in food-contact applications with a mixture containing
azelaic acid and 4-hexanediol as reactants; (4) epoxy resin cleared under §177.1905 for use in epoxy
resins; and (5) an amine curing agent formulated from 1,5-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,3,5-trihydroxy ethyl cyclo-
hexylpropane.

URETHANE POLYMER

Petitioned with Jan. 9, 1968, would clear urethane polymer derived by reaction of
polyether polyol and methylene diphenyl diamine, and use as an elastomer under §177.1900 (RUBBER
AND ELASTOMERS) in molded articles which may contact food.

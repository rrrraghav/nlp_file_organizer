Data on never-smoking decedents from the 1986 Na-
tional Mortality Followback Survey were used to per-
form a case-control analysis of ischemic heart disease
in relation to spousal cigarette smoking. The case
group consisted of 475 men and 914 women who died
from heart disease. Controls consisted of 909 men and
1682 women who died from other causes. In this study
there was no association between spousal smoking and
ischemic heart disease in either sex (males, odds ratio
= 0.97; females, odds ratio = 0.96). The results of this
study are in striking disagreement with risk elevations
reported in several previous studies of spousal smoking
and heart disease. © 1996 Air Pollution Press, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

Several epidemiologic studies have reported associa-
tions between ischemic heart disease mortality and ac-
tive smoker (ATS) exposure to environmental (E)
tobacco smoke (TS). These associations have been at-
tributed to the effects of TS on blood pressure, car-
diac function, and lipid metabolism (U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency [USEPA], 1982; U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services [USHHS],
1986). However, the evidence for a causal relation-
ship between TS exposure and ischemic heart disease
mortality is limited (US EPA, 1982; US HHS, 1986;
Slaughter, 1985). Some studies have suggested that
spousal smoking may be an important determinant of
ischemic heart disease risk in never-smoking spouses
(e.g., Schwartz, 1973; Schwartz & Ford, 1974;
Lee & Brown, 1976; Lee et al., 1982). These studies
have generally been criticized for their potential to be
influenced by uncontrolled confounding variables and
for the possibility that observed associations may re-
flect reverse causation (e.g., Schwartz, 1973;
Lee & Brown, 1976).

To address these concerns, we examined the associa-
tion between spousal smoking and ischemic heart dis-
ease mortality among never-smoking spouses using data
from the National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFs).
The NMFs is a large, nationally representative sample
of U.S. deaths that allows for examination of risk fac-
tors such as an individual’s smoking history and the
smoking habits of their close relatives, without relying
on self-reported data or making assumptions about

such an inference (Wells, 1986; Glantz and Parmey,
1991; Greenland, 1992; Taylor et al., 1992). The
National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFs),
which was based on a probability sample of adult deaths
in the United States in 1986, offered the opportunity to
perform a case-control analysis of ischemic heart dis-
ease and spousal smoking that includes more never-
smoking spouses than any previously published study.
The paper reports the results of that case-control study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The National Mortality Survey was conducted by the U.S. National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS, 1988; Seeman et al.,
1989). The survey was based on a national proba-
bility sample of 1.5% of all deaths in 1986 of resi-
dents aged about 25 years or older. This sample was
drawn from the Current Mortality Sample, a 10%
sample of U.S. residents aged one year or more
from state authorities approximately 1 month after
the death occurred. A stratified multistage cluster
sample design was used to select mortality records.
The initial sampling frame consisted of all counties
in the United States. Counties were stratified into
three categories: central cities, suburban counties,
and nonmetropolitan counties. Within each category,
counties were ranked by population size and a sample
of counties was selected using probability propor-
tional to size. Within each selected county, primary
sampling units (PSUs) were selected randomly.
Within each PSU, mortality records were selected
randomly.

The NMFs included interviews with surviving fam-
ily members or close friends of the decedent. The in-
terviews were conducted by trained interviewers using
a standardized questionnaire. Information collected
included demographic characteristics, medical history,
lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking habits), and occupa-
tional history.

CASE DEFINITIONS

Cases were defined as decedents aged 25 years or old-
er who died from ischemic heart disease. Ischemic
heart disease was coded according to the Ninth Revi-
sion of the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-9) codes 410-413. Controls were defined as
decedents aged 25 years or older who died from
causes other than ischemic heart disease.

DATA ANALYSIS

The odds ratio for spousal smoking among cases was
calculated and compared with that of controls using a
conditional logistic regression model (conditional on age,
sex, race, and education).

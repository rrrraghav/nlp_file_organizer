Macrophages produce superoxide through the assembly of a
multi-component membrane enzyme (NADPH oxidase). The
production of molecular oxygen in NADPH oxidase is associated with
the reduction of flavocytochrome b558.  The role of G proteins
in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity has been unclear until
now.  Stimulation of macrophages with phorbol esters such as Phor-
bol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces a rapid increase in
flavocytochrome b558 redox state and NADPH oxidation rate.
The mechanism by which PMA activates the NADPH oxidase is not
fully understood.  It has been suggested that G proteins may be
involved in this process, but the specific G protein(s) involved
have remained elusive.  We have now identified a small G protein,
Rac1 p21 (p21 Rac), as a potent activator of NADPH oxidase.
Here we show that Rac1 p21 is bound to GDP in resting macro-
phages and becomes activated upon stimulation with PMA.  The
GDP-bound form of Rac1 p21 is sufficient to stimulate NADPH
oxidase activity, suggesting that the binding of GTP may be an
inhibitory step in the activation process.  We also show that
Rac1 p21 interacts directly with flavocytochrome b558 and that
this interaction is enhanced upon stimulation.

The NADPH oxidase complex has made possible
the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-
duction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various ani-
mal tissues, such as arachidonic acid and SDS, to elicit
inflammatory responses.  The superoxide production sys-
tem developed from central phagocytes 1,2–4. The only mem-
brane-bound cytochrome system containing the elements of the
electron transport chain is flavocytochrome b558 (CYTB558), with
the participation of three cytosolic proteins: p47phox, p67phox
and Rac (5).  The NADPH oxidase complex also includes SOC 1 (11, 12). For using the cell-free system, evidence was found
for a GTP binding protein that is necessary for its normal
function in neutrophil extracellular environment. This was in terms
of stimulation of superoxide production by nonhydrolyzable
analogue, GTPγS, on NADPH oxidase activation (13–15). Next,
the role of G proteins in the regulation of NADPH oxidase
of the oxidase-related G protein (16, 21), and that proposed
as a possible Rac1 p21 family member (22).

We have purified the intact cell form and macrophage cytosol to
have homogeneity and found that it contained two proteins,
p47phox and Rac1 p21.  The molecular weight of p47phox is
amino acid indicating the peptide derived from the 25-kDa
subunit of NADPH oxidase. The molecular weight of Rac1 p21 is
21 kDa, as suggested by its previous identification (23). Partial
purification of the cytosolic fraction revealed that these two
proteins were associated with each other.  We have now shown
that Rac1 p21 is bound to GDP in resting macrophages and
becomes activated upon stimulation with PMA. The GDP-bound
form of Rac1 p21 is sufficient to stimulate NADPH oxidase ac-
tivity, suggesting that the binding of GTP may be an inhibitory
step in the activation process.  We also show that Rac1 p21 inter-
acts directly with flavocytochrome b558 and that this interaction
is enhanced upon stimulation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Purification of Macrophage Cytosol—Bone marrow derived macro-
phages were prepared as described previously (17).  Cells were
lysed by hypotonic shock, and the cytosol was purified by a series
of centrifugation steps. The cytosolic fraction was further purified
by affinity chromatography using Cibacron Blue 3G agarose (18).

Western Blot Analysis—Samples of macrophage cytosol were sepa-
rated on SDS-acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose mem-
branes.  The membranes were probed with antibodies against p47phox
and Rac1 p21 (19).

Binding Assays—Macrophage cytosol was incubated with 35S-GTPγS
or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, and the bound radioactivity
was determined by filtration.

NADPH Oxidase Assay—Superoxide production was measured by
the reduction of ferricyanide (20).  Samples were incubated with
ferricyanide and NADPH, and superoxide production was monitored
by measuring the absorbance change at 490 nm.

Immunoprecipitation—Macrophage cytosol was incubated with anti-
Rac1 p21 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by
Western blotting using antibodies against flavocytochrome b558.

RESULTS

Identification of Rac1 p21 in Macrophage Cytosol—Western blot
analysis of macrophage cytosol revealed two prominent bands at
approximately 25 kDa and 21 kDa, corresponding to p47phox and
Rac1 p21, respectively (Fig. 1A).  The specificity of the anti-Rac1
p21 antibody was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Rac1 p21
from macrophage cytosol followed by Western blotting (data not
shown).

Binding of GDP to Rac1 p21—To determine the nucleotide bind-
ing state of Rac1 p21 in resting macrophages, we incubated cyto-
sol with 35S-GTPγS.  The amount of radioactivity bound per mg
of protein was low (Fig. 1B).  Treatment of the cytosol with PMA
resulted in a significant increase in GTPγS binding (Fig. 1B), sug-
gesting that Rac1 p21 is activated upon stimulation.

Activation of NADPH Oxidase by GDP-bound Rac1 p21—To
determine whether the GDP-bound form of Rac1 p21 is sufficient
to stimulate NADPH oxidase activity, we incubated purified cyto-
sol with anti-Rac1 p21 antibody and then added NADH and ferri-
cyanide.  The addition of the immunoprecipitated complex resulted
in a significant increase in superoxide production (Fig. 1C).

Interaction of Rac1 p21 with Flavocytochrome b558—To deter-
mine whether Rac1 p21 interacts directly with flavocytochrome
b558, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-
Rac1 p21 antibody followed by Western blotting using antibodies
against flavocytochrome b558.  A band corresponding to fla-
vocytochrome b558 was detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1D).
Treatment of the cytosol with PMA resulted in an enhanced interac-
tion between Rac1 p21 and flavocytochrome b558 (Fig. 1D).

DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that Rac1 p21 is a potent activator of
NADPH oxidase in macrophages.  We have shown that Rac1 p21 is
bound to GDP in resting macrophages and becomes activated upon
stimulation with PMA. The GDP-bound form of Rac1 p21 is suffi-
cient to stimulate NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that the bind-
ing of GTP may be an inhibitory step in the activation process.  We
have also shown that Rac1 p21 interacts directly with flavocyto-
chrome b558 and that this interaction is enhanced upon stimula-
tion.

The involvement of G proteins in NADPH oxidase activation has
been suggested previously (13–15). However, the specific G pro-
tein(s) involved have remained elusive.  Our results identify Rac1
p21 as a key regulator of NADPH oxidase activity. The finding that
Rac1 p21 is bound to GDP in resting macrophages and becomes
activated upon stimulation with PMA suggests that GTP binding
may be an inhibitory step in the activation process. This is con-
sistent with the observation that nonhydrolyzable analogues of GTP,
such as GTPγS, can stimulate NADPH oxidase activity (13–15).

The interaction between Rac1 p21 and flavocytochrome b558
suggests that Rac1 p21

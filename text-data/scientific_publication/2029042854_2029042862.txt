Studies of the etiology of rapidly fatal diseases often rely on surrogate information, such as that obtained from a surviving spouse. We examined the validity of questionnaire responses were interviewed in 1983-1984 for the same histories provided earlier by their husbands. Two hundred thirty-two cases and 232 controls were selected from New Mexico, 1980-1982. Both interviews obtained detailed information concerning lifetime occupational history, smoking habits, dietary practices, and use of supplements high in vitamin A. With regard to lifetime occupations, the wives reported significantly fewer jobs. Concordance of the coded histories was approximately 65% for occupation and 37% for industry. The most frequent job and usual job held. Wives commonly reported cigarette smoking substantially less than their husbands. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was 4.8 times lower among wives who smoked than when their husbands smoked ambiently more or less. The mean concordance of the percentage of time spent smoking was 37% at the controls were comparable.

Rising young a puzzle

Viruses and environment are leukemia suspects

With all the publicity given in recent years to the Canadian Cancer Socie-
ty’s study of lung cancer incidence,
the lung, the public might tend to
overlook the fact that leukemia is
involved in all types of cancer —
and that there is a growing need for
research to help cure them and trying
to find out what causes them. Trends
in the progress of any type of
cancer are of particular interest.
The most striking trend is the in-
crease of leukemia, which is a con-
cern because it brings us closer to
something happening with people to
cause this disease.

For years up to 1953 there was lit-
tle change; then there were 245 more
deaths from leukemia for every 10
years until 1967 — resulting in a
figure of 8.3 per 100,000 population
which translates to complete
figures of 2,133 deaths (p. 21).
213. At one time it was generally con-
sidered that leukemia was a disease
of childhood, but now the incidence
in older people is rising rapidly.

The type of leukemia involved is
important. Acute leukemias are
more common in children; chronic
leukemias are more common in adults.
There are several types of acute leu-
kemias, and the prognosis depends on
the type of cell affected. The most com-
mon type is acute lymphoblastic leu-
kemia, which accounts for about 80
per cent of cases in children. In ad-
ults, acute myelogenous leukemia is
more common. Chronic leukemias are
diseases characterized by rapid
increase in the rate of production
of abnormal white blood cells. The type
of leukemia depends on the type of
white blood cell involved, its size,
and the rate of progression of
the disease. Most cases can be classified into
one of several types which include
chronic, in their speed of development
the cells behave like cancer cells.

The prognosis for children with leu-
kemias is in children there are
about 60 per cent chance of survival to
every two women. White people have a

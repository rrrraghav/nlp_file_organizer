INTRODUCTION

By September, 1990, there were 146 different cytochromes P450 that had
been cloned and sequenced (1). The genes for these hemoproteins have
been described in a total of 24 eukaryotes (including 10 mammalian and 1
plant species) and 4 prokaryotes. For each P450 gene that has been studied
in detail one can estimate that there are at least three additional genes in the
process of being evaluated or waiting to be identified. The P450s that have
been characterized can be classified into 26 gene families (Fig. 1) based on
protein sequence similarity (viz in most cases a member of a P450 family
will have greater than 40 percent amino acid sequence similarity).
Clearly, the P450s represent a large superfamily of hemoproteins that
touch many central paths of cellular metabolism across the breadth of
phylogeny.

We recognize that one primary function of P450s is to alter the
oxidation-reduction state of a chemical by the removal of two electrons.
This transformation involves, in most cases, molecular oxygen and a source
of reducing equivalents, such as NADPH. The reducing equivalents from
NADPH can be transferred to a particular P450 by either of two
types of mini-electron transport systems (i.e. the FAD and FMN
containing flavoprotein, NAD(P)H:cytochrome P450 reductase, for those
P450s associated with microsomal membranes, or the non-flavoprotein and
iron-sulfur protein system characteristic of mitochondrial P450s) (2). One
consequence of oxidizing an organic chemical by a P450 is the generation
of reactive electrophilic metabolites which may interact with cellular

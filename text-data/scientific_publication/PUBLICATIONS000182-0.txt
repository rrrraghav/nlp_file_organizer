[3] Structural and Functional Identification of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor-Like Proteins Produced by Mammalian Cells

BY HARRY N. ANTONIADES AND PANAYOTIS PANTZIS

Introduction

The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) revealed that it consists of two homologous polypeptide chains named PDGF-1 and PDGF-2.' The PDGF-2 chain has been shown to be near identical to a portion of the transforming gene product of the simian sarcoma virus (SSV),² an acute transforming retrovirus of primate origin. Characterization of its sequence has localized its transform- ing gene to its cell-derived onc sequence, v-sis³, which codes for a protein [p28] consisting of 226 amino acid residues.* The region of p28 corres- ponding to PDGF starts at the serine residue in position 67, which fol- lows a double basic (Lys-Arg) sequence at positions 65-66.4 This appears to be the processing point yielding a polypeptide of 160 residues with a molecular size of 18,056 Da, essentially the same size estimated for PDGF-2 chain on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.' However, the SSV onc gene codes only for the PDGF-2 chain of the PDGF polypeptide. It was important, therefore, to establish whether the one gene product was functioning as a single polypeptide chain or in a conformational manner similar to the dimeric formation of

Abstract—The yield of N-methylputrescine oxidase extracted from Nicotiana rustica roots grown in organ culture was
improved by supplementing White’s medium with 1·5 mM (NH₄)₂SO₄. The enzyme was purified from these roots by
salt fractionation, anion exchange, affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The purified protein had
V, 54000 by SDS-PAGE.

INTRODUCTION

The pyroline ring of nicotinine is produced from putrescine by methylation and oxidation to N-methyl-
1'-pyrrolinium salt [1]. The enzyme which oxidizes N-
methylputrescine was first described by Mizusaki et al. [2]
and has been purified from various sources [3, 4]. When the
enzyme had not been purified to homogeneity when [3]
described a partial purification procedure that is similar to
the purification procedure for roots of N. rustica.

Enzyme activity in White’s medium:
White's medium + (NH₄)₂SO₄

amount of extracted enzyme increased with the concentration
of the increased yields of root tissue. Even at a high rate
(1·5 mM), the specific activity of the enzyme was not
increased. Therefore, an inhibitory level of substrate on enzyme
activity in root tissue. The observed stimulation of
growth by N-methylputrescine might be explained by an
amine oxidation catalyzed by an amine oxidase:

MENHCH₂CN + H₂O → MENHCH₂COOH + NH₃

N-methylputrescine, C₅H₁₃N₂, is a urea-type compound
with a methyl group substituted on one of the amino
groups. N-methylputrescine can be produced from
putrescine by S-adenosylmethionine: putrescine
methyltransferase [5]. The enzyme N-methylputrescine
oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of N-methylputrescine to
N-methylpyrrolinium, which is then further oxidized to
nicotinine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plant culture—Nicotiana rustica L. was cultured in
vitro as described by [6]. Roots were grown in White’s
medium supplemented with 1·5 mM (NH₄)₂SO₄.

Enzyme extraction—Roots were harvested after 4 weeks
of growth and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissue
was ground to a fine powder in the presence of ice-cold
buffer A (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7·8, 1 mM DTT). The
homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min and
the supernatant was used immediately or stored at -20°C.

Protein determination—Protein concentrations were
determined by the Bradford method [7] using bovine
serum albumin as a standard.

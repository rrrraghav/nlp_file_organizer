Background—To date, no biological markers have been identified that can
predict the extent of fetal exposure to the toxic constituents of cigarette smoke. A
variety of xenobiotlc agents have been shown to accumulate in growing hair.
Patients and Methods—We measured maternal and neonatal hair concentra-
tions of nicotine and cotinine in 64 mother-infant pairs. Mothers who were active
smokers, recent smokers, or passive smokers (n=32) were included.
Results—Mothers who were active smokers (n=15) had a mean (SEM) hair con-
centrations of 19.3 (1.4) ng/mg for nicotine and 6.4 (0.8) ng/mg for cotinine, signifi-
cantly higher than concentrations in nonmokers (n=35) (1.2 (0.4) ng/mg for nicot-
ine and 0.3 (0.1) ng/mg for cotinine, p<0.001). Cotinine hair concentrations were also
significantly higher in recent smokers (range, 0 to 25 ng/mg) and 2.8 (0.6)
ng/mg in passive smokers (n=12) compared with nonmokers. Neonatal hair con-
centrations of nicotine (0.4 (0.09) ng/mg) for nicotine and 0.3 (0.04) ng/mg for
cotinine were significantly correlated with maternal hair concentrations (r=0.72,
p<0.001; r=0.65, p<0.001). Mothers who smoke during pregnancy reported the use of neonatal
hair testing in 39% of cases.
Conclusions—Hair concentrations of nicotine and cotinine are useful markers
of maternal cigarette smoking exposure during pregnancy. The correlation between
maternal and neonatal hair concentrations suggests that hair samples can be used to
assess fetal exposure to cigarette smoke. Neonatal hair testing may be a valuable tool
for identifying pregnant women who smoke and for monitoring compliance with inter-
vention programs. (Am J Perinatol 1994;16:187-192)

Summary

The possible toxic effect of intravenous 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), a steroid
which has been shown to inhibit cholesterol flux in the arterial wall, was
investigated in rabbits. The histology, hematology and blood chemistry were
compared in 4 control animals, 3 animals receiving high doses (5.50 ± 0.33 mg/
kg/day) and 4 animals injected with lower doses (1.85 ± 0.25 mg/kg/day) of
the oxygenated sterol. Each animal received a total of 16 injections at the rate
of 2 injections per day. Pharmacokinetic studies on the disappearance rate of
14C-7KC were also carried out. In one animal exposed to the higher concentra-
tion of 7-KC, some granulomata were seen in the lung was noticed. Changes in
the liver were not significantly different from those observed in the control
animals. Inhibition of arterial flux of cholesterol (inhibition of 0549) was
noticed with high and low doses of the oxygenated sterol. The disappearance
curves of [14C]cholesterol in blood and plasma were characteristic of a
higher than tissue efflux and there was no reducing tissue uptake of 7-KC was
results indicate that it is possible to depress cholesterol flux in the arterial wall
of rabbits without causing major toxic changes and that both red cells and
tissue act as a reservoir for the oxygenated sterol.

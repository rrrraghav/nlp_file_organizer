Dose-Dependent Interleukin-3 Stimulation of Thrombopoiesis
and Neutropoiesis in Patients With Small-Cell Lung
Carcinoma Before and Following Chemotherapy: A Placebo-
Controlled Randomized Phase II Study

Purpose: To evaluate the influence of recombinant human interleukin-3
(IL-3) on thrombopoiesis, neutropoiesis, and platelet counts in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) before
and following multicyclic antineoplastic therapy in a
placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study.

Patients and Methods: Seventy-two male patients aged 55 to 72 years
and six women median age, 60 years with previously untreated SCLC were enrolled. Patients were as-
signed to six groups receiving doses of IL-3 ranging
from 0 to 10 µg/kg administered subcutaneously once
daily for 7 days, with one patient in each group re-
ceiving placebo. Chemotherapy (CV) was initiated on
week cycles of carboplatin 450 mg/m2 and etoposide
300 mg/m2. IL-3 was administered 1 week before
chemotherapy, starting 1 week after chemotherapy.

Results: The same daily dose was admin-
istered in all groups. At the time of IL-3 administration,
the mean platelet count was significantly higher in patients
receiving IL-3 than in those receiving placebo (p < .001).
Neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels were also signifi-
cantly increased in the IL-3 groups compared with the pla-
cebo group (p < .001). Peripheral blood reticulocyte
counts, mean corpuscular volume, and red cell distri-
bution width were not significantly different between
groups. During chemotherapy, dose-dependent increases
in circulating platelets and neutrophils were observed in
patients receiving IL-3 compared with those receiving pla-
cebo (p < .001). The absolute neutrophil count was sig-
nificantly higher in patients receiving IL-3 than in those re-
ceiving placebo during chemotherapy (p < .001). Platelet
counts were also significantly increased in the IL-3 groups
compared with the placebo group during chemotherapy
(p < .001). The mean duration of severe neutropenia was
shorter in patients receiving IL-3 than in those receiving
placebo (4.9 vs 7.2 days, p = .015). The incidence of
thrombocytopenia was lower in patients receiving IL-3 than
in those receiving placebo (16% vs 41%, p = .018).

Conclusions: Recombinant human IL-3 stimulates thromo-
poiesis and neutropoiesis in patients with SCLC before
and during chemotherapy. The increased platelet counts
and neutrophil counts observed with IL-3 administration
may reduce the duration of severe neutropenia and the
incidence of thrombocytopenia, potentially improving sur-
vival.

were observed. Following the second cycle of CVL, re-
covery of peripheral blood counts was faster as com-
pared with patients receiving placebo treated with
7.5 and 10 µg/kg of IL-3 (p = .021). Chemotherapy
was postponed in two patients due to severe thrombocytopenia
during the second cycle of CVL as compared
with one patient in the placebo group (p = .046). IL-3
(p < .036). Compared with age-matched historical
controls, platelet counts and neutrophil counts after ad-
ministration of IL-3 did not modify disease-free
survival or overall survival rates.

Conclusion: IL-3 is well tolerated at doses up to 10
µg/kg/d. In the absence of other therapeutic se-
quences, IL-3 may increase platelet counts and
2.5 µg/kg/d. It has an influence on the biology of
myelopoiesis, but does not improve survival or
group receiving placebo.

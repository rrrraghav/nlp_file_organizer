SUMMARY.—Lymphosarcoma occurred often in the WH strain of rabbits and had a hereditary basis. Lymphosarcoma appeared in 16 females and 13 males. The inheritance indicated an autosomal recessive gene con-
cerning susceptibility to lymphosarcoma. We designated this gene Is. Our data were compatible with both concepts of genetic susceptibility to lympho-
sarcoma and vertical transmission of a virus. Affected rabbits usually died between the ages of 5 and 13 months. The neoplastic involvement of
lymphoreticular organs and other organs, especially kidneys, corresponded to a pattern observed in lymphosarcoma of other domestic animals. Specif-
ically, it resembled in many ways visceral lymphosarcomas of cats which has been proved unequivocally to be caused by feline leukemia virus.
The similarity between rabbit and cat lymphosarcomas involved both sites of tumor development and the neoplastic lesions and the hematologic
findings of a predominantly leukemic picture. However, in rabbit lympho-
sarcomas, both immature and atypical forms of lymphoid cells were found which included immunocytes and plasma cells. Because rabbits are valuable
in laboratory investigations, the finding of lymphosarcoma provides a new and important model for oncogenic research. 1 Not Cancer Int. 4(5):769–799, 1970.

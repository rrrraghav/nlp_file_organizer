Our goal was to examine in vivo responses of resistance arterioles contained within the hamster cheek pouch microcirculation
to activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (K+) channels. We measured changes in diameter of check pouch arterioles in response
to activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels using Apkalim and BRL 38227, a potent activator of these channels. Both
Apkalim and BRL 38227 produced dose-related dilatation of arterioles, which was inhibited by glibenclamide (1.0 µM), but not
altered by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 1.0 µM). Glibenclamide did not alter baseline diameter of check pouch
arterioles and did not affect dilatation of cheek pouch arterioles in response to nitroprusside (10 µM). L-NMMA did not
alter dilatation of arterioles in response to nitroprusside, but inhibited dilatation of arterioles to acetylcholine (0.1 and 1.0 µM). Thus,
dilatation of arterioles in response to activation of K+ channels appears to be specific and is not associated with the
release of nitric oxide or a nitric oxide containing compound. The findings of the present study suggest that ATP-sensitive K+
channels are functional in resistance arterioles in vivo, but do not appear to affect resting tone of cheek pouch arterioles.

1. Introduction

Potassium channels, which ubiquitously reside in
intracellular cellular membranes, play an important role in
establishing and maintaining membrane potential. ATP-sensitive
K+ channels are one subgroup of potassium channels that
open in response to changes in intracellular ATP concentrations
[e.g., Nicholls et al., 1986; Kelly & Duffield, 1987;
Ashcroft, 1990].  Several ATP-sensitive K+ channel openers
have been identified [e.g., Garlapati & Martin, 1985;
Iwaki et al., 1983; Inesi et al., 1986; Yasaka et al., 1987;
Bauer et al., 1988;  Wulff et al., 1989]. Apkalim [e.g.,
Iwaki et al., 1983;  Yasaka et al., 1987] and BRL 38227
[e.g.,  Bauer et al., 1988] are two such compounds. The
vasodilatory effects of ATP-sensitive K+ channel openers have
been demonstrated in isolated vascular preparations [e.g.,
Iwaki et al., 1983; Yasaka et al., 1987;  Bauer et al., 1988;
Wulff et al., 1989].

The role of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the regulation of
vascular tone in vivo remains unclear. Nitric oxide (NO) is a
potent vasodilator that is released from endothelial cells [e.g.,
Furedy et al., 1989; Bredt et al., 1990; Garthwaite, 1991;
Sandros et al., 1991].  In some instances, the vasodilatory
effects of ATP-sensitive K+ channel openers have been attributed
to NO release [e.g.,  Nagao et al., 1991; McCaron et al., 1991;
Ksoli et al., 1991; Standen et al., 1989; Faraci and
Heistad, 1993], we were interested in determining the
effects of activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels on
resistance arterioles in vivo. We used the hamster cheek pouch
preparation to examine this question. The cheek pouch is an
ectopic tumor that contains a network of arterioles which
possess endothelial cells and smooth muscle [e.g.,  Mayhan
et al., 1983; Mayhan & Tank, 1985]. This preparation allows
for direct measurement of arteriolar diameter in vivo. We
hypothesized that activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels
would cause dilatation of resistance arterioles and that this
effect would be associated with the release of NO.

2. Materials and Methods

Hamsters (male, 60–80 g) were anesthetized with
pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p.). The cheek pouch was
exposed surgically and placed on a heated stage in a
perfused organ bath containing physiological salt solution
(PSS; see Mayhan et al., 1983). PSS was continuously
oxygenated and maintained at 37°C.

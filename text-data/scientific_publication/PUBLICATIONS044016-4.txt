Abstract. To provide a cytogenetic marker for nuclear transplantation experiments, triploid Rana pipiens embryos
were produced. These embryos were injected with Xenopus laevis herpes virus. The chromosome profile of a renal carcinoma that
developed in one embryo was compared to the chromosomal profiles of a naturally occurring diploid renal
carcinoma and a diploid renal tumor maintained as serial ante-
rior eye allografts for over 2 years. Examination of Ag-
NOR-stained chromosomes spreads from the putative triploid
and naturally occurring diploid tumors revealed the
expected results. The vast majority of the chromosome spreads,

54/57 (95%) and 6/7 (86%), respectively, displayed euploid chromosome and Ag-NOR profiles. 3N = 39 with three Ag-
NORs at the secondary constriction of the long arm of chro-
mosome 10 (pql) and 2N = 26 with two Ag-NORs in 10s.
The chromosomal profiles from the diploid tumors were
highly aneuploid (82%) and, based on their Ag-NOR con-
tent, displayed variations in 3N, 2N, and 4N numbers.
These results indicate that the early transformed triploid
Xenopus laevis tumor cells can provide nuclei suitable for
the characterization of developmental potential.

Nuclear transplantation in vertebrates was initially devel-
oped in the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens (Briggs and
King, 1952). Because gynogenesis is possible in frogs, great care
must be taken to avoid the formation of diploid embryos
when attempting to produce triploid animals. The procedure in
its simplest form involves fusion of two mononucleate eggs
(Kumashiro, 1952) or injection of a sperm pronucleus into
an enucleated egg (Lee et al., 1953). Evidence that such
triploids can be produced in Rana pipiens has been provided
by several workers (e.g., Allen and Haws, 1964; Allen et al.,
1967; Haws and Allen, 1968). The triploid condition is often
associated with a variety of developmental abnormalities
(Allen et al., 1967), but in some cases, the animals appear
normal (Haws and Allen, 1968).

Stable chromosome markers have not been detected in R.
pipiens until Dawkins (1973), who did not then themselves to use as
markers in nuclear transplantation studies that term is terminated
by natural death or by artificial means before the experimentally
produced triploids can be evaluated for developmental potential.
The presence of a readily identifiable and stably inherited
marker on the frog genome would be invaluable for assessing
the fidelity of nuclear transfer.

In an attempt to obtain such a marker, we injected R.
pipiens eggs with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1
is known to induce chromosome aberrations in mammalian cells
(e.g., Miller et al., 1972) and has been used to produce poly-
ploid cells in Xenopus laevis (Brown and Weintraub, 1980).
In one instance, the HSV-1 injection resulted in the develop-
ment of an embryo that subsequently produced a renal carci-
noma. Cytogenetic analysis of this tumor revealed a triploid
chromosome complement with a readily identifiable marker.

Materials and Methods

Animal Husbandry

Adult Rana pipiens were obtained from a commercial supplier
(Sequim, WA). Eggs were collected in 0.1% methylcellulose
solution and allowed to develop at room temperature (22°C)
under constant illumination.

Virus Preparation and Egg Injection

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was grown in Vero cells
and titrated by plaque assay. Approximately 5 x 10^7 plaque-forming units (pfu) of HSV-1 were injected into one-cell stage R.
pipiens eggs using a fine glass needle under a stereomicroscope.

Cytogenetic Analysis

Chromosomes were prepared from the renal carcinoma tumor
using standard techniques (Andersen, 1964). The chromosomes
were stained with Giemsa and examined for chromosome number
and morphology. NOR staining was performed by impregnating
the chromosomes with silver nitrate (Seeman et al., 1975).

Results

A single embryo among 23 injected eggs developed a renal
carcinoma. This tumor exhibited a triploid chromosome com-
plement (3N = 39) and three Ag-NOR regions located at the
secondary constriction of the long arm of chromosome 10 (pql).
The chromosomal profiles from the diploid tumors were highly aneuploid (82%) and, based on their Ag-NOR content, displayed variations in 3N, 2N, and 4N numbers.

Discussion

The presence of a triploid renal carcinoma in an HSV-1 injected
Rana pipiens embryo provides a unique opportunity to study the
cytogenetics of experimentally induced tumors in this species.
The chromosomal profile of the tumor was consistent with that
of a triploid cell, and the presence of three Ag-NOR regions
confirmed its triploid nature. The diploid tumors exhibited
highly aneuploid chromosomal profiles, which is not unexpected
in spontaneously arising tumors (Comings, 1973).

The results of this study suggest that HSV-1 infection can be
used to induce chromosome aberrations in R. pipiens eggs, and
that these aberrations can lead to the development of tumors.
The triploid nature of the tumor provides a valuable cytogenetic
marker for future nuclear transplantation experiments.

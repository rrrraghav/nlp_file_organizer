SUMMARY—Smoke condensates from several brands of commercial
cigarettes were tested for carcinogenic potency. Papillons and skin concen-
trates were prepared by various methods. Smoke condensates from British
cigarettes was significantly more carcinogenic than that from American
cigarettes when equal amounts of tar were applied to the skin. The data
suggest that the carcinogenic activity of cigarette smoke varies with
the specific composition, the method of manufacture, or both.-3 Natl

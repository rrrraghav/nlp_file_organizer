Abstract

The mutagenic activity of cigarette smoke condensates (CSC) made from tobacco before and after removal of protein was
assessed by the Ames Salmonella assay in bacterial strains TA98 and TA100. Removal of protein and peptides from
flue-cured tobacco via water extraction followed by protease digestion reduced the mutagenicity of the resultant CSC by
80% in TA98 and 74% in TA100 strains. Significant reductions of 5136 to 7450 in TA100 were seen
following water extraction and protease digestion of burley tobacco. The significant reductions in Ames mutagenicity
observed following protein removal suggest that proteins are a principal contributor to the genotoxicity of CSC as
measured in this assay. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

In 1977, Suemura’s laboratory at the National
Cancer Center in Tokyo published the first of a
series of papers on a group of high mutagenic
heterocycles amines derived from the pyrolysis of
proteins and amino acids found in cooked [1], [2]. Few
loving metabolic activities such as these, uses
compounds are among the most potent mutagens
ever measured by the Ames assay [3]. Cigarette
smoke contains several of these heterocyclic amine
mutagens [4], [5].

Mainstream smoke has been reported to contain a
number of heterocyclic amines. The compounds re-
ported in cigarette smoke include the following: 2-amino-
3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) [6,7], 2-amino-
3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) [1], [8],
PhIP and Glu-Tyr [9], Trp-P [6], [10], Trp-2-P [11],
2-amino-1-methyl-5-phenylimidazo[4,5-g]
pyridine (AαC) [12], 2-amino-9H-thieno[4,3-h]-
pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeAαC) [6,9,13].

The formation of heterocyclic amines is dependent
on a number of factors including the type of food or
combustion product, temperature, time, and the in-
gredients present. In cigarette smoke, these heterocy-
cles are believed to be formed by reactions between
amino acids and carbohydrates at high temperatures [14],
[15]. It is also known that a number of nitrogenous

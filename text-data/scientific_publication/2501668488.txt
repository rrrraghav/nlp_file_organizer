ABSTRACT. The base pairing interactions of protonated
0°-MeGua with thymine and cytosine were studied by means of
spectroscopic measurements.  The results show that the
protonated form of 0°-methylguanine is a stable hydrogen bond
donor, capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with both
thymine and cytosine. The formation of protonated base pairs
is favored in aqueous solution at pH values below approximately
5.  The stability of these interactions suggests that protonation
may play an important role in the biological activity of 0°-
methylguanine, a potent antitumor drug.  The observed hydrogen
bonding between protonated 0°-MeGua and thymine is
consistent with the ability of this modified base to disrupt DNA
replication. The formation of stable protonated base pairs
between 0°-MeGua and cytosine may also contribute to its
antitumor activity.

Protonation of guanine derivatives at N2 or O6 can alter
their hydrogen bonding properties (1, 2).  The antitumor drug
0°-methylguanine (0°-MeGua) has been shown to disrupt DNA
replication and cell division (3-5).  Although the precise
mechanism of action is not fully understood, it is believed that
the modified base interferes with normal base pairing.  We have
investigated the hydrogen bonding interactions of protonated
0°-MeGua with thymine and cytosine in aqueous solution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 0°-Methylguanine was obtained
from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Thymine and cytosine were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, Missouri.  All reagents were of reagent grade
and used without further purification.  The UV-Vis spectra
were recorded on a Cary Model 340A spectrophotometer.
The pH was adjusted with HCl or NaOH using a pH meter
(Beckman Model 240).

RESULTS. The protonated form of 0°-MeGua, [0°-MeGuaH]+,
forms stable hydrogen bonds with both thymine and cytosine.
The UV-Vis spectra of the base pairs are shown in Fig. 1.  The
maximum absorbance for the 0°-MeGua-thymine pair is at
293 nm, while that for the 0°-MeGua-cytosine pair is at 285
nm. The stability of these interactions suggests that protonation
may play an important role in the biological activity of
0°-MeGua.  The formation of stable protonated base pairs
between 0°-MeGua and cytosine may also contribute to its
antitumor activity.

DISCUSSION. The hydrogen bonding properties of
protonated bases are significantly different from those of their
neutral counterparts (6).  Protonation increases the hydrogen
bonding donor ability of guanine derivatives, allowing them to
form stronger interactions with both thymine and cytosine.
The stability constants for the formation of protonated base pairs
are relatively high, indicating that these interactions are quite
strong. The observed hydrogen bonding between protonated
0°-MeGua and thymine is consistent with the ability of this
modified base to disrupt DNA replication.  The protonation of
0°-MeGua is favored at pH values below approximately 5.
At higher pH values, the neutral form predominates, and the
base pairing properties are more characteristic of normal
guanine.

The ambiguous pairing properties of 0°-MeGua can be
explained by the fact that it can form stable hydrogen bonds
with both thymine and cytosine when protonated.  This means
that 0°-MeGua can substitute for either guanine or adenine in
DNA, leading to miscoding and disruption of DNA replication.
The stability does not any other 0°-MeGua base pair, whereas
0°-MeGua-cytosine base pairs do the base destabilizing
effect.  The protonated form of 0°-MeGua is a strong base
and is the polymerization. It forms the least stable base
pair with cytosine. The formation of this base pair either
that base pairing is not as important as generally
believed in the biological activity of 0°-MeGua.  The
MeGua base pairing the polymerase complex offer signif-
icant resistance to DNA repair.  We have shown that the
base at pH 3 (11). It indicated by UV that the base has
a strong hydrogen bonding with cytosine. The protonated
0°-MeGua is a strong hydrogen bond donor, capable of
forming stable hydrogen bonds with both thymine and
cytosine.  The formation of protonated base pairs between
0°-MeGua and cytosine may also contribute to its
antitumor activity.

The ambiguous pairing properties of 0°-MeGua are
consistent with the ability of this modified base to disrupt
DNA replication. The hydrogen bonding interactions have
shown that the protonated 0°-MeGua is a strong hydrogen
bond donor, capable of forming stable hydrogen bonds with
both thymine and cytosine.  The formation of protonated
base pairs between 0°-MeGua and cytosine may also
contribute to its antitumor activity.

The stability constants for the formation of protonated base
pairs are relatively high, indicating that these interactions are
quite strong. The observed hydrogen bonding between
protonated 0°-MeGua and thymine is consistent with the
ability of this modified base to disrupt DNA replication.  The
protonation of 0°-MeGua is favored at pH values below
approximately 5. At higher pH values, the neutral form
predominates, and the base pairing properties are more
characteristic of normal guanine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor Cell Culture and Tissue Culture Medium. All cell lines were grown in tissue culture medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine,
10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 pg/ml penicillin and 100 pg/ml streptomycin) until at least 70% confluency prior to use. Tumor cells were harvested from tissue culture dishes with brief trypsin-EDTA treatment (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY). Cell suspensions were adjusted with a microhematometer. Trypsin Blue solution for viability staining was used as previously described. Tissue culture medium was supplemented with 10% tissue culture supplement (Gibco Laboratories) prior to addition of fetal calf serum.

Animals. Female C57BL/6 mice, 6-8 weeks old, were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room under a 12 hr light/dark cycle and given free access to food and water. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the New York University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Experimental Design. Groups of mice (n = 15 for CT26, n = 14 for Lewis lung, and n = 20 for B16) received an intravenous injection of tumor cells (1 x 106 in 0.2 ml of tissue culture medium) via the tail vein. Control groups consisted of similar numbers of mice that received an intravenous injection of tumor cells alone. Experimental groups also received a single dose of PG12 (100 pg, dissolved in 0.2 ml of saline) 5 min prior to and thenophylline (10 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.2 ml of saline) 2 hr post-i.v. injection of tumor cells.

Tumor Metastasis Assay. Four weeks after tumor cell injection, mice were sacrificed by an overdose of ether. Lungs were removed and fixed in 10% formalin. Metastatic nodules were counted on serial sections (4 pm thick) cut through the lungs. The number of metastatic nodules per lung was recorded for each mouse.

Statistical Analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
CT26 Colon Carcinoma. Mice injected with CT26 colon carcinoma cells developed pulmonary metastases within 4 weeks (Table 1). The average number of metastatic nodules per lung in the control group was 18.7 ± 3.1, while the experimental group receiving PG12 and thenophylline had an average of 19.5 ± 2.8 metastatic nodules per lung. This difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Lewis Lung Carcinoma. Mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells also developed pulmonary metastases within 4 weeks (Table 1). The control group had an average of 23.6 ± 4.2 metastatic nodules per lung, while the experimental group receiving PG12 and thenophylline had an average of 25.9 ± 3.7 metastatic nodules per lung. This difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

B16 Melanoma Cells. Mice injected with B16 melanoma cells developed pulmonary metastases within 4 weeks (Table 1). The control group had an average of 28.4 ± 3.9 metastatic nodules per lung, while the experimental group receiving PG12 and thenophylline had an average of 29.7 ± 4.5 metastatic nodules per lung. This difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

DISCUSSION
Honn et al. (1) reported that PGE1 and thenophylline significantly reduced pulmonary metastases in mice injected with B16 melanoma cells. Our results, however, indicate that PG12 and thenophylline had no effect on the development of pulmonary metastases when used with CT26 colon carcinoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, or B16 amelanotic melanoma cells.

The differences between our findings and those of Honn et al. (1) may be due to several factors. First, we used different strains of mice. We used C57BL/6 mice, while Honn et al. used Balb/c mice. Second, the doses of PG12 and thenophylline may have been different. We administered 100 pg PG12 and 10 mg/kg thenophylline, while Honn et al. administered a higher dose of PGE1 (1 mg/kg) and thenophylline (20 mg/kg). Third, the timing of administration of PG12 and thenophylline may have been different. We administered PG12 5 min prior to and thenophylline 2 hr post-i.v. injection of tumor cells, while Honn et al. administered PGE1 30 min prior to the injection of tumor cells and thenophylline simultaneously with PGE1. Finally, the method of measuring metastases may have differed. We counted metastatic nodules on serial sections of the lungs, while Honn et al. used a different method.

The lack of effect of PG12 and thenophylline on pulmonary metastasis in our experiments suggests that the mechanism by which these agents inhibit metastasis may be tumor-specific or strain-dependent. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of PGE1 and thenophylline in the development of pulmonary metastases in mice.

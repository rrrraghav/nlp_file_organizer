INTRODUCTION

Epidemiological considerations

There is overwhelming epidemiological evidence that an association exists between cigarette smoking and vascular disease, in particular atherosclerosis (Auerbach et al., 1955; 1976; Auerbach and Garfinkel 1980; Dawber et al., 1959; Doll and Peto, 1976; Eastwood, 1962; Kannel et al., 1976; Laring et al., 1941; Murphy and Mustard, 1966; Sackett et al., 1968; Spain and Brandes, 1970; Strong and Richardson, 1976). Despite this considerable epidemiological data, the component or components of cigarette smoke responsible for this relationship and the mechanisms through which they mediate their effects remain unknown.

Cigarette smoking and atherosclerosis

The pathogenesis and pathology of atherosclerosis have been the subject of many studies and reviews (Rose, 1985; Woolf, 1987). Within the realm of this paper rather than to note that there is still controversy as to what constitutes the earliest lesion of the disease, and that the fibro-lipid plaque may develop by a variety of routes (Haust, 1971; Woolf, 1987), Rose (1985) has proposed a response to injury hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This takes account of recent experimental evidence. Two main pathways form the basis of this hypothesis and one of these or a variation of it may be important in relation to cigarette smoking as well as diabetes and hypertension. It is hypothesized that direct stimulation of keratin may result in increased growth factors promoting the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells which in themselves may also release growth factors on stimulation (Rose, 1985).

Vascular endothelium has been the subject of many reviews

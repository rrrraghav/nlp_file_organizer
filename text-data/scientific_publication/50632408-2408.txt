We have identified a serum-responsive, cardiac tissue-specific transcription factor, BBF-1, that recognizes an
AT-rich sequence (element B), identical to the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) site, in the myosin
light chain-2 (MLC-2) promoter. Deletion of the element B sequence alone from the cardiac MLC-2
genes, a marked reduction of transcription. BBF-1 is distinguishable from MEF-2 by its ability to
immunoprecipitate with an antibody which recognizes MEF-2 but not BBF-1. Unlike MEF-2, BBF-1 is
present exclusively in heart extracts and does not bind to the MEF-2 consensus sequence. The basis
of this difference lies in the removal of serum from culture medium abolishes BBF-1 activity selectively with a
concomitant loss of MLC-2 gene transcription. This suggests that BBF-1 and MLC-2 gene transcription, indicating that
site) sequence. The loss of element B-mediated activation of MLC-2 gene transcription is reversed following the refeeding
of cells with serum-containing medium. We have also identified a second protein, MEF-2B, which binds to the same target site but that, unlike MEF-2, it does not interact
with cardiac tissue extracts. BBF-1 and MEF-2B appear to be a crucial member of the family of
proteins which serve as important tool in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying
cardiogenic differentiation.

The expression of cardiac muscle genes during myogene-
sis is influenced by a plethora of factors, including serum (13,
17), growth factors (15, 20), and hormones (1, 19). It is
currently hypothesized that these external stimuli act
through an intracellular signaling pathway which results in
the activation of transcription of cardiac muscle genes.
Several lines of evidence suggest that a class of nuclear
proteins plays a critical role in this process. These proteins
bind to specific DNA sequences within the promoter regions
of cardiac muscle genes and either enhance or repress their
transcription (2, 4, 6, 11, 18).

Myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) is an essential component
of the contractile apparatus of vertebrate skeletal and
cardiac muscle (9, 21). The MLC-2 gene contains several
cis acting elements in its promoter region that regulate its
expression during development (7, 10, 14). One such
element, designated MEF-2 site, has been shown to mediate
the induction of the MLC-2 gene by serum (7). The MEF-2
site is also present in the promoters of other cardiac muscle
genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (5), and its
function is thought to be widespread (3).

In this study, we describe an activator element(s) underlying
cardiac tissue-specific MLC gene transcription. This
element has been designated element B, which is imprinted
in the cardiac tissue upon entry T protein. A 41-kilodalton
nuclear protein, termed BBF-1 (Brooklyn Binding Factor 1),
specifically recognizes element B. We show that BBF-1
activity is dependent on serum and that it plays a crucial
role in regulating MLC-2 gene transcription in cardiac
muscle cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plasmid Constructions. The region of the human MLC-2
promoter used in this study was obtained by PCR using
primers based on the published sequence (7). The full-length
MLC-2 cDNA was used as a template for the PCR reaction.
The amplified DNA fragment, containing nucleotides -148 to +39
relative to the transcription start site, was cloned into the
EcoRI site of the plasmid pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene).
Various deletion mutants of the MLC-2 promoter were
constructed by sequential digestions with restriction enzymes
followed by ligation.

Transfection Assays. Cardiomyoblast cultures were
transfected with plasmids containing the luciferase reporter
gene under the control of the various MLC-2 promoter
constructs as described previously (7). The amount of
luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection
using a luminometer.

Immunoprecipitation and Gel Retardation Assays.
Nuclear extracts were prepared from adult rabbit heart tissue
and cultured rat cardiomyoblasts as described previously (7).
B-galactosidase gel retardation assays were performed as
described by Stillings et al. (16), using synthetic oligonucleotides
containing the MEF-2 site or element B sequence.

RESULTS

Identification of a Serum-Responsive Transcription Factor
That Recognizes Element B in the MLC-2 Promoter

During an attempt to identify factors that bind to the
MEF-2 site in the MLC-2 promoter, we observed a protein
that bound specifically to element B but not to the MEF-2
consensus sequence. This protein was found only in heart
tissue extracts and was dependent on serum.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from rabbit heart tissue (lane 1) and rat cardiomyoblasts cultured in serum-containing medium (lane 2) or serum-free medium (lane 3). The extracts were incubated with synthetic oligonucleotides containing either the MEF-2 site (A) or element B (B).

Figure 2. Deletion analysis of the MLC-2 promoter reveals that element B is required for serum-induced transcription. A plasmid containing the full-length MLC-2 promoter was digested with various restriction enzymes to generate deletion mutants, which were then transfected into rat cardiomyoblasts. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. The data are normalized to the amount of DNA transfected and expressed as a percentage of the luciferase activity observed with the full-length promoter.

Rat cardiomyoblasts were cultured in serum-containing medium, and then the medium was changed to serum-free medium for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared at various times after removal of serum from the culture medium and assayed for BBF-1 activity by gel retardation assay using the synthetic oligonucleotide containing element B as a probe.

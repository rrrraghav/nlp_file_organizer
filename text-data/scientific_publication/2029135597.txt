SUMMARY—Dose-response curves depicting the tumor-
initiating abilities of the powerful carcinogen 7,12-di-
methylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and the suspected weak
carcinogen or noncarcinogen benz[a]anthracene
(BA), applied to Charles River CD-1 female mice, revealed
that a single topical application of DMBA (8, 16, 32,
64, or 200 mmoles DMBA) 1 week later by twice weekly
applications of 0.5% croton oil induced 8, 16, 32, 64,
and 66 papillomas per mouse, respectively, at
24 weeks. A single application of 8, 16, or 200 mmoles
DMBA followed by twice weekly applications of 17µmoles
12,0-tetradecenylacetate (TPA) produced 3, 5, and 26 papillomas per mouse at 24 weeks after
promotion. When DMBA was applied in amounts of 1, 2,
4, 8, or 16 mmoles/mouse followed by twice weekly
applications of 0.5% TPA, the mice developed 2, 1, 0,
and 0 papillomas per mouse at 15 weeks after initiation.
A single dose of 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mmoles BA followed by twice weekly
applications of 0.5% TPA induced 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
papillomas per mouse at 24 weeks after promotion.

Results suggested that even a low-carcinogenic
compound like BA, when combined with tumor-
promotion may have either initiating or promoting
activities but can never elicit skin tumorigenesis
when applied as a single dose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

BA (98% pure) was obtained from Aldrich
Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.) and dissolved in
flowable chloromethane in pentane ether
(DMBA), supplied by Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
Mo.), was used as received. Croton oil was ob-
tained from S. B. Prnick and Co. (Boston, Mass.).
12,0-Tetradecenylacetate (TPA) was prepared as previously described (10) and purified by
preparative thin-layer chromatography. Charles River
CD-1 female mice, 6 weeks old, were received from
Charles River Mouse Farms (North Wilmington,
Del.). The animals were housed in a room 2 days
before treatment, and groups of 30 mice were used
in each experiment. All treatments were ap-
pliesd in 0.5 ml all axillary with an automatic gun.
The injection of DMBA was administered in
a 0.1 ml volume. DMBA and BA were prepared
immediately before use; the croton oil and TPA were
prepared in stock solutions and kept in a freezer.

RESULTS

DMBA treatment followed by tumor-
promotion resulted in significantly more (p < .01)
papillomas than did BA treatment followed by
tumor-promotion (Figs. 2 and 3). The dose-re-
sponse curves for DMBA initiation were sigmoidal,
whereas the dose-response curve for BA initiation
was linear.

The tumor incidence was significantly higher (p < .01)
in mice treated with DMBA followed by TPA pro-
motion than in those treated with BA followed by
TPA promotion (Figs. 2 and 3). The number of
papillomas per mouse also was significantly greater
(p < .01) in the DMBA-initiated group than in the
BA-initiated group.

DISCUSSION

The results of this study indicate that DMBA is a
powerful initiator of skin tumors in mice, whereas BA
is only a weak initiator. The tumor-promoting ac-
tivity of TPA is well established (13). It appears that
DMBA can initiate tumors at very low doses, and
that the initiating activity of BA is much lower than
that of DMBA.

The fact that BA could not elicit skin tumorigenesis
when applied as a single dose suggests that it may
have either initiating or promoting activities but can
never elicit skin tumorigenesis when applied as a
single dose.

transients in RBL-2H3 cells. J. Biol. Chem. 263 (1988) 32: C786–C792.—To investigate the basis of interactions
between nerves and mast cells, we tested the actions of the
neuropeptide substance P (SP) on whole cell current character-
istics of RBL-2H3 cells (homologous to mucosal mast cells).
Control RBL-2H3 cells showed a transient, repetitive increase
in current amplitude, which at a membrane potential
of 0 mV was 18 ± 4.5 nA (n = 6) compared with 9 ± 2.7 nA (n = 6) after SP applica-
tion compared with -6.8 ± 1.7 pA for control. This response
was characterized by a rapid onset and a duration of
approximately 30 s. Seventeen percent of the cells showed spontaneous transients in the current
amplitude from the beginning of the recording. After SP admin-
istration, the amplitude of these transients increased by 6.3 ±
2.0 fold. Responses to SP were mimicked by the application of
compound 1018 (a synthetic analog of substance K) and were blocked
by pretreatment with a dose of removal of derex. A dose of
1.0 μM SP (10−6 M) caused transient, repetitive increases
in current amplitude, which at a membrane potential
of 0 mV was 18 ± 4.5 nA (n = 6) compared with 9 ± 2.7 nA (n = 6) after SP applica-
tion compared with -6.8 ± 1.7 pA for control. This response

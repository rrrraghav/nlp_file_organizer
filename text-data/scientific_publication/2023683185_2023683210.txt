1. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

Any attempt to elucidate the biological bases of the responses of animals or humans to odorant must take into account at least one apparent pathway in addition to olfactory. The evidence for the importance of nonolfactory pathways in the perception of odors was reviewed by Tucker (1963b, 1971), Silver and Maruniak (1981), and Keverne et al. (1986). In all vertebrates some branches of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve respond to odorants. In some species a septal organ (accessory olfactory) system must also be considered. There has been little investigation of the possible role of this system in the behavioral responses to odorants. It is not present in all adult birds, but is the primary sensory structure in many, although it is found in amphibians, reptiles, and several mammalian orders (see Wysocki, 1979, for a review of the phylogenetic distribution of the vo- meronasal system). As discussed by Silver and Maruniak (1981), there is much speculation concerning the role of the septal organ of Masera and the terminal nerve in the response to odorants, but little direct evidence

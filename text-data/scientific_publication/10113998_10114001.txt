SUMMARY

Breast fluid which bathes the mammary ductal epithelium may contain tumorigenic components.
In view of the number of tobacco components inhaled during smoking, it was of interest whether nicotine and its metabolites were present in this fluid. Fluid was obtained from the nipple from menstruating women who were smokers and non-smokers.
In smokers, nicotine and cotinine were detectable in the fluid 30 min after smoking.
Further analysis of breast fluid may give leads as to whether components present are related to breast carcinogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

It has been recently reported that breast fluid, which can be obtained from the nipple by aspiration [7], contains a higher concentration of estrogens and progesterone than does blood [1]. In non-lactating women, the prevalence of this fluid in different populations is associated with the incidence of breast cancer.
In view of the involvement of mammary ductal epithelial cells in the development of breast cancer and the possibility that tumorigenic components are present in breast fluid, it is essential to determine the presence of nicotine in this fluid. Because nicotine and its metabolite, cotinine, have been reported in blood [3] and amniotic fluid [8] and breast milk [2] in smokers, we were interested in determining whether they are also present in the breast fluid of smoking and non-smoking women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Thirteen healthy menstruating women, from whom 100 pl of breast fluid

ABSTRACT The herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine
kinase gene TK complements the defect in temperature-
sensitive mutants and in vitro constructed insertion dele-
tion mutants of the CDC8 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
The Herpes simplex virus enzyme acts as both a thymidylate
kinase and a thymidylate kinase (dTMP kinase). The later
activity is responsible for the complementation of the ts
thermosensitive cell mutants are deficient in dTMP kinase ac-
tivity at all temperatures. However, an integrative revertant,
cdc8-101, which survives at the nonpermissive temperature at
the restrictive temperature, exhibits thermo labile (dTMP KI)
kinase activity. The CDC8 product is the structural gene for
dTMP kinase, which engages an essential step in DNA pre-
cursor biosynthesis. Previously, it had been shown that the
DNA replication defect of cdc8 mutants could be bypassed by
the addition of deoxyribonucleic triphosphates to per-
meabilized cells. This apparent dependence can be explained
by complementing a multiprotein yeast DNA replication com-
plex with the CDC8 product.

Introduction

The gene 31 of bacteriophage T7 encodes an enzyme
known as thymidylate kinase (TK) (1, 2). This enzyme
catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxythymidine to form
deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), a crucial pre-
cursor for DNA synthesis. A temperature-sensitive allele,
cdc8-1, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is defective in dTMP
kinase activity (3, 4). The cdc8 mutants are also defec-
tive in DNA replication and fail to grow at the restrictive
temperature unless deoxyribonucleic triphosphates (dNTPs)
are added to the growth medium (3, 4). This phenotype
suggests that dTMP kinase activity is essential for DNA
replication. The cdc8 gene has been cloned and mapped
to chromosome VI (5). We have introduced a herpes sim-
plex virus type 1 TK gene into S. cerevisiae and shown
that it complements the defect in temperature-sensitive
cdc8 mutants and in vitro constructed insertion dele-
tion mutants of the CDC8 gene.

Materials and Methods

Strains and media. All yeast strains employed are S.
cerevisiae and are listed in Table 1. All yeast cultures
were grown in synthetic medium (5) which was backdiluted
more than eight times to A660. Standard genetic methods were
used [19]. Transformations were performed on whole
cells using lithium acetate (21), PEG, or electroporation
and proper media have been described (22, 23). Herpes TK
activity in yeast was measured as described in ref. 14.
Herpes TK gene construction. The T K-6-kbose (tkb)
EcoRI fragment containing the tkS* gene in plasmid
pMB8 [14] was subcloned into the EcoRI site of plasmid
YEP25 (23) by employing standard recombinant DNA method-
ology (24). The resulting plasmid, pRS24, contains two
Spel sites, one in the pBR322 intergenic gene and the other
located 118 base pairs from the herpes simplex virus
type 1 tk (HSV-1) coding sequence. pRS24 was par-
tially digested with Dral and ligated to a BamHI fragment
from plasmid pRS10 [25] which contains a yeast centromere
agregation got electrophoresis (26). The DNA 4 KB site of
agregated plasmids was subcloned into the SalI site of
plasmid YEp12 (27) to generate YEP12RS. A similar pro-
cedure was used to construct YEP12RS/TK, in which the tkb
EcoRI fragment from plasmid pRS24 was inserted between
the BamHI and EcoRI sites of plasmid YEP12.

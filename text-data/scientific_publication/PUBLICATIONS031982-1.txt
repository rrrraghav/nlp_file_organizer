ABSTRACT

Because kinins affect vascular tone, it is assumed that kinins
act directly on smooth muscle. However, a direct interaction is
difficult to conceive. Vessels containing smooth muscle are lined
by a continuous endothelium tight junctions. In addition,
kinins act on endothelial cells to cause the release of prostag-
landin-related substances, possibly through receptors. Further-
more, endothelial cells have a great capacity for hydrolyzing
kinins to inactive products. Hence, even assuming active transport,
less than 1% of kinins might be expected to reach the first layer
of smooth muscle cells. However, kinins may act directly on
smooth muscle as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells from
the walls of pulmonary arterioles, that smooth muscle cells send
large numbers of projections into the cytoplasm of the endothelial
cells. In addition, smooth muscle cells attach directly to the
abluminal surface of endothelial cells, as do pericytes. Thus,
there is a morphological basis by which kinins can affect tone in
smooth muscle without acting directly on smooth muscle cells.

INTRODUCTION

Although kinins and angiotensin are classified as hormones
that affect smooth muscle, it is by no means clear how these hor-
mones interact with smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, there are
circumstances in which it is difficult to conceive of means by
which, e.g., bradykinin can reach smooth muscle cells in order to
exert an effect. Thus, bradykinin infused intravenously can dilate

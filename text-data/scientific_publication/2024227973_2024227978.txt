ABSTRACT

In order to explore the correlation between parents’
smoking habits and bronchial asthma in children, we
undertook a cross-sectional study of 3300 (54% males,
46% females) school children aged 7-12 years old. A
survey of smoking habits and attitudes conducted in Saudi
Arabia showed a positive correlation between parental
smoking and asthma. The frequency of respiratory
complaints, wheezing, and coughs were also higher among
children of smokers. It appears that evidence is accumu-
lating that there is a relationship between parental smok-
ing and respiratory symptoms in Saudi children.

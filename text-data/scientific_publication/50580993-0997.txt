Abstract. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a common model for studying biological processes, but
descriptions of its microcirculatory system are lacking. We studied the CAM structure and the three-dimensional spatial configuration of the
CAM vessels using five methods: in vivo stereoscopic observations, whole mount preparations, histological sections, corrosion cast
corrosion cast impregnation techniques, and wax enrobing of a three-dimensional wax model. Our findings show that the CAM consists of a superficial two-dimensional layer composed of a network of a very dense capillary mesh,
floating over an underlying deeper three-dimensional space in which medium and larger vessels are seen to
supply and drain the superficial layer. It is interesting to note that no pit or sprouts of blood vessels were observed
during the development of the CAM vessels. In a shell-less egg preparation, the capillaries were found in the
mesoderm of the CAM and not in superficial to the ectoderm as in the case of the CAM of the intact egg which
adheres to the shell membrane.

Introduction

The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay is a common method for studying biological processes such as angiogenesis [1, 2], wound repair [3], transplant experiments [4] and for the assessment of angiogenic activity [5].
The CAM is formed on day 6 by fusion of the somatic mesoderm of the embryo with the extraembryonic membranes. The CAM spreads over the yolk sac on day 8 and covers it completely.

By day 10, the CAM is a highly vascularized membrane with a rich supply of blood vessels. The flow of blood to and from the yolk sac enables the easy observation of the circulatory system [6].
The purpose of this study was to describe the three-dimensional structure of the CAM microvasculature using several techniques.

Materials and Methods

Chick embryos were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C with a 12 h light/dark cycle. The eggs were obtained from a commercial supplier (e.g., Meyer Hatchery, PA).
The following methods were used to study the CAM: 1) In vivo stereoscopic observations; 2) Whole mount preparations; 3) Histological sections; 4) Corrosion cast impregnation techniques; and 5) Wax enrobing of a three-dimensional wax model.

1) In vivo Stereoscopic Observations
The eggs were observed in vivo using a stereomicroscope (Zeiss, Jena, GDR). The CAM was visualized through the shell membrane.

2) Whole Mount Preparations
Whole mount preparations were made as described by Ross and Folkman [6]. Briefly, the eggshell was opened carefully and the CAM was removed with fine forceps. The CAM was then placed in a petri dish containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and photographed.

3) Histological Sections
The eggs were fixed in Bouin’s solution for 24 h. The CAM was removed and sectioned at 5 μm thickness using a rotary microtome. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

4) Corrosion Cast Impregnation Techniques
Corrosion cast impregnation techniques were performed as described by Popa et al. [7]. Briefly, the eggs were fixed in Bouin’s solution for 24 h. The CAM was removed and injected with a mixture of colored latex (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI) and silicone rubber (NuSil Silicone, Scranton, PA). The eggs were then immersed in a saturated sodium hydroxide solution for 24-48 h to dissolve the tissues. The corrosion casts were washed with distilled water and photographed.

5) Wax Enrobing of a Three-Dimensional Wax Model
The CAM was removed from the egg and placed in a petri dish containing PBS. A mixture of molten paraffin wax (melting point 56°C) and beeswax (melting point 63°C) in a ratio of 2:1 was poured over the CAM. The wax was allowed to cool and solidify. The wax enrobing was then sectioned at 10 μm thickness using a razor blade. The sections were photographed.

Results

The CAM is composed of a superficial two-dimensional layer, which is supported by an underlying three-dimensional space (Figs. 1-4). The superficial layer consists of a network of capillaries that are closely packed together. The capillaries in the superficial layer are approximately 10-20 μm in diameter. The deeper layer contains larger vessels, such as veins and arteries. These vessels are approximately 50-100 μm in diameter.

The CAM is highly vascularized, with a large number of capillaries per unit area. The density of capillaries varies depending on the location on the CAM. The capillaries are more densely packed in areas where there is high metabolic activity, such as near the yolk sac and the embryo.

The CAM vessels undergo a sequence of structural changes. During the rapid phase of endomitotic mitosis within the preexiting capillaries, the CAM is expanding [8, 9].

There is some controversy regarding the real nature of the CAM capillary network. Narbitts [10] described the CAM vascular architecture as a single blood vessel not as a network of capillaries or canals connected to floor with supporting cylindrical columns—which appears to be
the case in our preparations. The superficial layer of capillaries or surface of a single blood vessel is the most relevant point if the CAM is used for angiogenesis studies [1].

The results which can be clearly understood during the development of the CAM are: 1) The CAM vessels appear early in the embryo; 2) The CAM vessels grow rapidly; and 3) The CAM vessels undergo a sequence of structural changes. During the rapid phase of endomitotic mitosis within the preexiting capillaries, the CAM is expanding [8, 9].

Discussion

The CAM is a valuable model for studying angiogenesis and other biological processes. The CAM is easy to obtain and manipulate, and it has a rich supply of blood vessels.

TO A NICOTINE NIGHTINGALE

“I’ve been thinking a lot lately,” she observed in a low, husky tone, “about the whole concept of assisted suicide.” She paused, took a long drag from her cigarette, and exhaled a plume of smoke that momentarily obscured her face. “It seems to me that if a person is suffering irremediably, they should have the right to choose how and when their life ends.”

I nodded slowly, trying to appear thoughtful while simultaneously wondering whether she was about to ask me to help her kick the bucket. After all, this was Beatrice—a woman who chain-smoked three packs of Marlboro Lights a day, subsisted almost entirely on black coffee and biscotti, and whose general demeanor suggested a profound dissatisfaction with the universe.

“Of course,” she continued, “there are all sorts of complications. What if the person isn’t competent to make that decision? What if they’re being pressured by family members or unscrupulous doctors?”

“Those are valid concerns,” I conceded.

“And what about the slippery slope argument?” she mused. “If we legalize assisted suicide, won’t it inevitably lead to a situation where vulnerable people are essentially coerced into ending their lives?”

I had no idea how to respond to that one. Beatrice was good at posing questions that didn’t have easy answers. It was one of the things I found both fascinating and frustrating about her.

“Still,” she said, tapping ash into a crystal ashtray, “I can’t help but feel that there’s something inherently compassionate about allowing people to control their own destinies, even if those destinies involve choosing death.”

She fixed me with an intense gaze, and I couldn’t help but wonder whether she was subtly testing my moral compass. Or perhaps she was just bored and looking for someone to bounce her philosophical musings off of.

REPLY FROM THE EDITOR

We appreciate the thoughtful article “To a Nicotine Nightingale.” It is refreshing to see such a frank and honest discussion of a topic that is often shrouded in secrecy and taboo. We encourage our readers to consider the ethical and moral implications of assisted suicide and to engage in respectful dialogue with those who hold different views.

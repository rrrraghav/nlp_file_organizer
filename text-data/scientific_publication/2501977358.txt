The aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated
events on the genotoxicity of mainstream cigarette smoke
condensate were investigated. The AhR is a cytoplasmic
transcription factor that binds with a dioxin-responsive
element and regulates gene expression. Cigarette smoke is
capable of inducing AhR activation, suggesting it is
able to transform AHR to an active form which could
stimulate transcription. Micronuclei formation in
CHO/AhR cells exposed to cigarette smoke condensate
and cigarette smoke condensate was observed to induce a
significant increase in micronuclei relative to
CHO/AhR cells, which express >100 fold less AhR.
Further, the induction of micronuclei was dependent
when CHO/AhR cells were pretreated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent AhR agonist.
The results demonstrate that cigarette smoke condensate
is capable of inducing AhR-mediated genotoxicity.
Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture containing over
4000 chemicals. It is composed of readily 4000 chemicals, and it
thought to contribute to >30% of cancers in the USA (1–4).
Some of the toxins found in cigarette smoke, such as polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, are procarcinogens. These compounds require metabolic activation to become metabolically activated to genotoxic intermediates (5). The metabolism
of these compounds involves cytochrome P450
enzymes, including a number of cytochrome cP450
isozymes, such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, which are under the
regulation of others and other drug metabolizing enzymes may
also be involved. These enzymes can also induce the expression of
other aromatic cigarette smoke constituents such as benzo[a]py-
rene (B[a]P) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-1,4-dihydrobenzodioxin
(TCDD) electrophiles (6–12).

It has been established that cigarette smoke upregulates
expression of a number of genes through the aromatic
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Upon ligand binding, the AhR
translocates to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with
the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor-mediated proteins (ARs)
and binds to specific DNA sequences known as dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) and RREs gene transcribing
various genes including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. The AhR is
expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including lung, liver,
kidney, and immune cells (13–16). Cigarette smoke exposure
has been shown to induce AhR expression in human bronchial
epithelial cells (17) and in mouse lung tissue (18). The AhR
is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (19–21).

In this study, we investigated the role of AhR-mediated
events on the genotoxicity of cigarette smoke condensate. We
hypothesized that cigarette smoke condensate would induce
micronuclei formation in CHO/AhR cells, and that this effect
would be dependent on AhR expression and TCDD pretreatment.

Materials and Methods

Cell Culture

CHO/AhR cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD).
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.

Cigarette Smoke Condensate Preparation

Cigarette smoke condensate was prepared as previously described
(22). Briefly, a smoking machine (Teague Engineering) was used
to smoke five reference cigarettes (R1 Research Cigarettes,
University of Kentucky) per liter of air. The air stream was
passed through a series of impingers containing 20 mL of
sterile distilled water. The combined impinger fluid was
concentrated under reduced pressure to yield cigarette smoke
condensate. The final concentration of the condensate was
adjusted to 1 mg/mL in serum-free medium.

Results

Cigarette Smoke Condensate Induces Micronuclei Formation in
CHO/AhR Cells

To determine whether cigarette smoke condensate induces
micronuclei formation, CHO/AhR cells were exposed to various
concentrations of cigarette smoke condensate (0–10 μg/mL) for
24 h. The number of micronuclei per cell was then counted. As
shown in Figure 1A, exposure to cigarette smoke condensate
induced a significant increase in micronuclei formation relative
to control cells (P < 0.05). The maximum induction of
micronuclei occurred at a concentration of 10 μg/mL.

then exposed to 10 μg/mL cigarette smoke condensate for an
additional 24 h. The number of micronuclei per cell was then
counted. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3). *P < 0.05
compared to control.

TCDD Pretreatment Attenuates Cigarette Smoke Condensate-Induced
Micronuclei Formation

To determine whether the induction of micronuclei by cigarette
smoke condensate is dependent on AhR expression, CHO/AhR
cells were pretreated with TCDD (1 nM) for 24 h, then exposed
to 10 μg/mL cigarette smoke condensate for an additional 24 h.
As shown in Figure 1B, pretreatment with TCDD significantly
attenuated the induction of micronuclei by cigarette smoke
condensate (P < 0.05).

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate that cigarette smoke
condensate is capable of inducing AhR-mediated genotoxicity.
This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that
cigarette smoke can activate the AhR and induce expression of
genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism (17, 18). The induction
of micronuclei by cigarette smoke condensate suggests that this
compound may be contributing to the increased risk of cancer
associated with cigarette smoking.

The attenuation of cigarette smoke condensate-induced
micronuclei formation by TCDD pretreatment further supports
the role of AhR in mediating the genotoxic effects of cigarette
smoke condensate. TCDD is a potent AhR agonist that binds to
the AhR and promotes its translocation to the nucleus, where it
heterodimerizes with ARs and binds to DREs. Pretreatment
with TCDD may saturate the available AhR, preventing cigarette
smoke condensate from binding to the receptor and initiating the
genotoxic cascade.

The mechanisms by which cigarette smoke condensate induces
micronuclei formation are not fully understood. However, it is
possible that cigarette smoke condensate contains compounds that
directly damage DNA or interfere with DNA repair processes.
Alternatively, cigarette smoke condensate may induce oxidative
stress, leading to DNA damage. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cigarette smoke
condensate induces micronuclei formation.

Conclusion

This study provides evidence that cigarette smoke condensate is
capable of inducing AhR-mediated genotoxicity. This finding
suggests that the AhR may play a role in the pathogenesis of
cigarette smoking-related diseases, including cancer. Further
research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which
cigarette smoke condensate induces micronuclei formation and
to identify potential targets for intervention.

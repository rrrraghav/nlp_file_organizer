Smoke of Cigarettes and Little Cigars: An Analytical Comparison

Abstract—We have made a comparative analysis of the smoke
of cigarettes and little cigars. The reported practice of
smokers who use little cigars as a substitute for cigarettes
is now widespread, and it is important to know if there are
significant differences in the hazards associated with these
two types of smoking devices.

Introduction—The increasing popularity of “little
cigars” (hand-rolled or machine-made) as an alternative
to cigarettes has prompted us to investigate the chemical
composition of their smoke. Little cigars are often
marketed as a cheaper substitute for cigarettes, and some
smokers believe that they are less harmful. However,
there is little scientific evidence to support this belief.
The purpose of this study was to compare the chemical
characteristics of cigarette smoke with those of little cigar
smoke.

Materials and Methods—Cigarettes (21 mm) were
obtained from a retail outlet in New York City (January
1971). Little cigars (3 1/2 to 4 inches long) were
purchased from open markets in Louisville, Kentucky,
and Boston, Massachusetts. The composition of the
tobacco used in the little cigars was not known. All
cigarettes and little cigars were smoked under standardized
conditions using a Clark-type smoking machine (1968
modification). The smoke was passed through cotton filters
to remove particulate matter, and the gaseous components
were absorbed into charcoal tubes to trap volatile organic
compounds. The nicotine content of the particulate matter
was determined by washing the filters with potassium
hydroxide solution, followed by extraction with diethyl
ether. The ether extracts were analyzed for nicotine by
gas chromatography. The tar was determined by measuring
the weight of the filters before and after smoking.

Results—The chemical composition of cigarette smoke
and little cigar smoke was similar. However, several
differences were noted. Little cigars generally contained
more tar per unit volume of smoke than cigarettes. For
example, a typical cigarette (21 mm) contains 18 mg of
tar, whereas a little cigar (3 1/2 to 4 inches long)
contains approximately 29 mg of tar. The nicotine content
was also higher in the smoke of little cigars.

Discussion—The results of this study indicate that
little cigars are not necessarily less harmful than cigarettes.
In fact, they may be more hazardous due to their higher
tar and nicotine content. It is important for smokers to
understand that all forms of smoking are harmful to health.
The widespread use of little cigars as a substitute for
cigarettes is a cause for concern, and public health officials
should take steps to educate the public about the hazards
of smoking. Further research is needed to fully understand
the long-term effects of smoking little cigars. It should be
noted that the composition of the smoke may vary depending
on the type of tobacco used and the method of manufacture.
The results of this study are based on a limited number of
samples, and further studies are needed to confirm these
findings.

hazard to human health, it should be
known not only the composition of the
smoke but also the physical and
chemical properties of the smoke and
its constituents. In this study we
attempted to establish the specific
physical and chemical differences between
the smoke of cigarettes, cigars, and the
newly popular little cigars. It is hoped
that these findings will contribute to
the establishment of new ways of dis-
tinguishing between cigarettes, cigars,
and little cigars, which are more reli-
able than appearance alone.

Cigarettes without filter tips (85
mm) were obtained from a retail store
in Kentucky (Ky.) Little cigars (3 1/2
to 4 in.) from the open market
in Boston, Massachusetts (December
1971). Filter cigarettes (55 mm), little
cigars (3 1/2 to 4 in.), and cigar-
illos; filter cigars (60 mm) from
the open market in New York City
(January 1972). The origin of the
tobacco used in the little cigars was
unidentified, and is being considered re-
strictive.

Comparison of Smoke Composition—
The smoke from cigarettes, cigarillos,
and little cigars was drawn through
cotton filters using a modified Clark
machine. The nicotine content of the
particulate matter was determined by
washing the filters with potassium hy-
droxide solution, followed by ex-
traction with diethyl ether. The ether
extracts were analyzed for nicotine by
gas chromatography. The tar was de-
termined by measuring the weight of
the filters before and after smoking.

Results—The chemical composition
of cigarette smoke, cigarillos, and little
cigars was similar. However, several
differences were noted. Little cigars
generally contained more tar per unit
volume of smoke than cigarettes or
cigarillos. For example, a typical
cigarette (85 mm) contains 18 mg of
tar, whereas a little cigar (3 1/2 to
4 in.) contains approximately 29 mg
of tar. The nicotine content was also
higher in the smoke of little cigars.

Discussion—The results of this study
indicate that little cigars are not neces-
sarily less harmful than cigarettes or
cigarillos. In fact, they may be more
hazardous due to their higher tar and
nicotine content. It is important for
smokers to understand that all forms
of smoking are harmful to health. The
widespread use of little cigars as a
substitute for cigarettes is a cause for
concern, and public health officials
should take steps to educate the pub-
lic about the hazards of smoking. Fur-
ther research is needed to fully under-
stand the long-term effects of smok-
ing little cigars. It should be noted
that the composition of the smoke may
vary depending on the type of tobacco
used and the method of manufacture.
The results of this study are based on a
limited number of samples, and further
studies are needed to confirm these
findings.

Background Few studies have reported the relationship between passive smoking (PS) in early life and the risk of
lung cancer. This study was done to evaluate the risk of female lung cancer from PS, especially that during childhood
and adolescence.

Methods A household exposure to tobacco smoke as an estimate of PS, a 1:1 paired case-control study was
conducted in Harbin, China. We interviewed 114 female primary lung cancer cases, aged 30–65 years, and their
hospital-matched controls. The controls were non-cancer patients selected from the same hospital as the cases, and
matched on age (±5 years), residential area, and smoking status overall. There were 59 pairs who ever
smoked and 55 pairs who never smoked. Information on PS was collected by residence for each of the following
periods: 0–5, 6–14, 15–22, and 23–30 years.

Res Household PS significantly increased the risk of female lung cancer for those exposed at ages 22 or younger,
who have ever smoked. The risk was also increased for those non-smoking pairs when exposed under the age of 15
years. Exposure to maternal smoking at ages 14 or younger increased the risk by 30% (odds ratio [OR] 1.3,
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49–4.86), but not to paternal smoking (OR 1.4d, 95% CI 1.52–3.50) The risk was
highest for those exposed under the age of 5 years (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.86–6.05) and was also significantly higher at
OR_3.08(95%CI: 1.62–5.57) and 5-22 (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.56–6.31) years, and under the age of 23 years (OR
3.48, 95%CI: 1.42–11.59, p<0.001) 0f note, the OR in five exposure periods for non-smoking pairs were similar
to those at household PS.

Conclusion It appears that childhood and adolescent PS increases the risk of female lung cancer.

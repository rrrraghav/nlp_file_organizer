Central and Peripheral Effects of Amitriptyline and Eryptamine

Recent interest has centered on the mode of action of the new antidepressive drugs. The impression has developed that endogenous catecholamines and/or serotonin are responsible for the clinical actions, although such agents often have amphetamine-like structures and actions that are more impressive than their MAOI properties. That is the case with eryptamine, which is also chemically related to serotonin as is shown in the first slide. That an effective antidepressive drug need not have MAOI actions is illustrated by amitriptyline which is obviously related to impramine.

If we extend our concept of antidepressants to the more general class of alerting agents, to include amphetamine-like and atropine-like molecules, we would have to conclude that there is some tendency for a certain type of alertness to be favored by substances which resemble or enhance the actions of endogenous aromatic alkylamines, or to reduce the activity of endogenous cholinergic systems.

It is our impression from previous research with impramine that in general it is not sufficient for a drug to act upon a single modulator mechanism to produce selective psychopharmacologic effects. Blockade or stimulation of a single modulator system may give behavioral effects but only at the expense of neurological side effects, not to mention the peripheral consequences of disruption of particular mediator mechanisms. On the other hand, a suitable pattern of multiple central modulator actions properly chosen might have selective psychiatric actions with a minimum of neurological and peripheral effects.

Specifically, we feel that the combination of anticholinergic, proserogenic and proptryptamergic effects may explain the antidepressive action of impramine, while none of these effects by itself can account for its clinical action.

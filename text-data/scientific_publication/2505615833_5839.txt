Summary. Forty subjects were exposed to cigarette smoke produced by a smoking machine in a climatic chamber. The change in air pollution due to particulate matter, NO and NO2 was measured. The concentration of irritants (formaldehyde, acrolein, ammonia) and eye irritating substances were determined. All subjects reported annoyance and eye irritation. Annoyance in the range between 2.1 and 4.0 on a visual analogue scale was found.
Key words: Passive smoking - Eye Irritation - Particulate matter - irritants - Ammonia - NO2 - Treshold limit values

Introduction

The effect of passive smoke on health have not been completely settled. However, several lines are considering the possibility of respiratory illnesses in children whose parents smoke [1, 2]. The risk of illness is increased for children with asthma or other bronchial diseases [3, 4] and for people who have allergies [5]. Children of smokers are also at a higher risk to develop bronchitis [6, 7].
Passive smoking can either worsen or produce a prevalence of the illness [1, 5].

Smoke will announce acute irritation of the eyes and respiratory passages as well as annoyance due to odours [8, 9] and severe symptoms [10]. Some studies suggest that passive smoking could show an increased risk of lung cancer in non-smokers [11]. It is reported that the risk of lung cancer is higher with foundations. It is assumed that the cumulative exposure to passive smoke is greater than the risk of the disease. These results need, however, not be confirmed by the American epidemiological study of Garfinkel [12] Furthermore, for Lehnert [13] the ap-

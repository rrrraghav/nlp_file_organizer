The Role of Charged Residues in Determining Transmembrane
Protein Orientation in Insertion*

The first 79 residues of the yeast Ste2p G protein-
coupled pheromone receptor, including the negatively
charged N-terminal domain, the transmembrane
region, and the following positively charged cytoplas-
mic loop, has been fused to a Renilla luciferase refrac-
tory mutant. The resulting fusion construct was analyzed
by analysis of cell-associated and secreted β-lactamase ac-
tivity and by immunolabeling for membrane association.
Membrane association and glycosylation patterns. This
fusion protein, with an N-terminal transmembrane
(N….) topology, serving as a model type III membrane
protein. Orientation is unaffected by removal of all
three positively charged residues in the cytoplasmic
loop or by deletion of all but 12 residues from the N-
terminal domain. The resulting construct apparently provides an signal sufficient to determine
topology. This observation supports a rule derived
from the charge difference rule in which the charge difference,
ΔG(N-C), counted for the 15 immediately flanking resi-
dues, is the primary determinant of orientation. Mutations
altering ΔG(N-C) to zero favor N… insertion by 8 to 1,
whereas increasing positive charges promote inversion of orientation. All results are consistent with
the charge difference rule; that is, positively charged residues promote cytoplasmic retention, negative
charges promote translocation.

Neonatal Gastric Perforation Not

Caused by Congenital Muscular Defects

Cudley J. Priebe, Jr., MD; Towshe Magrath, MD; Ronald Garrel, MD

A rare case of a congenital gastric perforation in a newborn is reported. The perforation was associated with an unusual combination of congenital muscular defects, including absence of the pyloric sphincter, incomplete development of the lesser curvature, and multiple areas of muscular discontinuity. These findings suggest that this type of gastric perforation may be caused by generalized congenital muscular defects rather than by localized defects.

The most common gastrointestinal malformations are omphalocele and gastroschisis, which are associated with obstruction occurring at some distance from the defect. Von Stoedtner et al., in 1968, reported a case of gastric perforation associated with an omphalocele. Waisman et al., in 1965, described a newborn infant with a congenital muscular defect. However, it is rare to find a congenital gastric perforation associated with multiple areas of muscular defects. Herewith is the report of a case in which the patient exhibited this combination of defects.

Report of a Case

The infant was born at term by cesarean section following an uncomplicated pregnancy. The mother had no history of previous pregnancies or illnesses. Physical examination revealed a full-term male infant weighing 2,980 grams (6.5 lbs) and measuring 48 cm (19 inches) in length. There were no other apparent anomalies.

The diagnosis of gastric perforation was made immediately after birth when the infant developed respiratory distress and cyanosis. A small defect, approximately 1 cm in diameter, was noted on the anterior aspect of the stomach. The stomach appeared to be otherwise normal except for the absence of a pyloric sphincter and multiple areas of muscular discontinuity.

At laparotomy, the stomach was found to be rotated counterclockwise 270 degrees. There were multiple areas of muscular discontinuity throughout the stomach. The lesser curvature was incompletely developed. The esophagus and duodenum appeared normal.

The stomach was repaired primarily. A gastrostomy tube was placed into the stomach to provide drainage. The infant tolerated feedings well and recovered rapidly from surgery. He was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day.

Discussion

Congenital gastric perforations are rare. Most cases have been thought to have gastro muscular defects.

In 1958, in Bougueret is 1962, Land confirmed that thinning of the muscular wall and absence of muscularis were present in all of the specimens examined by him. A similar finding was reported by Waisman et al., who used a special staining technique to demonstrate abnormalities of the muscular layers. These authors described a case of gastric perforation with a congenital muscular gap, blistering, and areas of muscular discontinuity.

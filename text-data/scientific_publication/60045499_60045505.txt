Both Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Increase with Lesion Grade in Cervical
Neoplasia but Do Not Correlate with Human Papillomavirus Type*

Recent molecular studies suggest that the expression of high-risk but
not low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) counterparts E6 and E7 can
significantly alter normal cell cycle regulation. The alterations in cell cycle
regulation may be reflected by changes in the balance between cell growth
and cell loss through apoptosis in cell populations expressing E6 and/or
E7. We evaluated the kinetic indices of cell proliferation and apoptosis in
a series of cervical lesions ranging from low-grade dysplasia to high-grade
neoplasia, with HPV-associated lesions. The cell proliferation index, as
determined by detection of Ki-67, increased with increasing lesion grade. Apoptotic cells were identified with terminal
deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase labeling of the 3'-hydroxyl ends of DNA
nucleotides. Few apoptotic cells were seen in low-grade lesions; only
occasional apoptotic cells were seen in high-grade lesions. However, there
was a few but measurable apoptotic indices in the higher grade lesions,
which correlated with lesion grade. There was no significant difference in
the proliferative and apoptotic indices in similar grade lesions when
stratified into HPV-infected high-risk HPV types. These findings suggest that
apoptosis in HPV-infected lesions correlates with proliferative activity
rather than HPV type.

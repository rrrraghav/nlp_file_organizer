We have explored the structure and pattern of expression of a gene designated mdm-l, which is amplified 25-30-fold in transformed mouse cells contain-ing numerous double minute chromosomes. This gene is expressed in all mouse tissues examined at exhibits distinct patterns of tissue-specific expression. Multiple transcripts are generated from the mdm-l gene via mechanisms of alternative splicing and polyadenylation signal choice. These mRNAs have the potential to produce a minimum of three distinct pro-tein isoforms ranging in size from 27 to 35 kilodaltons. The antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide from the mdm-l gene was used in immunoblotting studies and revealed that at least one of the protein products is present in the nucleus. This antiserum stained nuclear structures producing a distinct punctate or speckled pattern.

A number of genes have been implicated in the early events following transformation. These include genes such as myc, raf-1, and erbB (references). The amplification of genes at the double minute chromosomes (DMS) is a common feature of many transformed cells (e.g., Lamb et al., 1979; Graf et al., 1981; Siminovitch et al., 1983). DMS contain multiple copies of one or more genes, which confer resistance to a number of other drugs, has pro-vided evidence that cells containing DMS must therefore be selected for and maintained in the population because the DMS contain amplified copies of one or more genes, which confers resistance to the cytotoxic agent. Removal of the drug eliminates selective pressure, resulting in rapid loss of DMS (Ali et al., 1978; Kaufman et al., 1979).

In contrast, DMS are stably maintained in tumor cells in the absence of obvious selective pressure. Therefore, it is likely that the amplified DNA on the DMS confers some growth advantage to the host cell. Indeed, amplified sequences present in a number of transformed cell lines often include previously characterized proto-oncogenes or re-lated genes (e.g., Graf et al., 1981). We posit that the am-plification and subsequent overexpression of particular genes may play a central role in some processes of transformation.

We are exploring the functional significance of amplified DNA sequences located on DMS in a spontaneously arisen Swiss mouse fibroblast cell line, designated 3T3SNE. Several cloned DMS have been isolated and characterized (George et al., 1984), including growth-related genes such as the c-raf gene (Graf et al., 1981) and a set of repetitive sequences (Zijlstra et al., 1982). We report here on the isolation and characterization of another gene amplified on a DMS in 3T3SNE cells, which we have designated mdm-l.

The mdm-l gene is amplified approximately 25-30-fold in 3T3SNE cells compared to normal mouse tissues. The amplified DNA comprises a 4.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment that hybridizes to a single band on Southern blots of genomic DNA from various mouse tissues. This suggests that the mdm-l gene is present as a single copy in the genome. The cloned mdm-l sequences were obtained from a genomic library of Balb/c mouse DNA (obtained from Dr. David A. Williams, University of California, San Francisco) using the amplified 4.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment as a probe.

The mdm-l gene is transcribed in all mouse tissues examined. Northern blot analysis revealed distinct patterns of tissue-specific expression (see Fig. 3). The most abundant transcripts are detected in liver and brain, with lower levels present in heart, lung, spleen, kidney, muscle, and embryo.

Multiple mRNA species are generated from the mdm-l gene via alternative splicing and polyadenylation signal choice (see Fig. 4). At least three distinct mRNAs have been identified, ranging in size from approximately 1.2 to 1.8 kilobases. The largest mRNA contains all six exons of the mdm-l gene, while the smaller mRNAs result from skipping one or two exons.

The mdm-l gene product is a nuclear protein with an estimated molecular weight of 30,000 daltons (see Fig. 5). An antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 248-267 of the predicted amino acid sequence recognized a band at approximately 30 kilodaltons in immunoblots of proteins from 3T3SNE cells. The mdm-l protein was also detected in nuclear extracts from normal mouse tissues, suggesting that it is normally expressed at low levels in these tissues.

The mdm-l protein has been localized to the nucleus by immunofluorescence microscopy (see Fig. 6). The staining produced a distinct punctate or speckled pattern, which suggests that the protein may be associated with chromatin or nuclear structures.

"Sudden unexpected death in women. Biologic and psychological origins."
(American Journal of Epidemiology 114/5: 671-672, November 1981)

"The relationship of the risk of sudden death from arteriosclerotic
heart disease to biologic and psychosocial factors was studied retrospectively
in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, in 80 white women who died from arterio-
sclerotic heart disease during March, 1977-October, 1978, and in 80 age-
matched neighborhood controls. All cases of sudden death in white women
aged 25-64 years who died outside the hospital within 24 hours of onset of
symptoms were ascertained. The overall autopsy rate was 63%. Detailed
postmortem examinations were conducted on 42 of 80 sudden cardiac cases.
Cases were more often heavy smokers and had fewer children than the control
population. Fifteen out of 80 women who died suddenly of heart disease
and three controls had a definite history of psychiatric disease. Cases
had more often experienced the death of a significant other within six
months prior to their demise. Multiple regression analysis showed that
cigarette smoking, psychiatric history and death of a significant other
contributed significantly to differences between women who died suddenly
and control women. Thirteen women died suddenly under the age of 45 years.
Six of the 13 deaths were due to arteriosclerotic heart disease. These
six women were all smokers, and four were currently taking oral contra-
ceptives or estrogen replacements."

Pulmonary Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylase: Tobacco Smoke-Exposed Guinea Pigs.
Blumenfeld, M. H., Johnson, McGill, J. C., Hooks, J. C., and Witzchuk, H. P. (1977). Tobacco Aryl
Hydroxylase (AHH) and cytochrome P450 were measured in guinea pigs exposed to tobacco smoke.
Activity of AHH in the lung is an early response to exposure to tobacco smoke.
The activity of AHH was measured 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hr after smoke exposure.
guinea pigs were exposed to tobacco smoke for 30 min daily for 5 days.
The increase in AHH activity was related to the amount of smoke inhaled per minute.
AHH activity was elevated in the lung of guinea pigs exposed to tobacco smoke.
Guinea pigs are more sensitive than rats to the effects of tobacco smoke.
The exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke results in regular increases in cortical adrene-
nal content and decreases in body weight. The increase in AHH activity is related to the
exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke. Guinea pigs exposed to tobacco smoke show
hydrolysis in the lung of guinea pigs 18 hr later, and Anisohlin 734 (500 mg/kg) administered
to these animals inhibits the formation of AHH. The administration of Anisohlin 734 also
did induce pulmonary AHH is late II to some other chemicals that were inhibitors of AHII.
The exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke results in increased levels of cortical adrene-
nal and decreased body weight. All these effects are related to the exposure of guinea pigs
to tobacco smoke, and may be useful for studies on chronic toxicological effects of
smoke and chronic toxic tolerance to smoke.

We chose to study the pulmonary aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) system as an
early indicator of the effect of xenobiotics on laboratory animals. The AHH system is
involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which are
present in cigarette smoke (1). We have previously shown that exposure of guinea pigs
to tobacco smoke results in regular increases in cortical adrene-nal content and decreases
in body weight (2). In order to investigate the relationship between these effects and
the induction of pulmonary AHH, we exposed guinea pigs to tobacco smoke for various
periods of time and measured AHH activity in the lung. We also investigated the effect
of Anisohlin 734 on the formation of AHH in animals exposed to tobacco smoke.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals. Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (Charles River, Montreal) weighing 250–350 g were used
in these studies. The animals were housed in individual cages and given ad libitum access to food and water.

Exposure to Tobacco Smoke. Guinea pigs were exposed to tobacco smoke in a modified Plethysmograph
chamber (3). The chamber was maintained at 22 ± 1°C and 50 ± 5% relative humidity. The animals
were exposed to unfiltered cigarette smoke for 30 min daily for 5 days.

METHODS (Continued)

Lung Homogenization and Assay of AHH. At the end of the exposure period, the animals were killed by
overdose of diethyl ether, and the lungs were removed and homogenized in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.
The homogenates were centrifuged at 1050 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were assayed for AHH activity.
AHH activity was measured by the rate of formation of 7-hydroxycarbazole from β-naphthoflavone (4). The
reaction mixture contained 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25 μl of lung homogenate, and 2 mg of β-naphthoflavone.
The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH, and the formation of 7-hydroxycarbazole was measured at 345 nm.

Statistical Analysis. The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test.

RESULTS

Effect of Tobacco Smoke Exposure on Pulmonary AHH Activity

Guinea pigs exposed to tobacco smoke showed a marked increase in pulmonary AHH activity (Figure 1).
The activity of AHH was measured 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hr after exposure to tobacco smoke. The greatest
increase in AHH activity occurred at 6 hr after exposure. Guinea pigs exposed to tobacco smoke for 5 days
showed an increase in AHH activity of 300% compared to control animals (p < 0.01).

Effect of Anisohlin 734 on Pulmonary AHH Activity

Administration of Anisohlin 734 (500 mg/kg) inhibited the formation of AHH in guinea pigs exposed
to tobacco smoke (Figure 2). The administration of Anisohlin 734 also did not induce pulmonary AHH.

DISCUSSION

The results of this study show that exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke results in a marked increase
in pulmonary AHH activity. This effect is related to the amount of smoke inhaled per minute. Guinea pigs
are more sensitive than rats to the effects of tobacco smoke (5). The exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco
smoke results in regular increases in cortical adrene-nal content and decreases in body weight (2).

The increase in AHH activity is likely due to the induction of cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 is
a mixed-function oxidase that is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics (6). The induction of cytochrome
P450 can be inhibited by Anisohlin 734 (7).

The results of this study suggest that pulmonary AHH activity may be a useful indicator of exposure to
tobacco smoke. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between pulmonary AHH activity and
the chronic toxicological effects of tobacco smoke.

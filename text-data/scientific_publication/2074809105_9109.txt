THE ENTHALPIES OF FORMATION OF NESQUEHONITE,
MgCO₃ · 3H₂O, AND HYDROMAGNESITE, 5MgO·4CO₂ · 5H₂O

BY RICHARD A. ROBIE and BRUCE S. HEMINGWAY, Silver Spring, Md.

Abstract.—The enthalpies of formation, ΔH°f, of nesquehonite,
MgCO₃ · 3H₂O, and hydromagnesite, 5MgO·4CO₂ · 5H₂O, have been
determined by high-solution calorimetry. For the reaction

Mg(OH)₂+ CO₂(g) + 3H₂O(l) → MgCO₃ · 3H₂O(s),
the enthalpy change at 298.15 K is -29.78140 cal mol⁻¹. For the
reaction

5MgO(s) + 4CO₂(g) + 5H₂O(l) → 5MgO·4CO₂ · 5H₂O(s),
the enthalpy change at 298.15 K is -120.3160 cal mol⁻¹. MgCO₃
· 3H₂O uses the standard mullite stability and standard Gibbs free energy of
formation, ΔG°f, are -412.040(120) cal mol⁻¹ and ΔH°f for 5MgO·4CO₂ · 5H₂O
are -1,557.090(250) and -1,401.716(280) cal.

Recently Robie and Hemingway (1972b) presented heat
capacity measurements for nesquehonite between 12 and 310 K
and for hydromagnesite between 298 and 350 K, and 1/T
for the entropy changes ΔS° of the three minerals in this
report were calculated from these data. The enthalpy of
formation, ΔH°f, is a fundamental thermodynamic property
of a substance; it represents the heat absorbed or evolved
in the formation of one mole of the substance from its
elements in their standard states.

The reactions used to determine the enthalpy change for
nesquehonite 1 were

MgCO₃ · 3H₂O(s) → [285HCl + 3,641H₂] (aq) (1)

[MgCl₂ + 285HCl + 3,645H₂O](ad) + CO₂(g) (2)

Mg(OH)₂ (s) → [MgCl₂ + 285HCl + 3,642H₂O] (aq), and (4)
[MgCl₂ + 285HCl + 3,645H₂O](ad) (5)

Adding equations 4 and 5 subtracting reaction 3 yields

MgCO₃ · CO₂(g) + 3H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂·3H₂O(s) (3)

from which ΔH°(1) = ΔH°(4) - ΔH°(3). The enthalpy
change for reactions were used to obtain the
values shown in table 2.

MgCO₃ · 3H₂O (s), and 5MgO·4CO₂ · 5H₂O (s)

Compound                                    ΔH°f (cal mol⁻¹)   E(kJ/mol)
Nesquehonite, MgCO₃ · 3H₂O(s)              -29.78140            -25.36
Hydromagnesite, 5MgO·4CO₂ · 5H₂O(s)       -120.3160             -101.68

The standard Gibbs free energy of formation, ΔG°f, for
nesquehonite and hydromagnesite were calculated from the
enthalpy of formation and heat capacity data using the
equation

ΔG°f = ΔH°f - TΔS°f (6)

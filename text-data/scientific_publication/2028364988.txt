ANTI-SMOKING PUBLICITY, TAXATION, AND THE
DEMAND FOR CIGARETTES

Received September 1981, final version received January 1984

This study demonstrates that anti-smoking publicity in the Swiss media has had a
substantial effect on cigarette consumption. As noted in the U.S. Surgeon
General’s Report, accompanying various tax increases and preceding a public
relations campaign, the demand for cigarettes is affected by both advertising and publicity.
In addition, publicity had important indirect effects which are reflected in smoked-unit
reductions to normal cigarette prices. The effect of taxation is considered strong
and consistent; the price response failed to be significant thus, publicity in the mass media
provides a powerful tool for decreasing cigarette consumption.

1. Introduction

Cigarette smoking is the leading single preventable cause of death in
industrialized Western societies (USDHHS, 1980, p. xi). Between 4,000 and
5,000 premature deaths in Switzerland are attributed to smoking each year
[Leu and Schaub 1983a, b] and annual economic costs of smoking amount
to 600-800 million Swiss francs or roughly 0.7% of GNP [Leu 1982a].
Reduction of the level of smokes has become a major public health issue in
recent years.

The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two policy
instruments which may be employed by governments to reduce per capita
cigarette consumption: taxation and anti-smoking publicity. Time series
data on Swiss cigarette sales from 1954 to 1980 are analyzed.

Several hypotheses are tested about how taxation and publicity have
influenced cigarette demand. In particular, the study focuses on long-term
effects of publicity, the interaction between publicity and taxation, and
on the relative importance of the two policy instruments as deterrents of
cigarette consumption. The results imply that anti-smoking publicity did
have a substantial permanent impact and that there were important indirect
effects between publicity and taxation.

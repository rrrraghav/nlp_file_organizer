Misclassification of smoking status among women in relation to exposure to ‘environmental’ tobacco smoke. E. Riboli, N.J. Haley, J. Trédaniel, R. Saracci, S. Preston-Martin,

ABSTRACT: In studies of the health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), misclassification of smoking status can lead to biased estimates of disease risk. Biochemical validation of exposure to ETS can provide more accurate information on smoking habits and reduce this bias. We describe a method for the establishment of appropriate cut-off points for the measurements of urinary nicotine and its metabolites.

Within a collaborative study on KS-creatinine and urinary biomonitoring, 1369 women at 11 centres in 10 countries. Seventy seven of these women had urine creatinine concentrations below 50 pmol/ml, which was considered to be too low for reliable measurement. The prevalence of current smokers among women with high urinary nicotine-creatinine ratios was consistent with the association, and few women with moderate exposure to ETS were misclassified as non-smokers.

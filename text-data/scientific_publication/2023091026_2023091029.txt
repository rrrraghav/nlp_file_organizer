Abstract. Advertisements suggest that smokers of cig-
arettes low in yield are exposed to less nicotine and tar.
Nicotine yields are measured by smoking machine tests.
We have tested this assumption by measuring the con-
centration with urine nicotine in 135 smokers of as-
hitherto unmeasured, different nicotine content cigarettes
and 118 nonsmokers. The actual nicotine concentration
of these cigarettes did not account for body weight or
cigarette consumption.

We found that smokers of low-yield cigarettes con-
sume more nicotine per cigarette than do smokers of
high-yield cigarettes.

The concentration of nicotine in urine is cor-
related with the amount of nicotine consumed (r = +0.56, P < 0.001). In
fact, the nicotine concentration in urine is inversely correlated with
the yield of cigarettes smoked (r = -0.53, P < 0.001). This means that
smokers who smoke low-yield cigarettes consume more nicotime than do
smokers who smoke high-yield cigarettes.

We have also found that the concentration of nicotine in
urine is correlated with the amount of tar consumed (r = +0.52, P < 0.01).
This means that smokers who smoke low-yield cigarettes consume more tar
than do smokers who smoke high-yield cigarettes.

The results of this study suggest that smokers of low-
yield cigarettes are not consuming less nicotine or tar. In fact, the nicotime
concentration in urine is inversely correlated (r = -0.53, P < 0.001) with
the concentration measured by smoking machine tests. If we con-
sider only smokers who smoke low-yield cigarettes, the
nicotine concentration in urine is inversely correlated (r = -0.48, P < 0.01)
with the tar concentration.

The results of this study are consistent with the idea
that smokers may be trying to reduce their nicotine con-
sumption by smoking low-yield cigarettes. However, it is
possible that these smokers are simply consuming more
cigarettes per day than do smokers who smoke high-
yield cigarettes.

We have also found that the concentration of nicotime
in urine is correlated with the amount of tar consumed (r = +0.52, P < 0.01).
This means that smokers who smoke low-yield cigarettes consume more tar
than do smokers who smoke high-yield cigarettes.

The results of this study suggest that smokers of low-
yield cigarettes are not consuming less nicotine or tar. In fact, the nicotime
concentration in urine is inversely correlated (r = -0.53, P < 0.001) with
the concentration measured by smoking machine tests. If we con-
sider only smokers who smoke low-yield cigarettes, the
nicotine concentration in urine is inversely correlated (r = -0.48, P < 0.01)
with the tar concentration.

Smokers may not be trying to reduce their nicotime
consumption by smoking low-yield cigarettes. They may
be trying to smoke more cigarettes per day to get the
same amount of nicotine.

We have also found that the concentration of nicotime
in urine is correlated with the amount of tar consumed (r = +0.52, P < 0.01).
This means that smokers who smoke low-yield cigarettes consume more tar
than do smokers who smoke high-yield cigarettes.

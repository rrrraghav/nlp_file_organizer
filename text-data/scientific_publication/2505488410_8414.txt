Background. Evidence exists that maternal cigarette
smoking is associated with preterm birth. Our purpose
was to investigate the relation between maternal smok-
ing cessation at different points during pregnancy and
the preterm delivery rate and low birthweight.

Methods. Data from the 1988 National Health Inter-
view Survey were analyzed. The study included women
who gave birth to children within 6 years of the 1988
interview date (N = 4876). Preterm delivery and in-
fant low birthweight were the main outcome measures.
These measures were compared with maternal smoking
status during pregnancy. Logistic regression models
were computed to control for maternal age at the time
of birth, parity, race, and total family income.

Results. Women who did not smoke cigarettes during
pregnancy were less likely to give birth prematurely

(5.9% vs 8.2%, P = .003) or give birth to a low-birth-
weight baby (5.5% vs 8.9%, P < .001) than women
who smoked at some time during the year before giv-
ing birth. A significant association existed between ma-
ternal smoking status and both preterm delivery and
low birthweight. Compared with those who smoked
beyond the first trimester, those who quit smoking
within the first trimester had reductions in the propor-
tion of preterm deliveries (6.7% vs 9.1%) and low
birthweight infants (5.9% vs 8.6%).

Conclusions. Low birthweight and preterm delivery are
reduced at women who stop smoking in the first tri-
mester of pregnancy.

The disproportionate morbidity and mortality resulting
from preterm delivery need reduction of preterm delivery
as an important goal. *1* Maternal smoking following
low birthweights has declined, but this can be attributed
primarily to advances in prenatal care and changes in the
composition of the population. It is apparent that
maternal advice regarding the risk of pregnancy com-
plications for preterm delivery with continuing smoking
is not always heeded. *2*

Strategies for preterm prevention require a multifac-
eted approach. *3,4* The relationship between maternal
smoking and preterm delivery has been well documented.
The effect of smoking cessation on preterm delivery is
less clear. Some studies have suggested that women who
stop smoking before or during pregnancy may reduce their
risk of preterm delivery. *5,6* However, other studies have
not found a significant association. *7,8*

We hypothesized that the timing of smoking cessa-
tion during pregnancy would influence the risk of pre-
term delivery and low birthweight. We tested this hy-
pothesis using data from the 1988 National Health In-
terview Survey.

Methods

Data Source

The 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a
large, ongoing survey of a nationally representative sam-
ple of US households. The NHIS collects information
on a wide range of health topics, including pregnancy
outcomes. We extracted data from the Pregnancy and
Postpartum Sample, which includes detailed questions
about maternal smoking habits during pregnancy.

Study Population

The study population consisted of women who gave birth
to children within 6 years of the 1988 interview date.
We excluded women who did not respond to questions
about their smoking history during pregnancy (N = 734)
and those with missing data on preterm delivery or in-
fant low birthweight (N = 20). The final study sample
included 4876 women.

Variables

The primary outcome measures were preterm delivery
(delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) and infant low
birthweight (less than 2500 g). Maternal smoking sta-
tus was categorized as never smoker, stopped smoking be-
fore pregnancy, stopped smoking in the first trimester,
stopped smoking in the second or third trimester, or
smoked throughout pregnancy. We defined low birth-
weight as weighing less than 2500 g.

Statistical Analysis

We used logistic regression models to examine the asso-
ciation between maternal smoking status and preterm de-
livery and low birthweight, adjusting for maternal age at
the time of birth, parity, race, and total family income.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft-
ware (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).

Results

The demographic characteristics of the study population
are shown in Table 1. The mean maternal age was 27.8
years (SD = 5.6), and 34% were nulliparous. Black
women comprised 23% of the sample. The prevalence
of preterm delivery was 7.7%, and the prevalence of low
birthweight was 7.1%.

The risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight ac-
cording to maternal smoking status is shown in Table 2.
Women who did not smoke cigarettes during pregnancy
were less likely to give birth prematurely (5.9% vs 8.2%,
P = .003) or give birth to a low-birthweight baby (5.5%
vs 8.9%, P < .001) than women who smoked at some
time during the year before giving birth.

The risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight ac-
cording to timing of smoking cessation is shown in Ta-
ble 3. Women who stopped smoking in the first trimester
had a lower risk of preterm delivery (6.7% vs 9.1%, P =
.02) and low birthweight infants (5.9% vs 8.6%, P < .01)
compared with women who smoked beyond the first tri-
mester.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that smoking cessation during preg-
nancy is associated with a reduced risk of preterm de-
livery and low birthweight. The greatest reduction in risk
was observed among women who stopped smoking in the
first trimester.

These results are consistent with previous studies that
have shown an association between maternal smoking cessa-
tion and improved pregnancy outcomes. *5,6* However, other
studies have not found a significant association. *7,8* The
differences in findings may be due to differences in study
design, sample characteristics, or definitions of smok-
ing cessation.

Our study has several strengths. First, we used data
from a large, nationally representative survey. Second,
we controlled for important confounding variables such as
maternal age, parity, race, and total family income.
Third, we examined the effect of smoking cessation at dif-
ferent points during pregnancy.

Our study also has some limitations. First, the NHIS
is a cross-sectional survey, so we cannot establish cau-
sality. Second, we relied on self-reported data on smok-
ing habits, which may be subject to recall bias. Third,
we did not have information on other factors that could
influence pregnancy outcomes, such as maternal nutri-
tion or access to prenatal care.

Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that
smoking cessation during pregnancy is an important inter-
vention for reducing the risk of preterm delivery and low
birthweight. Women who stop smoking in the first tri-
mester appear to have the greatest benefit.

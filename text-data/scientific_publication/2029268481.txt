ABSTRACT

A high performance liquid chromatography method is described which quantifies hydroquinone, catechol, phenol and m³n-cresols in indoor air samples. Results from collection devices, extraction solvents and collection media show the pitfall that can be encountered when sampling indoor air. Air samples are collected by a modified impinger which traps the more volatile monohydroxy phenols followed by an impinger which traps the less volatile monohydroxy phenols. Sample extracts are analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Some compounds are detected at the submicrogram per cubic meter concentration.

INTRODUCTION

Hydroquinone has been determined in air by NIOSH method 5004 (1). The procedure calls for collection on a 0.8-m cellulose ester membrane, extraction with aqueous acetic acid and analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at 250 nm. Phenol in air has been determined by NIOSH method 3502 (2) which consists of collection in an H-type gas impingers followed by gas chromatographic separation and analysis by flame photometry (GC) with FID detection. OSHA procedure 32 (3) has been used for determining phenol at work places, desorption with methanol, separation by HPLC with UV detection at 210 nm. NIOSH method 40 (4) has been used to determine m³n-cresol and o-cresol in air by GC with FID detection. These compounds are collected on silica gel sampling tubes. Then desorption with acetone is done to obtain the analytes. Catechol, hydroquinone, phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol and 2,6-dichloroanisole were generated by K-reductants (1) (4) incorporated pentane hydrogen gas in HPLC-MS experiments of soot particulate matter. The determination of air samples include p-benzoquinone.

The NIOSH and OSHA procedures have relatively high detection limits. Quantitation of hydroquinone, catechol, phenol and m³n-cresols at submicrogram per cubic meter concentrations is difficult with these methods. A method was developed to determine the concentrations of these compounds in indoor air samples. The method combines a modified impinger collection system with reversed-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents and Standards
Hydroquinone, catechol, phenol, m³n-cresol, o-cresol, p-cresol, 2,6-dichloroanisole, acetic acid, acetone, methanol, hexane, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, ammonium chloride, potassium hydrogen phthalate, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and fluorescence standards were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI). All reagents were of HPLC grade.

Air Sample Collection
Indoor air samples were collected using a modified impinger system. The system consisted of two 4-L glass impingers connected in series. Air was drawn through the first impinger at a flow rate of 2 L/min for 10 min. The effluent from the first impinger flowed into the second impinger, where air was drawn at a flow rate of 2 L/min for an additional 10 min.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Hydroquinone, catechol, phenol and m³n-cresols were detected in all indoor air samples analyzed. The concentrations of these compounds varied depending on the location within the building. Hydroquinone was generally found to be the most abundant compound, followed by phenol and then m³n-cresols. Catechol was usually present at lower concentrations.

The detection limits for hydroquinone, catechol, phenol and m³n-cresols were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 µg/m³, respectively. These detection limits are significantly lower than those of the NIOSH and OSHA procedures.

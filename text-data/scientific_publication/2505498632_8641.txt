Cotinine Analytical Workshop Report:
Consideration of Analytical Methods for
Determining Cotinine in Human Body Fluids
as a Measure of Passive Exposure to
Tobacco Smoke*

by Randall R. Watts,† John J. Langone,‡ George J. Knight,§
and Joellen Rewtas¶

A two-day technical workshop was convened November 10–11, 1986, to discuss analytical approaches for determining the measurements of cotinine in human body fluids, resulting from one’s exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The workshop, sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control, was attended by scientists with expertise in cotinine analysis, toxicology, epidemiology, and risk assessment related
to ETS. The workshop format included technical presentations, separate panel discussions
on analytical methods, biological monitoring, and exposure assessment, and a final summary
consensus opinion on quality control aspects of passive smoking programs. This report presents
a consensus of the opinions expressed by the workshop participants and details the major
conclusions of the analytical approaches used by the various investigators discussed
separately.

Introduction

Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has increases- reported an association between tobacco smoke expo-
ingly become a health concern since a series of epide- sure and increased risk of human lung cancer. Hum-
miological studies between 1951 and 1969 (1–4). an and coworkers (8) recently confirmed the health
risk conclusions of earlier researchers and reported

that people who had never smoked were more likely to
smokers had about a 2-fold increased risk of lung
cancer.

Methods for determining the degree of exposure of
individuals has received much attention in recent
years, and various biological markers have been stud-
ied to analyze individuals for their determination
of ETS exposure. Cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine,
is an appropriate biomarker because it is relatively
stable in body fluids, can be measured with high
sensitivity, and is not produced endogenously (9).

The workshop participants agreed that cotinine
measurements in human body fluids could provide
useful information about the extent of passive smok-
ing exposure. However, they also recognized that
the accuracy and reliability of such measurements
depend on several factors, including: 1) the quality
of the analytical methods used; 2) the biological
factors that influence cotinine concentrations in
body fluids; and 3) the interpretation of results
in relation to exposure.

The purpose of this workshop was to address these
issues and to develop recommendations for improv-
ing the use of cotinine measurements as a tool for
assessing passive smoking exposure. The following
topics were discussed:

1. Analytical methods for measuring cotinine in
human body fluids.
2. Biological factors that influence cotinine con-
centrations.
3. Interpretation of results and relationship to
exposure.
4. Quality control procedures for ensuring the
accuracy and reliability of measurements.

Analytical Methods

Several analytical methods have been developed for
measuring cotinine in human body fluids, including
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
electrochemical detection, gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS), and radioimmunoassay
(RIA). Each method has its advantages and disad-
vantages.

HPLC–EC is a relatively simple and inexpensive
method that can be used to measure cotinine in a
variety of body fluids. However, it has lower sensitiv-
ity than GC–MS or RIA, and it may be subject to
interference from other compounds in the sample.

GC–MS is a more sensitive method that can be
used to identify and quantify cotinine with high
accuracy. However, it requires specialized equipment
and expertise, and it may be time-consuming.

RIA is a highly sensitive method that can be used
to measure cotinine in small volumes of body fluids.
However, it may be subject to interference from non-
cotinine compounds that cross-react with the anti-
body, and it may require frequent standardization.

Workshop participants agreed that HPLC–EC was
the most widely used method for measuring cotinine
in human body fluids, but they also recognized that
GC–MS and RIA could provide more accurate results
under certain circumstances. They recommended that
laboratories select the analytical method best suited
to their needs and resources, and that they validate
their methods to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Biological Factors

Cotinine concentrations in human body fluids are
influenced by a number of biological factors, including
age, sex, smoking habits, diet, and metabolism.

Age: Cotinine concentrations tend to be higher in
children than in adults (10). This may be due to the
fact that children have smaller lung volumes and
may inhale more ETS per breath than adults.

Sex: Women tend to have higher cotinine concen-
trations than men (11). This may be due to differ-
ences in metabolic rates or body composition.

Smoking habits: Cotinine concentrations are
directly related to the amount of tobacco smoke a
person is exposed to (12). Smokers generally have
much higher cotinine concentrations than nonsmokers.

Diet: Certain foods, such as broccoli and cabbage,
contain compounds that can interfere with cotinine
measurements (13). Therefore, it is important to
consider dietary factors when interpreting results.

Metabolism: Cotinine is metabolized by the liver
and excreted in the urine (14). Individuals who are
fast metabolizers may have lower cotinine concen-
trations than slow metabolizers.

Workshop participants agreed that these biological
factors should be considered when interpreting
cotinine measurements. They recommended that
laboratories collect information about potential con-
founding factors and adjust their results accordingly.

Interpretation of Results

Cotinine measurements can provide valuable infor-
mation about passive smoking exposure, but they
must be interpreted with caution. Cotinine concen-
trations are influenced by a number of factors, as
discussed above, and it is difficult to determine the
exact amount of tobacco smoke a person has been
exposed to based on cotinine measurements alone.

Workshop participants agreed that cotinine measure-
ments should be used in conjunction with other
information about exposure, such as questionnaires
and environmental monitoring data. They also rec-
ommended that laboratories provide clear and concise
reports that explain the limitations of cotinine mea-
surements and the factors that can influence results.

Quality Control Procedures

Quality control procedures are essential for ensuring
the accuracy and reliability of cotinine measurements.
These procedures should include:

1. Use of validated analytical methods.
2. Participation in proficiency testing programs.
3. Regular calibration of equipment.
4. Use of quality control samples.
5. Documentation of all procedures.

Workshop participants agreed that laboratories
should implement these quality control procedures to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of their cotinine
measurements. They also recommended that regula-
tory agencies establish standards for laboratory qual-
ity and accreditation.

Conclusions

Cotinine measurements can provide valuable infor-
mation about passive smoking exposure, but they
must be interpreted with caution. Laboratories
should use validated analytical methods, consider
biological factors that influence cotinine concen-
trations, and implement quality control procedures
to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their mea-
surements. Regulatory agencies should establish
standards for laboratory quality and accreditation.

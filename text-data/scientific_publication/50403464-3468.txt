We have previously reported the isolation of two
cDNAs, designated 24-and 26-24, which have
identical open reading frames and code for a novel brain
cytochrome P-450 (P-450) belonging to the CYP2D subfamily.
This cDNA clone was isolated from rat brain,
though the expressed amino acid sequences of these clones
differed from those of known human CYP2Ds by only 3 amino
acids distributed in the C-terminal region, this new
P-450 cDNA contained a unique 5'-extension, and
we posit in this report by analysis of genomic clone
that this 5'-untranslated sequence is derived from a
pseudogene. The genomic DNA, this novel gene
named CYP2D P450 2D18 according to recom-
mended nomenclature (2), the accessibility of this
cDNA was confirmed by translocation using
t-poly(A)s extending, and expressed expression was per-
formed using COS-7 cells. The mRNA abundance is
shown with cross-reacting antibodies, which size
range a spot-like 508 amino acid predicted size shown
with anti-P450 fraction. Furthermore, we analyzed
the substrate specificity of the recombinant CYP2D18
protein by in vitro assays using several drugs and xenobiotics
known to be metabolized by human CYP2Ds. The results
demonstrate that rat CYP2D18 exhibits a high catalytic
activity toward imipramine, comparable to that observed
for human CYP2D6. In addition, CYP2D18 also metabolizes
desipramine, amitriptyline, and doxepin, although with
lower efficiency. These findings suggest that CYP2D18
may play an important role in the metabolism of tricyclic
antidepressants in rat brain, similar to the function of
human CYP2D6 in humans. The involvement of CYP2Ds
in the central nervous system have been suggested (5, 6). For in-
stance, it has been shown that the polymorphism in the poly-
morphisic CYP2D6 gene is associated with susceptability to Parkinson’s disease (5) and that
4-hydroxylation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, a possible
biomarker for Parkinson’s disease, is catalyzed by human
CYP2D6 in rat liver (7). It was also demonstrated that
the human isoform CYP2D6 participates in the metabolism of
some tricyclic antidepressants (8)

However, the vast majority of these studies were performed
using liver microsomes or hepatocytes. Thus,
whether substantially 2D P-450 catalyzes these metabolisms
in brain is not clear. In our laboratory, we have been interested in
the role of P-450s in brain function and our studies have
revealed a structure for the existence and functionality of 2D-
P-450s in brain. Thus, we seek to investigate whether imi-
pramine N-demethylation occurs in rat brain tissue in situ or
liver and shown difference in the effects of the inducer, ver-
milion on brain imipramine metabolism (10). Therefore, we
have focused our attention on identifying P-450s that are ex-
pressed in rat brain. In this paper, we report the cloning
and characterization of a novel rat brain CYP2D cDNA, desig-
nated CYP2D18, which exhibits high catalytic activity to-
ward imipramine N-demethylation. We also describe the gen-
omic organization of this gene and its expression in COS-7
cells. The results suggest that CYP2D18 may play an impor-
tant role in the metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants in rat
brain, similar to the function of human CYP2D6 in humans.

Polluted Data

By Samuel S. Epstein

The author surveys the record of industry-generated data

Evaluating evidence shows that consultants on data
from government, industry, and even from some non-
governmental organizations are often bought. When
such evidence is not just ignored but reconfigured as
the basis for policy decisions, it becomes impossible
to deal with economic interests that are directly or
indirectly affected.

Information is the currency of power. And
points of power become involved at all levels of gov-
ernment, and they have a vested interest in making
decisions on the basis of the relative merits
of alternate policies can be analyzed and considered
without whatever decisions are reached being also be
subject to influence, threatening the labor of demo-
cratic government.

The overwhelming bulk of all benefits and risk
comes from the industries themselves being regulated.
All those data have been generated and manipulated
in a manner that is built in for commercial interests
and maneuvers under contract to industry.

Industry’s scientists are subject to con-
straints and subordinations pressures from research
and development and marketing departments, as well
as from their financial products or profits into
more favorable relations are usually awarded so
that the industries themselves can be assured of
without having to have been seen in the open
market place, practice harsh constraints on the lives
of consumers.

The most recent sign for me to provide
more public information concerning the widespread
manipulation of data is the fact that the EPA has
now withdrawn its proposed regulation of trichloro-
methane, a solvent widely used in industry.

But this is just one example. There are
thousands of examples where industry’s scientists
and engineers have been able to manipulate data to
serve their own purposes.

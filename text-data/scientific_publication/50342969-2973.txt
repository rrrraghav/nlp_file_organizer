ABSTRACT The glucocorticoid response element (GRE)
of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) was chemically
synthesized as two complementary DNA strands bearing 32
base-terminal oligonucleotide sequences. Random mutations
were introduced into the DNA by “popping” each of the four
nucleoside phosphoramidites (A, G, C, and T) with a low level
of activation. The mutated strands were annealed and
cloned into a 315 phage vector to produce a library of GRE
mutants. Mutations within the synthesized region were iden-
tified by sequencing phage isolates at random. We have
chemically distinct classes of transition and transversion mu-
tations have been observed. Statistical considerations indicate
that the library contains all of the possible 90 point substitution
mutations within a 30-nucleotide mutagenic target span. So far, 86
of these substitutions have been identified. At least 20 of the
positions have three single mutants each and at least 30
positions have been identified.

In an effort to understand the molecular basis of GRE
function, we have constructed a library of point mutations
fixed in a chemically synthesized DNA fragment encoding
the GRE. This approach differs from those used previously (1,
2) in that it allows for the introduction of random muta-
tions at defined positions within a specific DNA sequence.
The GRE is an important regulatory element in the MMTV
genome and mediates increased viral RNA synthesis in re-
sponse to glucocorticoid hormones (3, 4). The ability of
glucocorticoids to stimulate gene expression is mediated
by binding of a receptor protein to this DNA sequence.
The mechanism by which the hormone regulates transcrip-
tion is not fully understood, but it undoubtedly an integral part of the regulatory
mechanism. Assays of various deletion mutants (12, 13,
16–19), combined with rescue-DNA footprinting
experiments (14, 15), indicate that a domain of ≈30 nucleo-
tides (positions –16 to +14 relative to the start of tran-
scription; see Fig. 1) contains a strong receptor binding site
and is critical for activity. We therefore expected that
this combination of in vivo and in vitro yield insights into the
in this domain that have revealed structural insights into the
sequence specificity of the regulatory element and the
mechanism of steroid-mediated regulation of gene expres-
sion.

The method relies on automated synthesis of the target
sequence in a way that yields a randomly mutagenized
preparation. This is achieved by a slight modification of the
usual synthetic procedure, in which chains are built stepwise
from the 3' end by the addition of nucleoside phosphoramid-
ite monomers. In the standard procedure, each of the
four monomer reservoirs is “doped” with a small amount
of water to facilitate cleavage of the phosphate triester bond
and release of the growing chain from the solid support.
In our modified synthesis procedure, we briefly expose the
growing chain to a low level of activator before adding
each monomer (20). This results in occasional “popping”
(loss) of bases from all four reservoirs, introducing random
mutations into the DNA sequence.

The mutagenized strands are then annealed and cloned
into a 315 phage vector (21) to produce a library of GRE
mutants. The resulting plaques are scored for their ability
to support transcription of the MMTV long terminal repeat
(LTR) in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, a syn-
thetic glucocorticoid. Plaque size is taken as an indicator
of GRE function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Oligonucleotide Synthesis and DNA Synthesis—The
GRE sequence was chemically synthesized as two comple-
mentary oligonucleotides (22) using a solid-phase phos-
phoramidite approach (23). The oligonucleotides were
extended at the 5' end with a T7 promoter sequence and
at the 3' end with a linker region for cloning into the 315
phage vector. The two strands were annealed and cloned
into the 315 phage vector as described (21). Random
mutations were introduced into the DNA by “popping” each
of the four nucleoside phosphoramidites (A, G, C, and T)
with a low level of activator.

Sequence Analysis—Phage plaques were picked at ran-
dom and isolated for sequence analysis. Plasmids were
prepared from phage DNA using standard procedures (24).
The sequences of the mutagenized regions were determined
by the dideoxy chain termination method (25) using both
the vector strands as templates.

RESULTS

Library Construction—A library of GRE mutants was
constructed by chemically synthesizing a 32-base-pair
GRE sequence, introducing random mutations into the se-
quence, and cloning the mutagenized strands into a 315
phage vector. The resulting library contains ≈10^7 plaques
and is expected to contain all possible point substitution
mutations within a 30-nucleotide target span.

Identification of Mutations—Mutations within the syn-
thesized region were identified by sequencing phage iso-
lates at random. A total of 86 mutations have been iden-
tified in 54 plaques. The mutations are distributed nonran-
domly throughout the sequence, with some positions having
multiple mutants.

DISCUSSION

The library of GRE mutants provides a unique tool for
studying the molecular basis of glucocorticoid receptor
action that is undoubtedly an integral part of the regulatory
mechanism. Assays of various deletion mutants (12, 13,
16–19), combined with rescue-DNA footprinting
experiments (14, 15), indicate that a domain of ≈30 nucleo-
tides (positions –16 to +14 relative to the start of tran-
scription; see Fig. 1) contains a strong receptor binding site
and is critical for activity. We therefore expected that
this combination of in vivo and in vitro yield insights into the
in this domain that have revealed structural insights into the
sequence specificity of the regulatory element and the

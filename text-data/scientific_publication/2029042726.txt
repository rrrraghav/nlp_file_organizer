Markers of Exposure to Carcinogens

by Gerald N. Wogan*

Methods have been developed for the detection of carcinogens and other DNA damaging agents
in body fluids through adducts bound covalently to DNA or hemoglobin. The successful use of phytohemag-
glutinin as an indicator of exposure to Aflatoxin, and AFB1-N-guanine as an indicator of exposure to N-
nitroso compounds, has much been used to detect AFB1 and AFB2.  N-guanine as markers of ex-
posure to aflatoxins. The use of phytohemagglutinin as a marker for DNA damage and the use of
mine glycerol as an indicator of exposure to acute respiratory oxidative damage to hemoglobin have been reported
in studies of occupationally exposed individuals who were also exposed to ethylene oxide, in which 2-hydroxyethyl-
and 2-aminobiphenyl and 2-hydroxyvaline that are excreted in urine.  The frequency of cigarette smoking
is correlated with the presence of adducts in the cells and an exposed individual has also been
measured by immunoassays and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results have been accomplished through the use of several types of analytical methods. Immunoassays and fluorescence spectro-
scopy have been used to detect adducts formed during the major intermediate in the activation of
benzalpyrene, the 7,12-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPXDE). This adduct has been found in the urine and leo
of workers in aluminum smelters, roasters, and coke oven plants, and also
in urine of smokers. BPXDE adducts have been detected by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy as well
as immunoassays conducted in blood samples from non-smokers.  The detection of BPXDE adducts
is correlated to the exposure of workers who are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
*Oxyhemoglobin gunned in the presence of high concentrations of oxygen and a small amount of glucose is also used
to detect BPXDE adducts. The detection of BPXDE adducts has been found in urine samples from
the method of 14C-portaline for the cell reflection of portaline as well as one and foundry workers.

The technical limitations involved with this method, however, are several.

The most difficult problem is that of specificity.  As it is known, we could only measure the
amount of adducts formed in the cells of a person’s body. The next problem is that of sensitivity.
The third problem is that of reproducibility.  The final problem is that of cost.  In order to overcome these
problems, we have developed several new methods for the detection of carcinogens and other DNA damaging agents
in body fluids. These methods are based on the use of antibodies and immunoassays. The antibodies are
produced by injecting a protein antigen into an animal. The protein antigen is then purified and conjugated
to a carrier molecule. The conjugate is then injected into another animal, which produces antibodies against
the protein antigen. The antibodies are then purified and used to detect the presence of the protein antigen
in body fluids.

The immunoassays are based on the use of labeled antibodies. The labeled antibodies are produced by
conjugating an antibody to a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent dye. The labeled antibodies are then
incubated with a sample of body fluid. If the protein antigen is present in the sample, it will bind to the
labeled antibodies. The amount of labeled antibodies that bind to the sample can be measured and used to
determine the concentration of the protein antigen in the sample.

The fluorescence spectroscopy methods are based on the use of fluorescent dyes. The fluorescent dyes
are excited by light and emit light at a different wavelength. The intensity of the emitted light is proportional
to the concentration of the fluorescent dye in the sample. The fluorescent dyes can be used to detect the
presence of carcinogens and other DNA damaging agents in body fluids.

The methods described above have been used to detect a variety of carcinogens and other DNA damaging
agents in body fluids. These include Aflatoxin B1, 4-aminobiphenyl, ethylene oxide, and vinyl chloride. The
methods have also been used to monitor the exposure of workers to these chemicals.

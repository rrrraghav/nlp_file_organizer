Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke concentrations from 2.4 mg/m³ of suspended
particulate matter (SPM) and 8 ppm CO to 190 mg/m³ SPM and 15 ppm CO for 4
hours at room temperature. Plasma corticosterone levels increased significantly after
exercise in smoke containing 15 mg/m³ SPM and 15 ppm of CO and its severity increased
with higher concentrations of smoke. Plasma glucose levels also increased significantly after
exercise in smoke containing 34 mg/m³ SPM and 31 ppm of CO. An increase in plasma
creatine kinase B (CK-B) isoenzyme was found only at the highest smoke level (190 mg/m³ SPM and
20 ppm CO). Plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes, particularly LDH
isozyme Band 2 were found only at the highest smoke level (190 mg/m³ SPM and 20 ppm
CO). No significant changes in plasma enzymes were observed. The two higher
smoke exposures were sufficient to cause light exercise and were attributed to SPM at levels exceeding 34
mg/m³. The amount of acceptable cigarette smoke needed to induce significant systemic changes in rats greatly
exceeded current national air quality standards and threshold limits for SPM and CO
established for man.

INTRODUCTION

Recently the possible deleterious effects of atmospheric pollutants on man have
received wide publicity. A number of reports on the effects of cigarette smoke
on various physiological parameters, including blood pressure and heart rate, have
shown an increased incidence of respiratory suppression such as headaches and
irritation of the eyes and sinuses (Passchier, 1965; Uphoff and Ronge, 1965; Eld-
ridge, 1970; Kilburn et al., 1974; Schlundt, 1974; Ware et al., 1973). However, rela-
tively little is known of systematic effects in various species. It has been shown that cigarette smoke can alter the body temperature and heart rate of rabbits (Anderson
et al., 1968) and is used in the diagnosis of the severity of stress (Selye, 1950;
Hicks et al., 1954). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a
number of concentrations of cigarette smoke on plasma enzymes, corticosterone, and
body temperature in mice. A graded exposure approach was used to determine the
minimum concentration of cigarette smoke needed to induce significant systemic
changes in rats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals—Male Swiss-Webster mice (20–25 g) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, Maine). The animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room at 23 ± 1°C
with a 12-hr light/dark cycle and given ad libitum access to Wayne Labs rodent chow and water.

Experimental Design—The mice were divided into five groups of six animals each.
Group I was exposed to no cigarette smoke (control). Groups II, III, IV, and V were exposed
to cigarette smoke concentrations of 2.4 mg/m³ SPM and 8 ppm CO, 15 mg/m³ SPM and 15
ppm CO, 34 mg/m³ SPM and 31 ppm CO, and 190 mg/m³ SPM and 20 ppm CO, respectively.

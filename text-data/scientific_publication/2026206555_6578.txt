ABSTRACT

Experimental cigarettes that approach the lower practical limits in tobacco
density and circumference of that which can be produced were used for this
study. They were ignited against a series of fabrics consisting of 33 cellulosic
fabric are polyuréthane and untreated cotton batting substrates. The panel-fiber
configurations were: (1) vertical, (2) horizontal, and (3) at a 20° angle.
The horizontal test outputs ranged from about 700 to 2500 cal/g, while the
vertical test outputs ranged from about 400 to 1600 cal/g. The average heat
evolved/hr for 33 fabrics over polyuréthane all cigarettes in ignition patterns
was 1980 ± 370 cal/g. It was found that the amount of metal content
which improved ignitability over polyuréthane were yarn influenced
properties, such as yarn twist and fabric density and weight. Cigarettes pro-
duce a narrow range of weighted fabric characteristics. The untreated cot-
ton batting fabrics gave higher heat outputs than the treated cotton bat-
ting fabrics. It was found that the horizontal test configuration produced
a slightly higher heat output gain had an effect only over a narrow range of weighted
fabric characteristics.

In the flat configuration all cigarettes produced identical ignition patterns
when tested on fabric/polyuréthane specimens. In the 20° configuration, as
well as in the vertical configuration, there were significant differences
lower rates of ignition. It appears therefore that generalized statements

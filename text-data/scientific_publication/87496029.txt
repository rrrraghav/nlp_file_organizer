Edited by Cook, Marcus, Dennis,
and others. Rice smoke was collected from rice husks during
combustion and analyzed for particulate matter. The method
includes the elution of PAH compounds from brown rice
particulate matter using dimethylformamide. The PAHs
measured were: benzo[a]pyrene [32-53 μg/kg], chrysene
[18-47 μg/kg], dibenz[a,h]pyrene [9-30 μg/kg], indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene
[6-18 μg/kg], benzo[g,h,i]perylene [5-19 μg/kg], fluoranthene
[14-37 μg/kg], pyrene [10-27 μg/kg], benz(a)anthracene [6-18 μg/kg],
benzo[b]fluoranthene [10-25 μg/kg], benzo[k]fluoranthene [4-13 μg/kg],
and acenaphthene [14-37 μg/kg]. The mutagenicity and
toxicity of rice smoke were evaluated using the Ames test.

98-356026 Aging or enhancing the aroma or taste
of smoking tobacco or a smoking tobacco article by adding
smoke extract. U.S. Patent 5,749,164. (pp. 27-32). Assigned to
British American Tobacco Co., Ltd. London, England.
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,164) A method for aging or enhancing the
aroma or taste of smoking tobacco or a smoking tobacco article
by adding smoke extract. The smoke extract is prepared by
exposing tobacco to smoke and collecting the smoke in an
inert gas atmosphere. The inert gas atmosphere may be
nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, or mixtures thereof.
The smoke extract may contain particulate matter, volatile
organic compounds, and other components of the smoke.
The smoke extract is added to the smoking tobacco or a
smoking tobacco article in an amount sufficient to impart
the desired aroma or taste. The method can be used to
impart a variety of aromas and tastes to the smoking
tobacco or a smoking tobacco article.

98-356027 Apparatus for dispensing particulate matter.
U.S. Patent 5,746,189. (pp. 27-32). Assigned to The Proctor
& Gamble Co., Cincinnati, Ohio. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,746,189)
An apparatus for dispensing particulate matter, such as
cosmetic powder or fragrance particles. The apparatus
includes a reservoir for storing the particulate matter and a
dispensing mechanism for delivering the particulate matter to
a user. The dispensing mechanism includes a rotating disc
having a plurality of recesses formed therein. The recesses
are filled with the particulate matter, and as the disc rotates,
the particulate matter is dispensed from the recesses. The
apparatus may also include a means for controlling the rate
of rotation of the disc, such that the amount of particulate
matter dispensed can be controlled.

98-356028 A process for producing a tobacco product
having reduced levels of undesirable components. U.S. Patent
5,746,190. (pp. 27-32). Assigned to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Winston-Salem, North Carolina. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,746,190)
A process for producing a tobacco product having reduced
levels of undesirable components, such as nitrosamines and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The process includes
treating the tobacco with an oxidizing agent, such as ozone
or hydrogen peroxide. The oxidizing agent reacts with the
undesirable components in the tobacco, converting them to
less harmful compounds. The treated tobacco is then used
to produce a tobacco product, such as cigarettes or chewing
tobacco.

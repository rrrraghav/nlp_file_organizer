Commitment to the cell cycle in fission yeast requires the function of the cdc18+ transcriptional activator at START. The product of the cdc18+ gene is a major downstream target of cln3+ and transcription of cdc18+ is activated by cln3+ during passage through START. The cdc18+ function is required for entry into S phase. In addition, the product of the cdc18+ gene acts as a cell cycle control that prevents mitosis from occurring until S phase is completed. Thus, cdc18+ plays a key role in coupling S phase to START and mitosis.

Introduction
Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is a convenient organism for studying the control of the cell cycle (Roberts, 1985; Nurse, 1986). A number of genes involved in controlling the sequence of events during the cell cycle have been identified in this organism. These genes include those required for START, S phase, and mitosis (e.g., wee1+, rum1+, kin1+, dos4+, cdc2+, cln3+; Hunt et al., 1987; Li et al., 1987; Russell et al., 1987; Simerth et al., 1988; Wright et al., 1988).

We have isolated and characterized a novel mutant, cdc18-25, which fails to enter mitosis after passing through S phase. The product of the cdc18+ gene is required for entry into S phase and for progression from S phase to mitosis (Kelly et al., 1989). Cdc18p is a component of a multiprotein complex that functions as an essential transcriptional activator (Aves et al., 1986) and has been shown to be homologous to the retinoblastoma protein pRb(55%) (Aves et al., 1986) that appears to be an essential component of a recently identified transcription factor complex that activates specific genes at the begin-ning of S phase (Lowndes et al., 1991, 1992b).

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, over 15 genes involved in DNA replication are periodically expressed in late G1 (reviewed in Johnston and Lowndes, 1992; Merrill et al., 1992, 1993). Many of these genes encode POL1, POL2, PH1, PRI2, etc.), while others require entry into S phase to be transcribed (e.g., CDC20, DBP, etc.). The promoter regions of S phase genes contain the sequence ACGCG or a closely related sequence, called the Multi cell cycle box (MCB) element (Gordon and Campbell, 1991; Lowndes et al., 1991; Melli-son et al. 1991; Verma et al., 1991). This MCB element is sufficient to confer cell cycle control on heterologous promoters (Lowndes et al., 1991). An MCB-binding activity called DSC1 or MCDB (Lowndes et al., 1991; Verma et al., 1991) that is present transiently in G1 has been identified. In crude yeast cell extracts, this consists with a role in the periodic activation of transcription. The SWI6 protein is an essential component of DSC1 (Lowndes et al., 1992a; DiNardo et al., 1992) and is involved in sequence-regulated DNA binding activity called SWI (Andrews and Heiszwitz, 1988; Tabas et al., 1991, 1993). SWI, which also contains the SWB protein, recognizes a consensus CACGAA or the similar element found in late G1 genes including a subset of S phase genes (Lowndes et al., 1991; Gordon and Campbell, 1991). The products of the FLO11, ZRP1, PIR2, NGR1, and MSN4 genes (e.g., Carlisle et al., 1991; Primig et al., 1991; Morrissey et al., 1991; Sarabia et al., 1992; Nathaniel and Dirik, 1993) are also components of DSC1.

We have found that the product of the cdc18+ gene is an essential component of DSC1. The cdc18+ gene encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity to retinoblastoma pRb (Kelly et al., 1989). Here, we describe the characterization of the cdc18-25 mutant and demonstrate that Cdc18p functions as a transcriptional activator required for entry into S phase and progression through mitosis.

Results

CDC18+ IS REQUIRED FOR ENTRY INTO S PHASE
AND PROGRESSION THROUGH MITOSIS

cdc18-25 mutants fail to enter mitosis after passing through S phase (Kelly et al., 1989). These mutants accumulate at a point in the cell cycle between S phase and mitosis. The cdc18-25 mutation is lethal, and thus it is not possible to analyze the phenotype of these mutants directly. However, by using a diploid strain, we were able to generate haploid segregants that carry the cdc18-25 allele (Kelly et al., 1989).

cdc18-25 mutants are blocked in S phase. This was determined by monitoring DNA synthesis with BrdU incorporation (Figure 1A). Wild-type cells incorporate BrdU throughout S phase, whereas cdc18-25 mutants incorporate BrdU only during the first half of S phase. The remaining cells are arrested at a point in the cell cycle between S phase and mitosis.

cdc18-25 mutants also fail to progress through mitosis. This was determined by monitoring nuclear division with DAPI staining (Figure 1B). Wild-type cells undergo multiple rounds of nuclear division, whereas cdc18-25 mutants are arrested at a point in the cell cycle between S phase and mitosis.

how much our understanding of culture has advanced. It is a commonplace

131. The Preservation and Use of Traditional Knowledge
By A. Wray in Annual Anthropological Articles

Independent
Moreover, as a consequence of global political and economic changes,
traditional knowledge is now under threat. It is being lost at an alarming
rate, particularly among indigenous populations. This loss is due to a
number of factors, including globalization, urbanization, and the influence
of Western culture. Traditional knowledge is also being exploited by
corporations and governments for commercial purposes without the consent
or benefit of the communities from which it originates.

Traditional knowledge is an integral part of many cultures around the
world. It has been passed down through generations and provides valuable
insights into the natural world, human health, and social relationships.
It also contributes to cultural identity and a sense of community.

Procedures for preservation of traditional knowledge are complex and require
careful consideration of ethical issues. It is important to ensure that
traditional knowledge is protected from exploitation and that indigenous
peoples have control over how their knowledge is used.

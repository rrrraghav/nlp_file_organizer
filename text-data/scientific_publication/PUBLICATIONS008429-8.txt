Quantitative studies of MCF-7 cells derived from human breast adenocarcinoma and CV-7 cells (derived from normal African green monkey kidney epithelium) us- activity in vivo (7). These results suggest [D. P. Cohen], a mitochondria is an important target for anticancer drugs. It is therefore of great interest to understand the mechanisms by which these compounds affect both uptake and retention of RH 123.

The accumulation and retention of rhodamine 123 (RH 123), drive brane, uptake and retention of TFP and RH 123 drives brane, uptake and retention of TFP and RH 123 drives brane, uptake and retention of TFP and RH 123. driven by membrane potentials, is a characteristic feature of many anticancer drugs (1, 2, 6). This phenomenon is greatly in MCF-7 than in CV-7 cells. An isosorbic acid derivative also causes this to be reversible. The accumulation of RH 123 is associated with both mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials. It increases accumulation in mitochondria more than it does in the cell as a whole. The retention of RH 123 is dependent on both mitochondrial and plasma membrane function. A high-potential state in the mitochondria causes an increase in RH 123 accumulation, while a low-potential state decreases accumulation. The retention of RH 123 is also dependent on the plasma membrane potential. An increased potential increases retention, whereas a decreased potential decreases retention.

The ability of anticancer drugs to accumulate and retain RH 123 may be an important factor in their cytotoxicity (3). It has been shown that many anticancer drugs cause a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (4, 5), which may contribute to their cytotoxic activity in vivo (7). These results suggest [D. P. Cohen], a mitochondria is an important target for anticancer drugs. It is therefore of great interest to understand the mechanisms by which these compounds affect both uptake and retention of RH 123.

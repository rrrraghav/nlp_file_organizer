AMMONIA AND TRACHEAL HISTOLOGY 103

Fig. 9. Rat trachea after 7 days exposure to 435 = 135 p.p.m. ammonia showing an acute inflammatory response with edema, infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, denudation of ciliated cells, and destruction of the layer surface layers. Ehrlich’s hematoxylin and eosin; Line represents 40 µm

Many thousands of animals are used every year to study aspects of inhalation toxicity. If the standard of husbandry of the experimental animals before and during use allows variability in parameters such as ammonia build-up, the results obtained can only be an inaccurate assessment of the true reaction to any procedure.
Scientists should be aware that environmental control in their animal houses is just as important as overt disease control for the validity of their experimental results.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The authors would like to thank Dr H. Georgis for help in the interpretation of the histological changes. Also Miss Joyce Breeden and Mr M. J. Witt for technical assistance.

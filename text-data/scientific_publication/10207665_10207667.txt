Tobacco leaf and smoke condensates contain a series
of high-molecular weight humic substances that may be
of importance in tobacco quality and other pragmatic
aspects. In most of these pigments contain
polyphenols, alkaloids and volatile acids, as well as
amino acids and resins. Details of the composition of these
pigments have not been reported (1).

Much information has been obtained from a series of sub-
strates on alkaline extracts of tobacco leaf. The main
alkaline-soluble components are polyphenols, in which the
fraction is referred to as “leaf pigment” and weakly
acidic, non-diffusible (NP) or the smoke
condensate pigments. These have been extensively investigated. Among the alkaline fusion products found
are aliphatic fatty acids containing a series of un-
saturated fatty acids two simple phenols and un-
substituted but less often. Since all these components
have been obtained from alkaline extracts, it is assumed
(1), the existence of fatty acids and simple phenols as
free compounds in leaf tissue. The findings in this
paper present the evidence that such moieties might
be released by a slow acidic reaction, such as saponification.

The yields of saponification products of LP and SP
are shown in Table 1, actually, after a 24-hour
saponification. The table shows the yields from the
second hydrolysis was similar to those from the first.
The main products of the saponification are fatty acids
and simple phenols. The relative amounts of these
components vary with the type of pigment. Leaf pig-
ments (LP) contain a higher proportion of saturated
fatty acids than do smoke pigments (SP). This is
consistent with the observation that LP is more
diffusible than SP.

The fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography
with a packed column of silicone polymer. The phenols
were identified by comparison with authentic samples.
The relative amounts of the various components are
shown in Table 2.

The results indicate that LP and SP contain a series
of fatty acids and simple phenols which may be released
by an acidic reaction, such as saponification.

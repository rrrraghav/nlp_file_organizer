Actual HLA typing has been performed on 115 members of cancer family N,
a large kindred (over 100 members) demonstrating several unusual
patterns in the inheritance of HLA antigens. The most prominent is a strong
C and D) of the family, 20 of 27 members with cancer have HLA haplo-
type HLAA30,B14,DRw53. This suggests that this family has inherited
members who have haplotype shared. Of 16 cancer patients with
cancer in branches C and D, actually typed, had HLAA30,HLAB14 (relative
frequency 0.50). The HLA antigens are also present in a single
branch B is a child of a family member with haploype HLAA30,HLAB14.
Cancer 36:1192-1198, 1980.

The significance of host factors in many
familial varieties of cancer is unresolv-
ed. Different genetic mechanisms may be involved
with different etiologies in different pedigrees.
In some instances, the presence only a history
of cancer and cancer/predisposition syndromes
such as familial adenomatosis polyposis,1
colloid polypoid,2 or Von Recklinghausen’s
neurofibromatosis3 are observed. Consequently, can-
cer risk for certain types of genetic importance in
families may be determined according to kin-
ship and family history. The ability to define
distinguishing preneoplastic signals and/or
tumor markers is often limited by the absence
of particular clinical manifestations.

One area where human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) typing has been useful is in the identi-
fication of cancer families.4,5 HLA antigens are
cell surface markers that are inherited in a co-
dominant fashion and are highly polymorphic.
The presence of unusual HLA distributions in
families with cancer suggests that certain HLA
antigens may be associated with an increased
risk of developing cancer.6,7

“It is well known that lack of associ-
tion in the population does not preclude link-
age to a cancer gene.

Lacking, however, have been detailed stud-
ies of HLA antigens in families whose
whose genealogies, tumor verifications, and
HLA antigen types were systematically in-
vestigated.8

We here present data showing association
of HLA kindred in Family N is a large
kindred which manifests the cancer family
Cancer 36:1192-1198, 1980.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Family N is one of the few kindreds
whose genealogies have been documented
in detail. The family resides in a rural area
of central Pennsylvania and has a history
of cancer spanning several generations.
The family was initially identified by
Dr. Charles G. Cohen, who noted an un-
usually high incidence of cancer among its
members.

Family members were screened for can-
cer history through interviews with key
family members. Individuals with a his-
tory of cancer or those who were first-de-
gree relatives of affected individuals were
typed for HLA antigens. Typing was per-
formed at the University of Washington
Immunology Laboratory using standard
techniques.9,10

RESULTS

The family N pedigree is shown in Figure 1.
A total of 115 members of the family have
been typed for HLA antigens. The most
striking feature of the family is the pres-
ence of an unusual HLA haplotype, HLAA30,
HLAB14, DRw53, which appears to segre-
gate with cancer in several branches of the
family.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of this
haplotype among affected and unaffected
individuals in the family. As can be seen,
the haplotype is present in approximately
50% of the affected individuals, compared
to only 10% of the unaffected individuals.
This difference is statistically significant (p <
0.001).

In addition to the HLAA30, HLAB14, DRw53
haplotype, other HLA antigens are also
abnormal in this family. For example,
HLAA2 is present in approximately 30% of
the affected individuals, compared to only
5% of the unaffected individuals (p < 0.01).

DISCUSSION

The findings presented here provide further
evidence for the role of HLA antigens in
cancer predisposition. The presence of an
unusual HLA haplotype, HLAA30, HLAB14,
DRw53, which segregates with cancer in
family N suggests that this haplotype may
confer an increased risk of developing can-
cer.

The mechanism by which this haplotype
may increase cancer risk is not clear. It is
possible that the haplotype itself is caus-
ing the cancer, or that it is simply a mark-
er for another genetic factor that is causing
the cancer. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the precise role of HLA antigens
in cancer predisposition.

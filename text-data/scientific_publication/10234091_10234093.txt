Summary
A discriminant function based on the
excretion ratios (3α-total 11-oxosteroids and 17-OH-
oxosteroids) was used to classify patients with lung cancer
and controls. The discriminant function significantly
correlated with the period of survival from the date of
diagnosis in patients with inoperable lung
cancer. Among those variable in their discriminant
function values, a ratio of 17-OH-oxa/total
oxosteroids was of as much prognostic
value as the discriminant.

Introduction

Previous work from this laboratory¹ has shown
that patients with cancer differ from controls
in several aspects of the excretion of urinary steroids.
These differences were combined into a discriminant
function:
[3α-KNA + (0.69 x KEA) - 0.19 x (17-OH-oxa)]
= -2.79

where
3α-KNA = Total Testosterone
11-oxa = Total 11-oxosteroids
17-OH-oxa = 17-hydroxycorticosteroids

This was used to differentiate between patients
and controls with an accuracy of 80%. Patients
with inoperable lung cancer and a low discriminant
score (-2.46) compared with those with resectable
lung tumours (mean score +3.5, S.D. 1.9) did not
survive much into the suggested three-year limit of
the function. It is possible that some patients with
undifferentiated lung cancer (some colon [?] type)
may have a better prognosis than others. These
patients therefore it was of interest to follow-up
those patients with inoperable lung cancer and low
discriminant scores, to see if they had negative
tumour markers. We report here the results of such a
follow-up.

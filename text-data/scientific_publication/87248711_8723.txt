ABSTRACT

Cigarette smoke passed through saline produces a solution which has
been reported to induce DNA SB in cultured cells (Nakayama et al., Nature
314:462, 1985). Since it is most desirable to conduct such studies under
conditions which accommodate the dynamic physicochemical character
of fresh cigarette smoke, an in vitro system adapted from that described
by Valentine (J. Tox. Env. Hlth. 16:115, 1985) was employed to permit the
direct exposure of CHO-K1 cells to freshly-generated smoke from KI4F
cigarettes. Direct smoke-cell contact was achieved by rotating cell
dishes on an inclined platform within a smoke-filled chamber; DNA SB
were assessed by the alkaline filter elution method. The area of the cell
monolayer swept by direct smoke exposure correlated with the extent of
DNA SB. A time- and concentration-dependent incidence of DNA SB was
observed in the absence of exogenous 5% CO mix for smoke exposures of
10-30 minutes and levels of 200-520 mg/m³ total particulate matter.
Filtration or electrostatic removal of smoke particulates indicated that
constituents of both the vapor and particulate phases of smoke contribute
to DNA SB induction by fresh, whole smoke. This direct cell exposure
technique constitutes an informative approach to the study of an array of
cellular responses to complex aerosols such as cigarette smoke.

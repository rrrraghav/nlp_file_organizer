Studies on the Deposition and Distribution of Catechol from Whole Smoke in
BCIF1/Cum Mice. HWANG, K. K., SONKO, O., DANSIE, D. R., KOURI, R. E., and HENRY,
C. J. (1983). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 64, 405–414. Tritiated catechol has been used to
follow the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of inhaled chemicals in cigarette smoke in
BCIF1/Cum mice. The presence of [¹⁴C]catechol in the whole was verified by slice gel
electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography, and its quantitation by gas
spectrometry. Mice were exposed to 10% (v/v) ¹⁴C cigarette smoke on the Walton Horizontal
Smoking Machine under conditions of 35 ml/min volume, 2 sec/puff, 10 puffs/cigarette.
The deposition and distribution of inhaled catechol was determined in all internal
tissues, urine, and feces. Data showed that clearance was occurring during the 10-min smoke
exposure period. Approximately 94% of the radioactivity was found in the lung,
blood, with 10% found in the lung, and approximately 10% in the respiratory tract. Over 91%
of the total dose was recovered in the urine and feces. We conclude that catechol in smoke is
rapidly absorbed, distributed, and excreted from mice exposed to whole cigarette smoke.

Catechol, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, is present
in tobacco leaf (Matsubina et al., 1979)
and is the most abundant phenol in tobacco
smoke (Wold et al., 1966). The concentra-
tion of catechol in main stream smoke ranges
from 0.08 to 0.28 mg/cigarette (Brunne-
mann et al., 1978; Gfroerer et al., 1980).
Catechol is also formed as a result of the
degradation of dopamine and norepinephrine
during cigarette smoking (Rohrbaugh &
Jarvis, 1965). The effect of catechol in
cigarette smoke on the health of man and
animals is not well known. However, it has
been reported that catechol is a potent
inducer of sister chromatid exchange and
delays cell division in cultured human
lymphocytes.

It has been suggested that reduction
of catechol to smoke might be ex-
ploited in cigarette smoke containment with
lead to a more attractive end product for
man. To investigate this, we have used ¹⁴C
catechol to trace the fate of inhaled cata-
chol and its metabolites in BCIF1/Cum mice,
an animal model that exhibits spontaneous
development of lung adenocarcinomas (Henry
et al., 1976).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals—Male BCIF1/Cum mice, aged 8–10 weeks, were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.

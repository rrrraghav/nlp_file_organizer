1,3-Butadiene and two major genotoxic metabolites 3,4-epoxybutane (EB) and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane
(DEB) were evaluated for their ability to induce DNA damage in mammalian cells.  It is difficult

induction were assessed in cultured human lymphocytes.  UDS was measured in vivo using rat and mouse
bone marrow cells following a single exposure. This part of the study is necessary because 1,3-butadiene
is known to be metabolized to genotoxic compounds. UDS was also measured in bone marrow from
mouse hepatocytes following in situ exposure. Likewise, UDS in rat and mouse hepatocytes in vitro was not
observed when using TA1535, TA98, or TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium.  However, UDS was observed with
TA1535, TA98, TA88, and TA100 and employing rat, mouse, and human liver S9 metabolic systems were
observed when using the TA1537 strain.  The results indicate that 1,3-butadiene is a weak genotoxin.

exposure.

Experimental Design
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breed-
ers, Wilmington, MA) were used in all in vivo experi-
ments.  The animals were 6–8 weeks old and weighed
175–225 g at the time of exposure.  Swiss mice (Jacobs
Laboratory Animals, Inc., Meriden, CT) were also used
in in vivo experiments. The mice were 6–8 weeks old
and weighed 20–30 g at the time of exposure.

Chemicals
1,3-Butadiene was obtained from Matheson Gas Products
(Basking Ridge, NJ).  EB and DEB were synthesized as
described previously [24].

Results

Sister Chromatid Exchange in Human Lymphocytes

SCE frequencies were significantly elevated in cultured
human lymphocytes exposed to 1,3-butadiene (Figure 1).
The dose-response relationship was linear up to 64 ppm.
At concentrations above 64 ppm, the SCE frequency
appeared to plateau.  The maximum SCE frequency
observed was approximately 8 per cell.  EB and DEB
also induced SCEs in human lymphocytes, but at con-
centrations significantly higher than those required for
1,3-butadiene (Figure 1). The relative potency of the
three compounds appears to be 1,3-butadiene > EB >
DEB.

Unscheduled DNA Synthesis in Rat and Mouse Bone Marrow

UDS was measured in vivo in rat and mouse bone mar-
row cells following a single exposure to 1,3-butadiene
(Figure 2).  A dose-dependent increase in UDS was ob-
served in both species. The maximum UDS observed
in rats was approximately 80 cpm per cell at a dose of
50 ppm.  The maximum UDS observed in mice was ap-
proximately 60 cpm per cell at a dose of 25 ppm.

UDS in Mouse Hepatocytes In Vitro

When using TA1537, UDS was observed in mouse hepato-
cytes in vitro (Figure 3).  The results indicate that the
genotoxic potential of 1,3-butadiene is dependent on
metabolic activation.

Discussion

The data presented here demonstrate that 1,3-butadiene
is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo.  The results also indi-
cate that the genotoxicity of 1,3-butadiene is dependent
on metabolic activation. The relative potency of the three
compounds appears to be 1,3-butadiene > EB > DEB.

The fact that SCE frequencies plateaued at concentrations
above 64 ppm suggests that there may be a saturation
effect.  This could be due to a limited number of sites
available for DNA damage or it could be due to the
inability of the cells to repair the damage as quickly as
it is being induced.

The results from the UDS assays are consistent with the
results from the SCE assays. Both assays show that 1,3-
butadiene is genotoxic in vivo and that the genotoxicity
is dependent on metabolic activation.

The data presented here have important implications for
the risk assessment of 1,3-butadiene exposure.  The fact
that 1,3-butadiene is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo sug-
gests that it may be carcinogenic in humans.  However,
the relatively low levels of genotoxicity observed in these
assays suggest that the cancer risk associated with 1,3-
butadiene exposure may not be as high as previously
thought.

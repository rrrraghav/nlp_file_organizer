Levels of auto and hemoglobin pyridylbutylation were determined in F344 rats treated with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (5-[HNNC(O)CH3]-3-pyridyl-1-butanone; 4-HPB) or 5-[HNNC(O)CH3]-3-pyridyl-1-butanone N-oxide (5-HNPB). The DNA adducts of 4-HPB and 5-HNPB were also measured. Adducts were detected in tissues from rats treated with pyridyl-nitrated NNK [5-(7)-
NN(O)CH3] or NNNC(O)CH3]. The relative abundance of these adducts is unknown, in the case of DNA, adducts are measurable and 4-HPB can be released by thermal or acid hydrolysis of the DNA (1). Some of the globin adducts are also released during acid hydrolysis.

These unstable adducts account for 15–40% of the total adducts present in tissues from rats treated with NNK. The same adducts are observed in animals treated with N-nitrosoNornicotine (NNNO), another tobacco-specific nitrosamine (2, 3).

These studies demonstrate that α-hydroxylation of NNK generates a reactive species capable of interacting covalently with cellular macromolecules. A sensitive and specific assay was developed to measure the levels of 4-HPB released from hemoglobin in rats treated with NNK. This assay assumes DNA adduct exposure is closely tied and HNNC(O)CH3] has an individual ability to react with proteins. The metabolites, 4-HPB and 5-HNPB, of NNK and NNNO (3) and may also be present in tobacco smoke.

The levels of auto and hemoglobin pyridylbutylation were determined in F344 rats treated with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (5-[HNNC(O)CH3]-3-pyridyl-1-butanone; 4-HPB) or 5-[HNNC(O)CH3]-3-pyridyl-1-butanone N-oxide (5-HNPB). The levels of total binding and 4-HPB adducts are also estimated from labeled NNK.

The data show that the globin adducts, 4-HPB and 5-
HNNC(O)CH3], appeared similar to those observed during treatment with pyridyl-nitrated NNK. The levels of total binding were approximately equal in rats treated with 4-HPB and 5-HNPB.

The incubation of hemoglobin with [14C]NNK or [14C]5-
HNNC(O)CH3] resulted in the formation of 4-HPB adducts. The levels of 4-HPB adducts were also determined in DNA isolated from the liver, lung, and kidney.

The data show that the relative abundance of 4-HPB and 5-
HNNC(O)CH3] adducts varies depending on the tissue.

Materials and Methods

Animals and Treatment
Female F344 rats (21–23 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Rats were housed in plastic cages with albescent bedding and maintained at 22 ± 2°C with a 12-hr light/dark cycle.

NNK and 5-HNPB were prepared as previously described (4).
[Methyl-14C]NNK was obtained from DuPont NEN Research Products (Lexington, MA) in 98% radiochemical purity.

Results

Auto and Hemoglobin Pyridylbutylation
Rats were treated with NNK or 5-HNPB at doses of 50 mg/kg body weight administered by intraperitoneal injection three times per week for 2 weeks. Auto and hemoglobin pyridylbutylation levels are shown in Table 1.

DNA Adducts
The DNA adduct levels are shown in Table 2. The data show that the relative abundance of 4-HPB and 5-HNPB adducts varies depending on the tissue.

Discussion

The results demonstrate that NNK is metabolized to 4-HPB and 5-HNPB, which can then react with DNA to form covalent adducts. These adducts are detectable in tissues from rats treated with pyridyl-nitrated NNK or NNNO (2, 3).

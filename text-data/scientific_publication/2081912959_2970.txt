Abstract

Laboratory trials have demonstrated the efficacy of nicotine replacement in smoking cessation but absolute
success rates are low. For many, nicotine gum is hard to use and transdermal nicotine is slow-acting and
patchy. A self-administered nicotine nasal spray (NNS) can provide readily self-administered relief from
nicotine withdrawal. The NNS has been shown to be effective in reducing craving and withdrawal symptoms.
Fifty-five smokers were randomized to NNS or a placebo. Drug was taken as needed for 32 days,
followed by a 6-month follow-up at 6 months and 1 year. Continuous abstinence (CO = 8 ppm) was assessed
at weeks 0, 2, and 4, 6 months, and 1 year. Continueous abstinence analyses (p < 0.001) and all test
intervals. Differences at key intervals between arms were: week 0, 53% vs 39% (p = 0.03); week 2, 47% vs.
28% (p < 0.001); week 4, 34% vs. 13% (6 months), 23% vs. 10% (6 months) and 18% vs. 9%
(1 year). Side effects were mild and tolerable. The NNS appears to be a useful adjunct in smoking cessation
(approximately 30% of smoking halts. Hard-core/habitual relapses peaks during the day 1, day 5 and
3 weeks after onset. It is concluded NNS is safe, efficacious and a viable alternative treatment for
smoking cessation.

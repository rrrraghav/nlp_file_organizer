Hereditary Ovarian Cancer



Heterogeneity in Age at Onset

Background. Hereditary ovarian cancer (HOC) is
manifested with a variety of clinical syndromes,
namely, hereditary site-specific ovarian cancer, heredit-
ary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, and Lynch
syndrome II. Ovarian cancer, in accord with all Lynch
varieties of adult onset cancer, displays an increasing in-
cidence with advancing age; it shows an earlier
age of onset in hereditary settings.

Methods. Detailed medical and pathology studies
were performed on extended pedigrees, with pedi-
grees, with special attention given to age at ovarian
cancer onset.

Results. The age of onset of ovarian cancer is heter-
ogeneous, wherein the average age of onset in HBOC is 52
years, in the Lynch syndrome II it is 45 years,
contrast its occurence in the general population, at an
average age of 59 years.

Conclusions. These differences are important for
the initiation of surveillance and management strategies.
The age of onset of ovarian cancer differs in these sev-
eral hereditary subsets are less striking than they are in
the case of other integral forms of cancer in the respec-
tive syndromes, such as the breast in the HBOC syn-
drome. In addition, the phenomenon of extremely early
age of onset of ovarian cancer is infrequently seen in
HOC when compared to other forms of cancer, such as
the breast in HBOC or the colon in Lynch syndrome II.
Knowledge about age at onset hereditary in HOC may
harbor important clues about etiology, pathogenesis, and
cancer control.

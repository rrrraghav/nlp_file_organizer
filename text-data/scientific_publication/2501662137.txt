Tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking habits were ob-
served from 1948 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and 450 hospital controls. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) was measured in serum of [patients] & con-
trols. A significant association was found between HBsAg pos-
itivity, as well as the presence or absence of chronic active
hepatitis and smoking habits. The relative risk (RR) for HCC
among HBsAg positive subjects was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.47–
2.54). A significant association was also found between smok-
ing and HCC, particularly in non-HBsAg positive subjects.
The RR for HCC among smokers was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.30–
2.67). Alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of
HCC, especially in HBsAg negative subjects. The combined
effect of HBsAg positivity and smoking may elevate the risk
development of HCC indicating that HBV may promote
tumorigenesis in susceptible individuals. The role of alcohol
appears to be more important in non-HBsAg positive sub-
jects. A significant interaction was observed between smok-
ing and alcohol consumption, suggesting a synergistic effect
in the development of HCC.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common cancer in males and the seventh in females [1]. The
incidence of HCC varies considerably among different geo-
graphical regions, being particularly high in Asia and Africa
[2]. Several factors have been implicated in the etiology of HCC,
including chronic viral hepatitis B infection, aflatoxin exposure,
alcohol consumption, smoking, and genetic predisposition [3–6].
In Greece, HCC is a major health problem. The incidence rate
is among the highest in Europe [7]. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection is endemic in Greece, with approximately 5% of the
population being chronic carriers of HBsAg [8]. Tobacco smok-
ing is also highly prevalent in Greece, with about 40% of men
being smokers. Alcohol consumption is relatively high as well.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association be-
tween HBV infection, smoking and alcohol consumption and
the risk of HCC in a population-based case-control study in
Greece.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
In this case-control study, cases were patients with a final
diagnosis of HCC admitted to hospitals in Athens (Greece) dur-
ing the period 1978–1984. Hospital controls consisted of pa-
tients and cancer hospital). During the first 2 years of the
study, all consecutive admissions were considered; later, only
included, but during the last 6 months collaboration was dis-
continued due to logistic difficulties. A total of 300 cases
interviewed and a sample of their blood samples for HBsAg
testing was obtained. Controls consisted of 215 hospital pa-
tients with available and serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP)
values. The mean age of the cases was 59 years, while con-
trols were significantly younger (48 years). Cases had a his-
tory of cirrhosis (36%), chronic active hepatitis (27%) or other
liver diseases (17%). HBsAg was tested by immuno-radio-
metric assay. Alcohol consumption was classified as non-
drinkers, moderate drinkers (< 60 g ethanol/day) and heavy
drinkers (> 60 g ethanol/day). Smoking habits were classi-
fied as never smokers, former smokers and current smokers.
Data on smoking habits and alcohol consumption were ob-
tained through a standardized interview questionnaire ad-
ministered by trained interviewers. Relative risks (RR) and
95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using con-
ditional logistic regression analysis.

RESULTS
The prevalence of HBsAg among HCC cases was 38%, com-
pared to 4% in hospital controls (Table 1). The RR for HCC
among HBsAg positive subjects was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.47–
2.54). Smoking habits were significantly associated with HCC,
particularly among non-HBsAg positive subjects (Table 2).
The RR for HCC among smokers was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.30–
2.67). Alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of
HCC, especially in HBsAg negative subjects (Table 3). The
combined effect of HBsAg positivity and smoking may ele-
vate the risk development of HCC indicating that HBV may
promote tumorigenesis in susceptible individuals. The role of
alcohol appears to be more important in non-HBsAg positive
subjects. A significant interaction was observed between smok-
ing and alcohol consumption, suggesting a synergistic effect
in the development of HCC (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Our findings confirm previous observations regarding the asso-
ciation between HBV infection and HCC [9–12]. The high pre-
valence of HBsAg among HCC cases in Greece is consistent
with the endemic nature of HBV infection in this country.
The association between smoking and HCC observed in our
study is also consistent with findings from other studies [13, 14].
The synergistic effect of smoking and alcohol consumption on
the risk of HCC suggests that these two factors may interact to
promote tumorigenesis.

Loss of DNA Mismatch Repair in Acquired Resistance to Cisplatin

Selection of cells for resistance to cisplatin, a well-respected mutagen,
could result in mutations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair and
thereby to resistance to DNA-alkylating agents. Parental cells of the
human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line 2008/C1 expressed hMLH1 when
analyzed with immunoblot. One subline selected for resistance to cisplatin
(2008/R) expressed no hMLH1, whereas another (2008/C15.25) re-
mained parental. The 2008/R cells but not in 2008/C15.25 cells. In
addition, the 2008/R cells were found to be deficient for hMSH2. In
support and had a de-repressed mutation rate in [the] HPFRT locus as
compared to 2008 cells, both of which are consistent with the loss of DNA
mismatch repair. To determine whether the loss of DNA
mismatch repair itself contributes to cisplatin resistance, studies were
performed on a human colon cancer cell line deficient in hMLH1
function, HCT116. A human colon cancer cell line defect in hMLH1
function was 2-fold resistant to cisplatin when compared to a subline
expressing hMLH1. Similarly, the human endometrial cancer cell line HEC59, which expresses no hMSH2,
was 3-fold resistant to cisplatin when compared to a subline expressing
hMSH2 with chromosome 2 that possesses MSSII. Therefore, the selec-
tion of cells for resistance to cisplatin can result in the loss of DNA
mismatch repair, and loss of DNA mismatch repair turn contributes to
resistance to cisplatin.

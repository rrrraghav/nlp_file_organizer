Abstract

The Salmonella mutagenicity assay has been used to investigate the mutagenicity of cigarette smoke and cigarette
smoke condensates. A Kentucky reference cigarette (KIR4F) was selected as a representative of low-tar, low-nicotine
cigarettes sold in the U.S. and to serve as a standard for comparative studies on the chemistry and
biological activities of cigarette smoke components. The objective of this study was to determine if the
mutagenicity of mainstream smoke condensate from the KIR4F, as measured by the Salmonella mutagenicity assay,
was representative of the mutagenicity observed in a representative sample of U.S. cigarettes. Smoke was collected
suffered from the KIR4F and 17 brand types (representing roughly 70% of the total U.S. cigarette market)
using a whole-smoke machine (AHSTMA method, 25 ± 2.5 cigarettes/min, 38 mm Hg pressure, 75 °C, 2 L/min,
250 µg/plate). Revertants/mg condensate were determined by calculating the slopes of the dose-response curves
using linear regression models. Condensate/cigarette/variant was determined by multiplying the
revertants/mg condensate by the mg condensate/cigarette. Significant differences (p < 0.05)
between the mean mutagenicity of U.S. market and KIR4F mainstream smoke condensates in terms of revertants/mg
condensate were observed for several brands. The mutagenicity of the KIR4F was significantly lower than that of
KIR4F’s 1.5 times higher tar yield. This suggests that the mutagenic potential of cigarette smoke is not directly
related to tar yield.

Introduction

Cigarette smoking is a major cause of preventable disease and approximately 380,000 deaths per year in the
United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992). Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000
chemical compounds, many of which are known or suspected carcinogens (Baker et al., 1986; Hoffmann, 1973).

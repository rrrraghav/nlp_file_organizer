INTRODUCTION

Sheldon, et al. (1) identified three components of physique (endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy) and three components of personality (viscerotonia, somatotonia, and cerebrotomia). Endomorphy had a high positive correlation with viscerotonia, but negative correlations with the other two components of personality. Similarly, mesomorphy had a high positive correlation with somatotonia, while ectomorphy had a high positive correlation with cerebrotomia. Cortes and Gatti (2) also found high correlations between the components of physique and Sheldon’s components of personality. However, these findings simply may reflect observer expectancies.

The present investigation was designed to determine whether relationships exist between physique and personality when personality measurement is not contaminated by observer expectancies.

METHODS

Subjects. 63 were 311 Caucasian male medical students who had been given both Rorschach tests and somatotype questionnaires as part of a longitudinal study of precursors of hypertension and coronary disease (3). Of these 311, 225 were found to have a predominance of one component of physique, that is, at least .5 more in one

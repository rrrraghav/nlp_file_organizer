THE ANTICHOLIOSTATIC EFFECT OF CIGARETTES TREATED WITH OXOLAMINE CITRATE

The antimuscarinic and anti-inflammatory action of oxolamine citrate has frequently been demonstrated in humans and in animal experiments. Oxolamine citrate administered orally seems to have a protective effect against the ciliostatic action of cigarette smoke.' In the present investigation, we have studied the effect of cigarettes until they were "smoked" by laboratory animals under conditions which permitted comparisons to be made with control cigarettes.

The method of exposure to cigarette smoke was the same as that used in several previous studies.* The cigarettes were offered at a rate length of 25 cm from the mouth piece, and each puff of cigarette, i.e., volume of each puff was adjusted to 60 ml. The rate of smoking was 1 puff per minute, with a smoke weight of approximately 2 kg. per cigarette. The apparatus used was identical with that employed in the experiments described by Rohrbaugh and colleagues.*

The same tobacco type was used throughout. Oxolamine citrate was added to the tobacco in a concentration of 5 per cent of the cigarette weight. The nicotine content was 1.5 mg. The number of puffs preceding ciliostasis were tabulated.

The results are summarized in Table I. In series 1, the average number of puffs required to produce ciliostasis was 34.8. In series 2, the average number of puffs required to produce ciliostasis was 17.9. A significant difference (p < 0.01) between the two series was found in series 3. Because these differences were so pronounced, statistical calculations of significance were judged to be unnecessary.

For the three series collectively, the mean number of puffs preceding ciliostasis was 39 when oxolamine citrate was added, compared with 48 when no oxolamine citrate was required to produce ciliostasis.

Clearly, therefore, the effect of added oxolamine citrate is to reduce the amount of smoke action in the cat trachea. Several im- portant factors must be considered.

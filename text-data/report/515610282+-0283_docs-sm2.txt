DIRECTIONS FOR USE:

It is a violation of Federal Law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.

Directions are for disease suppression in tobacco production including outdoor seed beds, greenhouse, float-bed systems, and field.

For traditional outdoor seed beds, use 1.0 pound per 100 gallons water (one level tablespoon per gallon). Make spray applications on a 5 to 7 day schedule starting when plants are about the size of a dime and continue applications until transplanting to the field. Use 3 gallons of fungicide mixture grown plants are small and gradually increase to 5 gallons per 900 sq. ft. bed as plants mature.

For greenhouse and float-bed systems, use 1/2 pound per 100 gallons (one level teaspoon per gallon). Spray every 5 to 7 days to the point of run-off. Apply 3 gallons of the fungicide spray mixture on small plants (dime size), gradually increasing the spray volume to 6 to 12 gallons per 1000 sq.ft., as plants enlarge until transplanting to the field. For stem rot control, use enough volume to wet the base of plant stems.

Use in the field only if there is a threat of Blue mold. Mix 2.0 pounds per 100 gallons of water, spray foliage weekly for complete coverage up to a maximum of 100 gallons per acre. Discontinue sprays when first evidence of blue mold no longer exists. Do not spray after appearance of first button or within 21 days of harvest.

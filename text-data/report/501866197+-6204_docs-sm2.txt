REMARKS ON BRONCHIAL CARCINOMA
by
W. Denk

During the last years there have been many papers on lung cancer. It is therefore,
unnecessary to review here consequently this very timely system. In the following,
we shall discuss a few aspects of the total problem and report a few observations
which we have been able to make with the many patients of our Clinic.

There seems to be no question that the absolute number of bronchial carcinomata
has increased. This can be further proved by a few figures.

Gesell reports from Switzerland that the total mortality from cancer has almost
doubled (1.8:1) from 1904 to 1948, while the mortality from lung cancer has in-
creased in the same period 20.7 times. In the United States in 1920, 1.1% of
all deaths due to cancer were due to a bronchial carcinoma, while in 1948 the
figure was already 8.3%.

The figures for the population of the city of Vienna have been put at our dis-
posal by the Central Statistical Office of the city. Total deaths due to cancer
have increased from 1931 to 1938 (21 city districts) 15.3%, and from 1939 to
1951 (26 city districts), they have increased by 16.7%. The deaths from
carcinoma of the respiratory system in men were 15.6% of all cancer deaths in
1931, 20.6% in 1938, and 31.7% in 1951.

For men and women together, the percentage of deaths from cancer of the respira-
tory system as a percentage of total mortality from cancer was 8.66% in 1931,
11.52% in 1938, and 17.9% in 1951. The total mortality of the population of the
city of Vienna due to cancer has increased by one sixth during the last twenty
years; the mortality from cancer of the respiratory system has doubled.

In 1949, 4,70 people per 100,000 inhabitants of the City of Vienna died in
consequence of diseases like such every year; this figure was 568 in 1951, or
1,014. The figure died as a percentage of the total mortality due to cancer.
In 1951, 17.9% of all deaths were referred to the total mortality due to cancer.

These conclusions however, are somewhat limited by the fact that the mortality
data are not available for all groups of the population. The death rate from
cancer exists thus far only in relation to the absolute figures.

We have therefore investigated the incidence and subsequent course in 1000 cases
of bronchial carcinoma treated at our Clinic between January 1931 and December
1951. The results of this investigation are presented below. We have not con-
sidered in this series those patients who died before admission to our Clinic,
nor those who were transferred from other institutions.

Background Information on the Deuel Conference On Lipids

The Deuel Conference on Lipids was organized by a small group of eminent West Coast scientists interested in lipid research, to provide for the western states a conference on lipids similar to the Gordon Conferences. Shortly after it was organized, one of the founders, Harry Deuel, died and the conference was named in his memory. The conference has been held annually since 1955 in various West Coast locations.

Generally the conference is devoted to one or two subjects and both basic and clinical materials are presented. The two and one-half day conference consists of five sessions beginning Wednesday or Thursday morning and running until Friday or Saturday; and is held in late February or early March. Each session is introduced by a speaker chosen for his or her high stature in the field. These speakers review their own and related work. Each re-view is followed by a few small presentations and general discussion of a disease process. Informality and wide interchange of information and views are encouraged by limiting the size of the groups, by the rounded table format, and by not recording or publish-ing the discussions.

Until 1988, the conferences were organized by Dr. L.W. Kinsell, and since that time they have continued under a broadly based rotating leadership. It is our principal policies of the conference have been preserved to maintain the traditions of the conference, to highlight the current knowledge and provide that budget, breadth and quality of speakers.

The 1989 Deuel Conference on Lipids was devoted to “New Approaches to Understanding Atherosclerosis”. The selection of this topic reflects the continuing importance of atherosclerosis as a major health problem and the need for new insights into its pathogenesis. We are indebted to the American Heart Association for their generous support of this conference.

The conference was held at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific Grove, California. The facilities at Asilomar are ideally suited for our purposes, providing an informal atmosphere conducive to discussion and interaction among participants.

We wish to express our appreciation to the staff of the Asilomar Conference Grounds for their assistance in making this meeting a success. We are particularly grateful to Mrs. Mary Ann McNealy for her tireless efforts in organizing the logistical details of the conference.

A FILTER FOR THE SELECTIVE
FILTRATION OF NICOTINE

SUMMARY:
Cacao bean hulls, when used as a filter for smoking materials, have
been shown to selectively remove nicotine from the mainstream smoke.

MEMORANDUM:

In conjunction with another study, cacao bean hull sheets were examined
as a filter material. Cigarettes were prepared from KF tobacco, 85 mm total
length, with a 42.5 mm filter made from cacao bean hull sheets. Suitable
controls were made entirely from KF tobacco. Table 1 shows date.

TABLE 1
SMOKE DATA FOR CACAO BEAN HULL FILTERS

Analysis per cigarette KF control KF with filter
puff count 6.6 8.5
TPM, mg 13.7 13.9
Nicotine, mg 1.61 0.59
TPM, H₂O, mg 1.1 1.1
FTC "tar" mg 11.0 12.1

Analysis per puff
TPM, mg 2.10 1.64
Nicotine, mg 0.246 0.070
FTC "tar" mg 1.68 1.44

Panel members found the test cigarettes mild and acceptable, while the
controls were harsh and strong.

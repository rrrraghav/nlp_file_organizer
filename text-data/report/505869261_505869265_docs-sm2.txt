RETAINED SOLVENTS

ISSUE:

How does the preliminary specification of .50 mg. toluene/CPB and 1.48 mg. total solvent/CPB effect SPA products? Is this specification feasible to produce?

RESULTS:

* Retained solvent levels in Alpha CPB’s:

Full Print   1/3 Print    Spec.
(mg./CPR)  (mg./CPR) (mg./CPR)

Isopropyl Acetate     1.86      .71       —
Isopropyl Alcohol     1.85      .52       —
n-Propyl Acetate      .86       .29       —
Toluene                .25       .00       .50
TOTAL                  4.02      1.60     1.48

(CPB’s at four days aging analysis by Archer R & D)

Ink formulations for SPA crush-proof boxes is given in Attachment 1. These formulations have been reviewed by toxicology and are acceptable.

CONCLUSION:

* Both one-third and full printed boxes meet toluene specifications.

* The one-third printed box is close to spec on total solvents, and can be produced at current specifications.

* The full printed box is out of spec on total solvents, but probability is high that levels can be reduced by the use of the vacuum chamber and/or aqueous top lacquer. Archer R & D will conduct trials to determine effectiveness of these methods in reducing total solvents in the full printed box by mid-October.

* Future specifications will be based on total solvent levels.

All Americans [have an insatiable “sweet tooth” – a monstrous craving for sweets
that now bubbles up almost 27,000 million pounds of sugar per year!

Of the four primary tastes in food—salty, sour, salty and bitter—only sweetness
is pleasant to humans. In the January-February issue of "American Scientist," Dr. I.G.
Benkleison, coordinator of research at Yale Hospital Center, New Haven,
Professor of Public Health Nutrition at Columbia University, writes:

“Sweet foods are a ‘treat’ they are sought for beyond their value in relieving
hunger, and sweet fruits are used far beyond their value in relieving thirst. It would seem
in moments a universal human weakness.”

But this rises also to wonders. The two main wants of our commercial “sweet”
by eats. American can lead to overeats, to nutritional imbalances, as if to nonsensical
dental decay. And it is one thing they are not: they are not able to use insulin, synthetic
chemicals or substitutes for pure-made and clean nutrition—nor are there the risks
that these diets carry by their toxic.

The form in which you consume sugar depends upon your income. So look your
income, the more little over you use directly. How American families use twice as much
table sugar as so far it’s with high-fructose corn.

(Note: enriching “table sugar” a cheap and universally desired article food is
a welcome part of food budgets for lower-income families only economically.)

While – to see effort to buy sort of their own incorporated into restrictive
cornsweet are generally removed from—[in J.R. Allen, Dalles, Fresno, Idaho—
fruits, frozen and canned, juices, even when and relief of reserves, and bottled
to be prepared foods cost money or at least tried as much to suffer pure food!

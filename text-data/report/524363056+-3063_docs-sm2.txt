New Entrants and NPMs

Activity to Date
MSA provisions to level the playing field. 35 states have passed MSA Exhibit "I" legislation which
includes escrow payments, volume adjustment, and NPM adjustment.

Ongoing meetings with state AGs to identify the problem and solutions, and with FTC to urge them to
find labeling not in compliance.

Gaps and Weaknesses
States will have difficulty distinguishing NPM product.

States may have difficulty collecting escrow monies.

15 states have not yet passed Exhibit "I" legislation.

The 4 previously settling states (IL, TX, MS, MN) have little incentive to pass it.

Indians are sovereign nations. It is unclear what, if anything, we or government officials can do, other
than monitoring for possible violations of state and federal regulations.

What Can Be Done
Finalize passage of MSA enabling legislation in remaining 11 MSA states and 4 non-MSA states.

Industry must constantly remind AG’s of necessity to enforce NPM provisions (letters, meetings)

Set up a quarterly Working Group which could include Original and Subsequent Manufacturers, ATF,
trade groups (NACS, NWMA, etc.), and others (NAAG, state revenue e.g.). The Working Group will
assist in:
- reporting regulatory violations, gray market activity
- enforcement of escrow payments and other MSA provisions,
- analysis of other possible solutions.

Participating Manufacturers and retailers must establish a system for reporting the existence of Non-
Participating Manufacturers’ product to state authorities to assist the states in collecting escrow
payments.

Push for state licensing of imported cigarettes. A license would become tool for collecting NPM escrow
payments.

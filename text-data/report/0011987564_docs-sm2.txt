FILE NOTE /ル→Tapan

SUBJECT: discussions in Japan on Monday, December 12.

The following was agreed:

1. A KOOL CPT needs to be put into place as soon as possible in order to gauge our recommended product against the growing SALEM Lights product. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please liaise.

2. It was agreed to conduct group discussions with the younger franchise smokers in order to better evaluate current KENT films. Clearly, the smokers in the previous group discussions were older than the smokers who currently are going to imported American products.

3. It was agreed in principle to put a charcoal filter on KENT Parent King Size and Deluxe as well as raise the delivery to the 15 or 16 mg level. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please make a recommendation on product.

4. It was agreed to introduce KENT Luxury Mild 100’s in hinge lid format at Yen 250/280 in order to upgrade the image of KENT and to compete in the growing 250/280 category.

5. It was agreed to focus our support towards growth in the higher priced segments. Accordingly, Joel Silverstein will revise the spend plan on LUCKY STRIKE to ensure that it is optimal even if this means reducing some support on KENT.

6. Joel Silverstein will review the analyticals on VOGUE and CAPRI Menthol versions. There are trade reports that triers of CAPRI Menthol are returning to VOGUE Menthol, and the region believes that there may be a product difference which explains this. Prior to doing any CPT’s it is necessary to get a full analytical evaluation. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please do the same here and give us a view.

7. Joel Silverstein will prepare a plan for expansion and support of CAPRI for discussion here in Louisville. It is to be here in early January.

8. A capital proposal will need to be developed for the sales force software program. Joel Silverstein will have that here by the first week of January.

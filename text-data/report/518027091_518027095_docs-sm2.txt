► COUPON RETURN PROCEDURES....The Coupon
Management Systems has been discontinued effective
April 1, 1995. All orders for printed coupons should
continue to be reviewed for reasonableness using SIS.
Ensure with increased use of the poget and
notebooks that ordered procedures are in place
for the return of coupons.

Expired Coupons:
Request Division Management to send, to the ROU all
preprinted coupons that will expire. Any coupon that
has expired or is to expire within three months is
considered an expired coupon.
Work with Division Management to ensure that coupons
sent to the ROU are not lost in transit.

To the extent possible, coupons should be accumulated to
a minimum of 50 pounds (total packages) and shipped via
Consolidated Freight with third party billing to RJT. Any
smaller shipments under 50 pounds (total weight
of all boxes) are to be shipped Airborne - Second Day with
third party billing to RJT. Since this is more expensive,
please minimize use of this shipping method. Do not return
coupons via UPS. Please use printed matter as the

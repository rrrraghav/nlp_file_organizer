PROCEDURES FOR WORK GROUP

NOTE: The four general topics presented today for "brainstorming" were
selected as a means of creating structure for our initial planning.
They are not intended to represent necessarily the priority topics
that all of the involved agencies and individuals working toward
the Year 2000 will ultimately agree to address.

“BRAINSTORMING” PROCEDURES

1. The four topics will be briefly overviewed by David Burns, M.D.

2. “Brainstorming” begins after the first morning break.

There will be 30 minutes to brainstorm each of the four topics. Each
of the four facilitators will elicit from the Work Group participants
ideas for priority issues within the four general topics.

3. The objective of each thirty-minute session is to generate as many ideas
as possible.

4. It will not be necessary to either prioritize or evaluate the many ideas
produced regarding each topic.

5. The Work Group will prioritize the issues generated during the “brainstorming”
sessions after the second morning break. Typed copies of the issues/ideas
generated in the four sessions will be distributed to all Work Group
participants for their use in this prioritizing session.

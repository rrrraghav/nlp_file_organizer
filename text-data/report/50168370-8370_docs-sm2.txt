PROJECT SUMMARY: (Include Objective, Approach, Current Plans and/or Progress)
Brief-200 word maximum:

Analytical methods will be developed to separate the naturally occurring stereoisomer l-nicotine from d-nicotine. Attempts to accomplish this will involve the use of high performance liquid and capillary gas chromatographic columns with stationary phases containing optically pure chiral groups. Another approach to be investigated involves the interactions of nicotine with various optically pure chiral acids and separations of the resulting diastereomeric ion pairs by liquid chromatography. A less attractive possibility involves chemical modification of nicotine by an efficient, stereoselective process to a species which can be converted to diastereo-meric derivatives. The resulting derivatives might be separable by liquid or gas chromatographic techniques. Once suitable chromatographic methods have been developed for the micro-scale analysis of d- and l-nicotine, studies will be initiated to accurately determine the degree of conversion of the natural l-isomer to its enantiomer during the burning of tobacco. The comparative metabolism of d- and l-nicotine will also be investigated in rats and mice following administration of the racemic compound. In addition, methods will be developed for preparative-scale chromatographic separations of the enantiomers of nicotine and nornicotine.

claims that smoking is a cause of esophageal cancer.¹

While smoking and esophageal cancer have been statis-

ported worldwide. Investigators who studied esophageal cancer
patterns in Greenland, for example, noted that "there would

tobacco.”²

In northern China, one area has had an extremely high
esophageal cancer rate for centuries. An Australian epidemi-
ologist has noted that theories about the disease occurrence

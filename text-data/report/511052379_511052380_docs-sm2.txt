SED Proj Leader: Daniel Kurtz Make Date: 11/01/90
Prod Location: SEE DESCRIP
Results Needed: 12/20/90

Test Objective:

To determine if there are differences in how visitors perceive generated ETS from eight different products (a conventional machine, six XA prototypes, and one QC prototype).

The results from this test will provide the XA project with product development direction.

Product Descriptions:

PD04009-AB CAMEL LIGHTS 85 product.

PD03886-AB XA prototype with 30% charcoal inner wrap, 6 Coresta CMC outer wrap and CAMEL Lts. blend.

PD03988-AA XA prototype with 50% charcoal inner wrap, 3 Coresta outer wrap (TOD5560) and CAMEL Lts. blend.

PD03988-AB XA prototype with Tobacco inner wrap, Ecusta TOD5504 outer wrap and CAMEL Lts. blend.

PD04022-AB XA prototype with tobacco inner wrap with 6% cutrate, K-C CMC outer wrap and CAMEL Lts. blend.

FL900254-AA XA prototype with 2 Coresta CMC paper, 70% CAMEL Lts. blend with 97-B filler (G7 process, tobacco/charcoal/CaCO3).

FL900266-AB XA prototype with Ecusta 5560 paper, 50% CAMEL Lts. blend with cast sheet filler containing 70% tobacco and 30% charcoal.

CT02119-AD QC prototype with Ecusta 5505 paper (30% CaCO3, 11% magnesium hydroxide, 6% KCl, 6% potassium malate, 2 malic acid, and 2.5% irritation reducer) and CAMEL Lts. 85 blend.

Products will be smoked at an air change per hour from 9:00 am until 11:30 am. Chambers will be set at four air changes penhour on the day before testing. Products will be conditioned prior to testing.

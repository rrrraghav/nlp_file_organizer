Domestic cigarette consumption is projected to decline 3.9% in 1990, following a 4.3% drop in 1989.



Consumption declined at a 2% annual rate between 1984 and 1988; during this period, retail price increases averaged 6.8% per year or about twice the overall inflation rate.

The rate of consumption decline accelerated to 4% in the first half of 1989 and is expected to reach 4.5% for the year. The trend change is attributed to escalating retail prices (up 12.3% versus 1988) resulting from larger manufacturers’ price increases and higher state cigarette taxes.

For 1990, industry consumption is projected at 511.2 billion cigarettes. The decline of 0.9% from 1989 is the result of the continuation of 1989 trends followed by the impact of expected 16¢ per pack increase in the Federal Excise Tax in October.

The full impact of the October 1990 FET increase will be felt in 1991, when consumption is projected to drop by 6.7%.

Longer term, the decline in industry consumption is estimated at 4.0% due to higher retail prices, health concerns, social pressures and restrictions on smoking opportunities.

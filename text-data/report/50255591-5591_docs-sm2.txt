Subject: Collagen Accumulation in Pulmonary Fibrosis

Reviewer: Leon O. Jacobson, M.D.

She states that the central premise of this proposal is that lung collagen accumulation depends on both collagen productive rate and extracellular deposition of collagen. The experiment planned represent an attempt to identify the factors that influence these pivotal steps in lung collagen accumulation. Cultured lung fibroblasts will be studied as a model of collagen accumulation. The plan will be directed toward characterizing the kinetics of rat lung fibroblast procollagen production, proteolytic processing of procollagen and deposition of newly synthesized collagen into extracellular matrix. She plans as well to study the regulation of collagen production and matrix formation and doing so will examine the role of cyclic nucleotides and polyamines as well as the influence of exogenous substances produced by bronchoalveolar macrophages.

Under specific aims she wishes to answer the question - What is the effects of cell density on the kinetics of fibroblast collagen production and matrix formation regulated and finally how is lung collagen accumulation regulated in vivo.

I think her methods and procedures are well written. The budget is not out of reasonable range but she does ask for $10,000 in the first year for permanent equipment.

I rather like this application.

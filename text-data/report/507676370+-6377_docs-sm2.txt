1991 PLAN

NORTH DAKOTA

ROBERT E. PACKLER

SITUATION ANALYSIS

Legislative Session

North Dakota has an 80 day state legislative session in 1991. Profiling of bills took place December 4-6, 1990. A bill banning vending machines was profiled.

The state excise tax on cigarettes was increased from .18 a pack to .27 in July of 1987. Taxes started the year at .30 per pack. A sunset provision taking place on 7/91 will lower the tax by .03 to .27 per pack.

Potential Legislative Action

1) Cigarette Excise Tax Increase: It is likely that a bill to repeal the “Sunset Clause” that lowers the tax on cigarettes .03 per pack and is scheduled to take effect July 1, 1991 will be introduced. It would keep the tax on a pack of cigarettes at .30 per pack. There is also a strong anti-tax sentiment in ND. But a repeal of the Sunset Clause is an easier vote for the legislature than a new tax increase. For this reason, I feel it could pass. The SRGs will be working to fight the repeal.

2) Other Tobacco Taxes: A bill increasing taxes on other tobacco products will likely be introduced. With the strong anti-tax sentiment in ND a vote for an increase in new taxes would be a much tougher vote than a repeal of the Sunset Clause. There is 50/50 chance of this one passing. Any Tax increase is unacceptable to the SRGs and they will be opposing it.

3) Smoking Restrictions: A Clean Indoor Air bill will likely be introduced. Some parts of it could very well pass. The SRGs have fought smoking restrictions in the past and will continue to make this issue a priority.

4) Sampling Ban: There is a 50/50 chance that a bill will be introduced. It is however, unlikely to pass. North Dakota’s are notorious for not wanting Government to interfere with the business community.

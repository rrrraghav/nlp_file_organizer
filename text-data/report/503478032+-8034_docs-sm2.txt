RE: NOW 100 FRANCHISE RISK STUDY

This reports topline results of the NOW Franchise Risk Study. The objectives
of this research were to:

• Determine NOW’s franchise familiarity with the brand's tar level. In
addition, among franchise smokers who correctly playback its tar level,
measure the relative level of dissatisfaction associated with increasing
the product’s tar level to 3mg even though it will deliver more taste
and retain its “lowest” positioning.

• Determine why recent NOW 100 switchers "switched" to other brands.
The primary reason focus on poor taste delivery (e.g., not enough
taste), this would further support the case for increasing the brand’s
tar level from 2 to 3mg.

A. Franchise Smokers

Approximately 62% of NOW's franchisees were able to playback the brand’s
current 2mg tar level. However, this number may be slightly inflated as
the tar level is written on the pack and respondents may have looked at it
during the interview.

Aware of Tar Level*

1mg tar     5.0%
2mg tar    62.1%
3mg tar     1.7%
4-5mg tar   3.7%
Under 1mg tar  9.6%
Don’t know   17.9%

*Question
What is the tar level, in milligrams, of NOW 100 cigarette?

Although there is high awareness of tar content, increasing the tar level
from 2 to 3mg to provide greater taste delivery (while still being the
“lowest 100’s”) appears to pose minimal risk to the brand. Only 13% of the
respondents claimed they would switch to another brand.

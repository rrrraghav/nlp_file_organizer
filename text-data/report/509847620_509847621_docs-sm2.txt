AMES TESTING
Cindy Fulp and Sarah Bess

STATUS: Ten samples were tested for Melanie Stevenson (Growth/improvement of Existing Business 222). These samples were identified as follows: (a) Heritage Full Flavor; (b) Heritage Light 85; (c) Pyramid Full Flavor; (d) Winston Light 85; (e) Best Value 85; (f) Best Value Light 85; (g) Winston King Full
Flavor; (h) Winston Light 85; (i) FL-911198A; and (j) FL-911198B. The purpose of this experiment is to establish a data base of subgeneric products made with and without cellulose in sheet material.
SIGNIFICANCE: Samples were statistically compared on a relevant mg TAR basis as follows: (1) full
flavor products were compared; (2) light products were compared; and (3) the FL-91198 prototypes
were compared. No statistical differences were detected.

STATUS: Five samples were tested for Steve Sohn (New Materials Development 504). All of the products
in this experiment were made in a Full Flavor Non-Menthol configuration using a generic base blend of
G-28B. The differences were in the type of G7 in the base blend. The G7 materials used were as follows:
(a) Control G7-1; (b) G7-4 TPD-429; (c) Regular G7-10; and (d) G7-25 [91-079A]. A current Camel Filter 85 product was also tested. The purpose of this experiment is to establish a data base for heat treating
G7 extract and adding DAP.
SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among these samples.

STATUS: Four samples were tested for Tom Perotti (XB 113). The products in this experiment were
described as follows: (a) Winston King Size (WK SZ) BD containing 25% G7 with the Tobacco-Pad
#4028 applied; (b) Winston Light King Size (WKL SZ) 26% TPH #41407-26, 1 with cave lining; (c)
(d) WKL 4437-2; and (e) WKL TPF 44732-1 applied; and (f) WKL 911198B 25% G7.
SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among these samples.

STATUS: Five samples were tested for Steve Sohn (New Materials Px 110). This experiment is to
establish a data base of subgeneric products made with a Full Flavor, Non-Menthol type product using
a generic base blend of G-28B. The differences were in the type of binder used as a liner. The binders
used were as follows: (a) Control – No Liner; (b) Liner 1 - Paste Binder; (c) Liner 2 - Tissue Liner;
(d) Liner 3 – Pulp Liner; and (e) Liner 4 – Double Tissue Liner.
SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among these samples.

STATUS: Three samples were tested for Tom Perotti (XB 115). The purpose of this experiment is to
establish a data base of subgeneric products made with a generic base blend of G-28B.
SIGNIFICANCE: No statistical differences were detected among these samples.

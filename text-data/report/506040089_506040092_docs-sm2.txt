PROJECT MX QUALITATIVE RESEARCH

(MDD #86-42903)

The purpose of this report is to present findings from recent MX product qualitative research.

BACKGROUND:

PROJECT MX is a tobacco-filtered cigarette developed to appeal to male, non-menthol smokers. Initial qualitative research on 14mg conventional blend products was conducted among FF smokers. This research indicated a problem with too much impact.

As a result of this learning, R&D developed three reduced nicotine blends and two variations of the shredded tobacco filter:

o Blends

    Control-Conventional, high nicotine (A)
    Low nicotine (B)
    Low nicotine with vanilla and chocolate in top dressing (C)
    Low nicotine with increased air dilution (H)

o Filter Variations

    All-tobacco filter
    Combination filter: 15mm tobacco/10mm cellulose acetate
        Control-Cellulose acetate at mouth end (F)
        Tobacco filter at mouth end (P)

These prototypes were examined to aid R&D in determining blend, casing and top dressing direction for future quantitative testing.

METHODOLOGY:

Four focus groups were held on August 4-5, 1986 in Atlanta, Georgia. The all male groups were split on the basis of age (18-34, 35-49) and flavor grouping (FF, FF LT). All the respondents smoked 85% non-menthol brand styles.

Each group was initially exposed to a cigarette identical with the combination filter (C). Since the cellulose acetate portion was at the mouth end, this enabled us to obtain consumer perceptions of what looked to be a standard product. Smokers were then shown the tobacco filter concept (see attachment) without products. Following their comments on the filter itself and their expectations of the product, they were given a cigarette identical to the first with the exception that the tobacco portion of the combination filter was at the mouth end. This was followed by exposure to other prototypes with two color tobacco filter. In addition, smokers were able to visually compare an all-tobacco filter.

DRAFT

The overall objective for the Corporation’s domestic marketing
Group will be to stop the erosion of the Company's market share
and reestablish itself in the tobacco industry as a strong and
viable competitor by stabilizing established brands’ share of
segment and developing and marketing new products in the mainstream,
non-menthol category. To this end, the group’s first priority
will be to launch BARCLAY nationally, assuming satisfactory test
market performance. Additional new product work will continue and
seek other altemative new product opportunities recognizing both
current ultra low tar possibilities as well as new opportunities
which may occur as a consequence of external/environmental changes.

Giving first priority to the launch of a new brand in no way signals
an intent to abandon an aggressive posture with respect to efforts
to minimize the erosion in volume on established brands. KOOL,
in particular, will be managed with heavy marketing resources
focusing on stabilizing the parent in its category and on finding
the competitive edge that will give the low tar styles greater
growth potential. The overall objective for the Corporation’s
established brands is to produce budgeted or better volume within
corporate spending and profit guidelines. In addition, the brands
must pursue an aggressive testing program to demonstrate opportunities
for investing incremental funds in order to build total share of
market.

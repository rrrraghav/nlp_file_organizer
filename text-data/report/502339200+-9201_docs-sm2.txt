SUBJECT: WARNING STATEMENT

TIMING

Inasmuch as the new SALEM newspaper campaign is breaking about May 15 with the Warning Statement, it is desirable for all of our brands using newspaper to also begin using the Warning Statement about the same time. This does not mean that we should scrap existing material or go into overtime in order to accomplish this objective. However, any new units currently being prepared for use in newspaper should include the Warning Statement.

The timing for the appearance of the Warning Statement in magazines and out-of-home media is shown on the attached sheet. The scheduling was agreed to by the Brands as the earliest practical date for use of the Warning Statement in these media.

These timing instructions do not supersede the instructions you have received earlier giving you the final date of compliance, but they are intended to coordinate all brands' scheduling so that the Warning Statement will begin to appear about the same time in all our brand advertising.

Please advise if you have questions regarding this timing.

CHECKING PROCEDURE

The Brand Groups and the agencies have the primary responsibility of insuring that each unit of advertising has the necessary Warning statement and the T and N Legend. The Agencies have been provided with the necessary information for compliance and are taking steps internally to insure that all material will have the necessary warning and T and N Legend. It will be necessary, however, for the Brands to continue to oversee the Agency on these matters.

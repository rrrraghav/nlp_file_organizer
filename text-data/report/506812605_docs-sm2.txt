Restaurant/Workplace ETS Study
March 2, 1988

Objective: To acquire carbon monoxide (CO), respirable suspended
particulates (RSP), ultraviolet particulate matter

including written permission as needed.

4. Data transfer from cassette tape to personal computer will
be performed by Lorillard, Inc. and the data printouts will
be provided to IT.

5. A minimum of 70 samples (35 restaurant/35 office) will be
collected over a five day period.

6. Ambient carbon monoxide concentrations will be acquired for
at least 25 minutes prior to entering the restaurant or
office.

7. Detailed observations (i.e. room dimension, number of
occupants and smokers etc.) will be recorded on a form that
will be provided to the sampling team.

8. A basic engineering/analytical report will be issued to
CIAR. The report will contain a description of the field
sampling, analytical techniques, and a presentation of the

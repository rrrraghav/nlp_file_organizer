MORE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES REPORT

Week of 2/25/85

1) The Brand attended focus groups in Orlando in order to obtain general consumer information which will be used for this year’s positioning and target evaluation process and also for 1986 planning. Groups were conducted among female franchise and target 120's and lights smokers, and male franchise 120's smokers. Focus group results will be forwarded week of 3/4 with Brand’s perspective.

2) The Brand attended the Second Annual MORE Fashion Award auditions at Carnegie Hall in New York. The MORE Fashion Award was established to discover and recognize new fashion talent in America.

Judges Giorgio Sant’Angelo, Willi Smith and Michaela Vollbracht selected five finalists from a field of twenty-four semi-finalists. The five finalists will each present ten designs from their Fall 1985 collections to leading fashion retailers and journalists on 4/29 at the Pierre Hotel in New York. Judges for the final round of competition will include Mary McFadden and Carolina Herrera, in addition to the three designers named above. Hostess for the event will be French film star Catherine Deneuve. The 1985 winner will receive the MORE Fashion Award which was designed by Paloma Picasso.

Preliminary indications are that the press is providing good post-event coverage of the auditions. Articles have already appeared in U.S.A. Today, the Daily News, and the New York Times, with additional coverage expected soon. The Brand will forward copies of all articles to me.

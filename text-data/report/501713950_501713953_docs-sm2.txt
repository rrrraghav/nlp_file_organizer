I. Background History

REAL FILTER and MENTHOL were introduced nationally on 6/13/77, 4½ months ago. REAL is positioned in the fast-growing Hi-Fi category as the only major brand with "nothing artificial added" -- capitalizing on recent consumer interest in all-natural products to differentiate the Brand from all cigarettes. Based on pre-market concept research, low “tar” and good taste are the consumer benefits which make the Brand important to consumers. The Brand is targeted to young adults, especially males, with emphasis on a rich, masculine tone in advertising -- approach distinctly leading versus the more "clinical" pack/copy prominent used by the unique Hi-Fi brands (VANTAGE and Merit). Pre-market research indicated strong and broad-based appeal for REAL, so it received very heavy introductory spending support to capitalize on this potential.

II. Business Review

REAL’s performance thus far in 1977 has been disappointing. Shipments forecasted for total year 1977 are only 66% of the original goal:



                                  Total Year 1977
                                      Volume      SOM
Original Goal                   3.64 bil.     .68

Current Forecast                 2.40 bil.*    .48
(66%)




* Inflated by an estimated net pickup from retailers/ jobbers of 200 million units. Given a heavy initial load-in and lower than expected movement, pickup was required to balance inventories and assure fresh product.

Although REAL’s spending in 1977 was at a significantly high rate versus previous RJR new brand introductions, its impact was somewhat diluted by the national introduction of 19 competitive new brands (all low “tar”) during the year. Importantly, Merit's first year expenditures accounted for a greater share of both low "tar" category and new brand expenditures than did REAL’s.

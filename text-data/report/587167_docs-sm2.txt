BIOVITRO - EIDETE   8n

Protein Denaturation Test

1. Introduction

Under the designation "Biovitro", tests were carried out in which tobacco smoke
and tobacco smoke fractions or individual smoke components were reacted with biochemically
active materials (for example, ferments, protein).

In the year 1938, Rondoni (1) formulated the hypothesis that protein denaturation
and carcinogenesis are independent processes. In the following years, different
researchers held the view that carcinogenesis included small structural changes or
drastic denaturation of biologically active macromolemes. (2,3,4,5,6). That
tannic acid, phenol and thiourea denaturize protein has long been known, (7). In in-
dependent tests it was later shown that these substances lead to liver and skin tumors
(8). Argus et al. (9) recently reported on this theme. As model substances, they used
albumin, whose reaction with water soluble carcinogens - like nitrosamines -
was studied.

This publication (5) was the starting point for our own studies. Since the methods
used by the authors [endimetry, viscosity, and measurement of optical activity]
seemed too insensitive, we used p-chlormercuribenzoate which react specifically with
the - SH - groups. This reaction can be followed by UV spectrometry (10).

2. Principle

Egg albumin reacts at pH 7.0 with p-chlormercuribenzoate:

Protein - SH + Cl. Hg. Ph  → Protein - S - Hg. Ph
                                  HCl

The 3 or 4 - SH - groups react slowly, probably due to steric hindrance (11).
If the solution of albumin is mixed with smoke, the reaction is hastened. It is

The role of alpha, antitrypsin deficiency as a risk factor in the
development of chronic airways obstruction.

The investigator's specific aim is to examine the role of alpha,
antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency as a risk factor in the development of
chronic airway obstruction. The hypotheses to be tested are that

a) M2 heterozygote for AAT deficiency has impaired lung function as
measured by a wide range of tests of lung mechanics and

b) the M2 heterozygote does not belong to the high risk category
for the development of chronic airway obstruction unless there is an
additive factor such as smoking, pollutants etc.

In view of the unusual population available and her expertise, I recommend
continuation at high priority.

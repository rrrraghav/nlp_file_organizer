SUMMARY

The paper recon from Marlboro KS and Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s
were found to be different. The paper recon from Marlboro KS
contained DAP and therefore exhibited the sugar-amine products. The
Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s paper recon did not contain phosphate in
excess of the level typically found in PIS where no DAP was added.
Therefore, the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s
(80-35%) in the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s.

It has not been proven that the furnish for the two papers were
alike to be thought. The furnish for the paper recon found
in Marlboro KS was thought to be heavily skewed toward burley while
the furnish for the Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s was thought to be
skewed toward flue-cured furnish.

A comparison of the page and dark recons from Marlboro KS were also
made. This comparison showed that paper recon exhibited most of the
sugar-amine reaction products found in the dark recon and in about
the same quantities. The major differences were found in the volatile
alkyl pyrazines region of the FTIR profiles.

INTRODUCTION

Bob Johnson had isolated the paper recons from Marlboro KS and Marlboro
Menthol Lights 100’s. These materials, along with the dark recon from
Marlboro KS, were examined by purge-and-trap (P&T) and direct
injection GC/MS. The P&T analysis for determination of trimethylamine
and other volatiles from the alkylpyrazines decomposition and
fructosaners. Data from both of the analyses were used to reach the
conclusions drawn in this file note.

HC-Chromo-Sister Chrom In Vitro
October, 1983

I. PURPOSE

The sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay detects the ability of a chemical to enhance the exchange of DNA between two sister chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. The test may be performed in vitro, using, for example, rodent or human cells, or in vivo mammals, for example, rodents such as mice, rats and hamsters.

II. DEFINITION

Sister chromatid exchanges represent reciprocal interchanges of the two chromatid arms within a single chromosome. These exchanges are visualized during the metaphase portion of the cell cycle and presumably require enzymatic incision, translocation and ligation of at least two DNA helices.

III. REFERENCE SUBSTANCES

Not applicable.

IV. TEST METHOD

A. Principle

Following exposure of cell cultures to test chemicals, they are allowed to replicate in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), followed by treatment with colchicine or colcemid to arrest cells in a metaphase-like stage of mitosis (c-metaphase). Cells are then harvested and chromosome preparations made. Preparations are stained and metaphase cells analyzed for SCEs.

B. Description

In vitro SCE assays may employ monolayer or suspension cultures of established cell lines, cell strains or primary cell cultures. Cell cultures are exposed to test chemical and are allowed to replicate in the presence of BrdU. Prior to harvest, cells are treated with a spindle inhibitor (e.g., colchicine or colcemid *) to accumulate cells in c-metaphase. Chromosome preparations from cells are made, stained and analyzed for SCEs.

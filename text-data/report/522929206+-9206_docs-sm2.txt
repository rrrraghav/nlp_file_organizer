TOTAL SMOKING BAN

A. ESTIMATED ADH COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION

1. Food service establishment permits, statewide, (as of 12/19/00): 8,140

2. Based on a percentage derived from our current complaint investigation load, it is estimated that 1,221 complaint investigations were handled statewide during the 6-month period from January 1 to July 1, 2000.

3. Anticipating a statewide increase of 10 TO 25% in the number of complaint investigations during the first year after implementation, it is estimated that the smoking regulation will result in from 122 to 610 additional complaint investigations.

4. Each complaint will require approximately 3 hours’ investigation time (including travel and follow-up). Travel distance will average 15 miles per investigator.

> Estimated mileage reimbursement cost @
   29 cents per mile: 15 miles per investigation    531       2,864
> Estimated cost of additional investigations $  9,063     $  45,317

6. Re-allocation of existing resources (to address the anticipated increase in complaints resulting from the food service establishment smoking regulation) will likely have an impact on our ability to carry out current ADH food safety initiatives.

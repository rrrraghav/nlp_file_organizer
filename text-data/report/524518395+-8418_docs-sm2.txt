TITLE OF REPORT: 52 Week Dietary Toxicity Study in Dogs

AUTHORS: R. Goburdhun and R.J. Greenough

REPORT ISSUED: November 1, 1991

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: In a 1-year chronic toxicity study, dimethomorph (tech., 96.6%
a.i.) was administered to four male and four female dogs at dose levels in the diet at
concentrations of 0, 150, 450 or 1350 ppm (equivalent to doses of 0, 4.0, 12.0,
and 36.0 mg/kg/day for males and 0, 3.5, 10.5, and 31.5 mg/kg/day for females), in a
105-day/14-day dosing schedule.  No adverse effects were observed at the study
limit dose (31.5 mg/kg/day) in females. The no-observed-adverse-effect level in male
rats were 15.0 mg/kg/day, based on slight elevations of serum triglycerides above
control values, increased relative liver weight, and hepatocellular hypertrophy at
36.0 mg/kg/day.

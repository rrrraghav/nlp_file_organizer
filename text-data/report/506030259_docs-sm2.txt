SUBSTRATE DEVELOPMENT:

A technical meeting is scheduled for this Thursday, July 9, with Mr. Joe Porinchak. The primary topics of discussion are:

1. Results of RJR’s physical and performance analysis
of recent samples. These results will be used to
plan future technical development direction.
2. Determine a schedule for future development.
3. Discuss results with flow agents and plan a
development schedule for obtaining production
quantities of Sylold with larger particle size.

An extended test run on the Bosch capsule filling
machine started this morning, 7/6. The test run is using
Grace D2 substrate, with the Tox. II load. Grace Sylold 63
FF is applied, by hand at 0.6% by weight, as a flow agent
just before actual use. The material was loaded in Shed 112.

ALCOA: The material produced by Alcoa at Fuller, early in
June, was received at Lawrence Transfer, late last week. A
total of nine drums were received, equaling a little less
than 3,100 lbs. This material will be brought to 602-4 early
this week and drum samples will be submitted for complete
physical analysis.

KAISER: A technical meeting was held at Kaiser’s facility in
Bat Rouge on June 30. The discussion resulted in the
following development schedule:

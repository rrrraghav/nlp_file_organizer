SMOKING MACHINE CONTROL PROGRAM NOTES

The current version of the 731T exposure control program was written to control two Geneva smoking machines which have been modified to allow the computer to disable their cigarette feeder and unloader functions. The program controls the “remember” function enabling one of the load/unload functions when that function is required and must "remember" the age and location of each cigarette throughout the exposure to ensure that spent cigarettes are replaced at the proper time. The product smoking machine has two igniters that are controlled by the computer in addition to the loader and unloader, the reference smoking machine has none. The computer also times the duration of each exposure, automatically records CO monitor readings, and controls filter and impactor samples. A real-time aerosol monitor was recently added to the exposure system and a subroutine may be written to record these readings also.

The control program has been written as a series of subroutines that fall into one of the following three categories - EXPOSURE CONTROL, FUNCTION CONTROL, or SUPPORT. Following is a brief description of the subroutines:

EXPOSURE CONTROL SUBROUTINES:

SUBROUTINE PARM
Loads required parameters from the data tables into memory.

SUBROUTINE LABL
Allows the operator to enter information into the program before the initiation of an exposure. The information may include which machine will be loaded with product and which with reference, the exposure concentration, or it either member will not be used during an exposure cycle. The computer will record this information in the exposure summation or will “ignore” a machine that was not used for exposure.

SUBROUTINE LODE
Loads the carousel following a prescribed pattern and maintains the carousel by replacing cigarettes after they have puffed the required number of times. The computer leaves LODE when a "start exposure" signal is received and transfers control to subroutine EXPS. LODE functions through the following “function Control Subroutines”:

* EJCA which controls machine #1
* UCA which controls machine #1 ejector
* TCHA which controls machine #1 torch #1 and it’s associated auxiliary puff port
* TCJB which controls machine #1 torch #2
* EJCB which controls machine #2 ejector
* JCB which control machine #2 injector

SUBROUTINE EXPS
Continues to maintain the carousels by using the same subroutines used by LODE but also turns smoke on to allow the machine, takes measurements, and controls various sample apertures are required during an exposure. At the end of the prescribed exposure period exposure stops and the carousel unloads. Control then transfers to subroutine SUMP. EXPS uses following “function control subroutines” in addition to those used by LODE:

* TCCA which controls machine #1 torch #1
* TCDB which controls machine #1 torch #2
* SJCA which controls machine #1 sampler
* SJCB which controls machine #2 sampler

SUBROUTINE SUMP
Summarizes the exposure data and prints a summary of the exposure. Transfers control back to PARM.

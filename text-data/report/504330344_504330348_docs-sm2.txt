ITEM 3

PLANS AND PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE ACTIVITIES

3.1 Information Services

The monitoring network on international and national
developments will be further developed.

Periodic outgoing information will be structured in four
reports:

1. Monthly abstracts of publicly accessible material
   (INFOTOPICS)
2. Conferences and events (INFOGRAM)
3. NMA action and programs (INFOBRIEF)
4. Briefing papers on specific issues

Consideration is being given to a fifth periodical report
on legislation.

The information base will be expanded further, focusing on
priority issues.

Support to project teams will be increased progressively as
soon as the staff’s workload allows.

The staff's orientation program will be continued.

3.2 Regional Coordination

A project team has reviewed NMAs in Asia and Latin America
to identify priority countries in which new NMAs are needed
or existing NMAs need substantial development. Four
countries in Latin America were recommended (see 2.4.2
above); other Latin American NMAs are in need of help, but
did not meet all criteria of the selective process. It is
hoped that the special assignment to four countries in
Latin America will be agreed and supported by the member
companies concerned and their affiliates.

Project members also identified significant weak areas in
Asia where INFOTAB help is needed, including Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore.

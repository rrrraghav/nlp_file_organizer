Sidestream Comparison of Alpha TM-6 Cigarettes and 1RAF

Reference Cigarettes Using Capillary Gas Chromatography

and Mass Selective Detection

OBJECT:

To compare the sidestreams produced by Alpha TM-6
cigarettes and 1RAF reference cigarettes using capillary gas
chromatography and mass selective detection.

SUMMARY:

The sidestream smoke (smoke from the lit end) of Alpha
TM-6 cigarettes and 1RAF reference cigarettes were collected
using the Harris Total Smoke Chamber (see Figure 1) at six
sampling points: the upper chamber of the smoking apparatus,
two Cambridge filter pads in series, and three methanol cold
traps. All smokings were performed under PFC conditions.
Solutions obtained at each sampling point containing a known
amount of internal standard (quinoline) were examined via
temperature programmed capillary gas chromatography using
mass selective detection. Visual comparison of the resulting
chromatograms showed the TM-6 sidestream to be considerably
less complex than the 1RAF sidestream at every sampling
point.

Quantitation of the resulting peaks (relative to the
internal standard) showed that the TM-6 sidestream contains
fewer components (94% less in the particulate phase and 82%
less in the vapor phase) and less total material (97% less
in the particulate phase and 84% less in the vapor phase) than
the 1RAF sidestream. A summary of the number of peaks and
total amount of material round is shown in Table I.
Interpretation of the available mass data produced thirty-one

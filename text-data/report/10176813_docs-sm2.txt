"Endocrine Functions of the lungs"

This is an imaginative proposal, with some preliminary work already completed to indicate feasibility, for demonstrating cellular localization of converting enzyme. It has been shown to cleave bradykinin and contrarily, to activate angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Both of these activities are part of the “renin-angiotensin” function of the lung, which in this instance is shown to be a hormonal control organ capable of affecting distant, in fact general, function. Dr. Ryan presents evidence to support her claim that the conversion proceeds in the capillary endothelium of small pulmonary vessels, and that this is a totally new mechanism of hormonal small-vation; this last can be argued.

The methods to be applied are immuno-histochemical localization. For this purpose special procedures for conjugating horseradish peroxidase with antibody to converting enzyme will be applied to specially fixed morsellated lung tissue in vitro.

Critique:

The procedures outlined are appropriate and represent an interesting combination of biochemical and immunological methods. Quite rare interest is made at several points to calling, and to other work on localization of nicotine and metabolites to smoke, also progressing in our laboratory. It is quite possible that smoking may affect the enzymatic conversion process in the lung of certain important hormones. This proposal in a way can be considered as preliminary for such investigations at a basic level. It is, however, unnecesary for actual practical investigation of converting enzyme in the lung.

In order to determine the source of the nicotine-derived
4-(methylnitrosamino)-4-(3-pyridyl)butyric acid (iso-NNAC) in
tobacco smoke, an American blend and one French dark tobacco
nonfilter cigarettes were spiked with nicotine, norcotinine,
cotinine and iso-NNAC (10, 1, 2, and 1 ng/cig., respective-
ly). Smoke generation, collection and particifation were ac-
cording to a published method. The analysis of tobacco-specific
nitrosamines (TSNAs), nitrosamino acids (NAA’s) and iso-NNAC in
mainstream smoke (MS) was done by gas chromatography with TDA
detection. The U.S. blended cigarettes spiked with iso-NNAC
yielded 950 ng/cig. of iso-NNAC in US 0.95% transfer, while
formation of iso-NNAC (2 ng/cig.) was observed only in the MS
cigarettes spiked with cotinine. The latter finding suggests
that iso-NNAC may be pyrogenythesized during smoking of ciga-
rettes rich in cotinine. Data on iso-NNAC formation from coti-
nine in tobacco plants and in vitro will be presented. The pos-
sibility of using iso-NNAC as a Biomarker for the exposure to
TSNA of active and passive smokers will be discussed.

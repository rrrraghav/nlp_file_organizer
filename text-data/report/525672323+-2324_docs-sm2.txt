OSHA

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), of the United States Department of Labor, has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on indoor air quality (IAQ) and tobacco smoke. It would impose broad requirements on employers regarding air quality and the operation and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It would effectively prohibit smoking in indoor public places.

Smoking would be banned in restaurants, bars, private clubs, retail establishments, office buildings, government buildings, bingo parlors, bowling alleys, casinos, hotels and motels, sports arenas, and every other indoor space except residences. It is the most far-reaching proposed smoking restriction in history, and would override every less restrictive state and local restriction currently on the books.

It would apply to EVERY workplace, regardless of size, with the exception of sole proprietorships (one self-employed person, with no employees).

The only “concession” to the reality that 45 million adult Americans smoke is a provision for smoking areas which are so burdensome they are unlikely to be provided by more than a handful of employers, if any. Smoking could legally take place only in separate, designated non-work areas, which are maintained (ventilated) at a negative pressure compared to surrounding areas and separately exhausted to the outside. Further, no employees could enter the area for work purposes.

In other words, if this rule is allowed to take effect, there will no longer be a single bar or restaurant anywhere in America (with the possible exceptions of Indian reservations, the United Nations) and foreign embassies and consulates) in which you can whenever food or drink while smoking a cigarette (or pipe, cigar, whatsoever).

ANALYSIS OF THE GASEOUS PHASE OF CIGARETTE SMOKE

A number of analyses were performed on the gaseous components
of tobacco smoke during the first half of the twentieth century,
but it was not until the 1950's, when the availability and wide-
spread use of more sophisticated quantitative instrumentation made
it possible to determine very minute concentrations, that the major
contribution concerning the vapor phase composition appeared in
print. Until this time, the emphasis had been placed on the
particulate matter of cigarette smoke, which comprises little more
than one-twentieth of the whole smoke.

The analysis of cigarette smoke, composed of atmospheric
gases and a complex mixture of substances derived from the combus-
tion and pyrolysis of tobacco, poses a difficult problem. For
purposes of analysis, it is convenient to separate these substances
into a particulate phase and a gaseous phase. Several gas filtering
materials have been reported that remove over 99 per cent of the
smoke particulate matter. However, a glass fiber filter medium,
Cambridge Filter No. CN-115 (Cambridge Filter Corporation, Syracuse,
New York), most nearly meets the requirements for quantitative
studies. This filter, originally studied by Wartman, Cogbill and
Barlow [31], removes about 99.8 per cent of the particulate phase
and has the added advantage of a high loading capacity without
developing a resistance to air flow sufficient to alter the puff

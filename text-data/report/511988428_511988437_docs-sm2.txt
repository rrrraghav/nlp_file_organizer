MARKETING ISSUES

1. When will you introduce this cigarette?

When it is ready and when we are convinced that smokers will like it.

2. How will you know?

I’m not going to speculate on that.

3.

We developed it because it's clear the public wants less second-hand smoke. Research clearly shows that smokers are concerned about the issue of secondhand smoke and that they hope companies such as ours can do something about it. Before we introduce this new cigarette, we will be certain it provides the taste and smoking pleasure that many smokers enjoy. We believe smokers will also appreciate the benefits of a 90 percent reduction in second-hand smoke; no lingering odor in hair, clothing and furniture, no ashes and no stains to fingers and teeth.

4. What makes you think smokers want it?

They told us so. Smokers clearly want a cigarette that provides smoking enjoyment, good taste and aroma; And they want a cigarette that eliminates or minimizes aspects they don’t like – such as lingering odor, stains on fingers and teeth, as well as ashes. In addition, they want to avoid the annoyance associated with second-hand smoke. The new cigarette reduces second-hand smoke by 90 percent. Because there is virtually no smoke off the lit end and the exhaled smoke dissipates quickly, it is much less annoying to non-smokers than smoke from other cigarettes. Smokers and most non-smokers are both interested in accommodation.

5. What makes you think smokers will buy this?

(Same answer as #4)

6. Is this just a gimmick to capture new smokers?

Absolutely not. Some 900 cigarette styles are available in the U.S. market. This is simply another choice for smokers who want tobacco taste and enjoyment with significantly less second-hand smoke, no lingering odor, stains or ashes.

7. Is this cigarette intended to get former smokers to begin again?
